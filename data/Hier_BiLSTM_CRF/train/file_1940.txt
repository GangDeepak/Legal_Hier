Assessee is the manufacturer of fertilizers at their facility at Goa.	None
It obtained registration of all their imports required for expansion of their fertilizer project under the provisions of the Project Import Regulations, 1986 (for short the PIR).	Facts
In respect of the said expansion, the goods imported were entitled to the benefit of Project Import Assessment under Heading 98.01 of the Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and correspondingly the company was entitled to the benefit of customs exemption Notification No. 11/97 dated 1.3.1997.	Facts
The said notification specified nil rate of duty in respect of goods required for fertilizer plant.	Facts
Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers was the duly constituted Sponsoring Authority under the said PIR.	Facts
The said Ministry had issued a certificate dated 22.10.1997 (Essentiality Certificate) to the effect that the import of capital goods for expansion of the fertilizer project stood examined and the list of goods annexed to the certificate had been attested from the essentiality angle by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.	Facts
At this stage, it may be noted that in their application for issuance of essentiality certificate, the assessee had stated that on account of load shedding in the concerned area, a Captive Power Plant was essential for the substantial expansion of the fertilizer project.	Facts
By the said essentiality certificate dated 22.10.1997, the sponsoring Ministry requested the Customs to exempt the customs duty on import of equipments by the assessee vide Notification No. 11/97.	Facts
The said certificate indicated vide item nos.	Facts
14.a and 14.b, a 6 Mega Watt Captive Power Plant.	Facts
The essentiality certificate recommended the said Captive Power Plant as part of the entire capital goods required by the assesseecompany for substantial expansion of the fertilizer project.	Arguments of Petitioner
As stated above, the dispute which arises in the present case is the rate of duty applicable to the imports made by the assessee for the fertilizer project.	Issue
According to the Department, the goods imported under serial nos.14.a and 14.b of annexure A to the essentiality certificate did not fall under serial no.	Facts
226(i) of the said notification no. 11/97 and, therefore, the assessee was not entitled to the benefit of nil rate of duty in respect of 6 MW Captive Power Plant.	Facts
According to the Department, items 14.a and 14.b fell under serial no. 226(iii) which stated that Captive Power Plants of 5 MW or more are liable to duty at 20 2 and additional duty of 13.	Facts
By the impugned order of adjudication, the Adjudicating Authority held that 6 MW Captive Power Plant imported under Heading 98.01 as part of the fertilizer project, in terms of the essentiality certificate, cannot be given the benefit of nil rate of duty, which was available only to fertilizer projects.	Facts
In other words, according to the Department, the fertilizer project and the Captive Power Plant are two distinct and separate projects as far as the rate of duty was concerned.	Facts
This contention of the Department has been accepted by all the authorities below.	Facts
It has been confirmed even by the CEGAT vide the impugned judgment dated 15.11.2001.	Facts

There is no dispute regarding other items mentioned in the list.	Arguments of Respondent
Regarding those items, the Department has accepted that they have been attested by the Sponsoring Ministry.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Department, the only dispute is with regard to the Captive Power Plant.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Department, Captive Power Plant needs to be segregated from the fertilizer project on the ground that the fertilizer project can work even without the Captive Power Plant and that the output from the fertilizer project can be produced even without the Captive Power Plant.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Department, the power plant is a separate project by itself.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Department the power plant is not a component or an integral part of the fertilizer project.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Department, 6 MW Power Plant consisted of a generating set which operated on diesel.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Department, even if on the technical side a Captive Power Plant constituted an aid to the working of the fertilizer project still for the purposes of chargeability one has to go by the strict interpretation of the exemption notification no.	Arguments of Respondent
11/97 under which the rate of duty is nil for the fertilizer project whereas it is 20 for the power generation project.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Department, since fertilizer project and power generation project are two different and independent projects, the assessee was not entitled to claim nil rate of duty in respect of 6 MW Captive Power Plant.8.	Arguments of Respondent
On the other hand, on behalf of the assessee, the case put up before all the authorities was that, once an Essentiality Certificate was issued by the Sponsoring Ministry, it was not open to the Revenue to go behind that certificate.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the assessee, an essentiality certificate constituted a proof of fulfillment of the eligibility conditions by the importer for obtaining the benefit of exemption notification.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the assessee, project imports fell under a specific Heading 98.01.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the assessee, the import of capital goods indicated in the list annexed to the essentiality certificate showed that the sponsoring Ministry cleared the project on the footing that, in this particular case, looking to the ground reality in the area in which the plant was located, in which there was paucity of electricity, 6 MW Captive Power Plant was an essential requirement for expansion of the fertilizer project.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the assessee, the essentiality certificate along with the attested list constituted a proof of the need to expand the fertilizer project and for that Captive Power Plant was an essential part.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the assessee, it was not open to the Revenue to say that the Captive Power Plant was not an essential requirement for the expansion of the fertilizer project, once an essentiality certificate stands issued by the sponsoring Ministry.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, reliance is placed by the assessee on the judgment of this court in the case of Commissioner of Customs (Imports), Mumbai vs. Tullow India Operations Ltd. reported in (2005) 13 SCC 789.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance is also placed by the assessee on the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Asiatic Oxygen Ltd. vs. Assistant Collector of Customs reported in 1992 (57) ELT 563.	Arguments of Petitioner
We find merit in this civil appeal filed by the assessee for the following reasons.10.	Reasoning
Firstly, on the facts we find that the assessee had given to the sponsoring Ministry its entire Project Report.	Reasoning
In that report they had indicated that for the expansion of the fertilizer project they needed an extra item of capital goods, namely, 6MW Captive Power Plant.	Reasoning
In their application, the assessee had made it clear that the fertilizer project was dependent on continuous flow of electricity, which could be provided by such Captive Power Plant.	Reasoning
Therefore, it was not open to the Revenue to reject the assessees case for nil rate of duty on the said item, particularly when the certificate says so.	Reasoning
In the judgment of this Court in the case of Tullow India Operations Ltd. (supra), this Court held that essentiality certificate must be treated as a proof of fulfillment of the eligibility conditions by the importer for obtaining the benefit of the exemption notification.	Reasoning
We may add that, the essentiality certificate is also a proof that an item like Captive Power Plant in a given case could be treated as a capital goods for the fertilizer project.	Reasoning
It would depend upon the facts of each case.	Reasoning
It a project is to be installed in an area where there is shortage of electricity supply and if the project needs continuous flow of electricity and if that project is approved by the sponsoring Ministry saying that such supply is needed then the Revenue cannot go behind such certificate and deny the benefit of exemption from payment of duty or deny nil rate of duty.	Reasoning
To the said effect is the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Asiatic Oxygen Ltd. (supra) in which it was held that the object behind the specific Heading 98.01 in Customs Tariff Act, 1975 was to promote industrialization and, therefore, the heading was required to be interpreted liberally.	Reasoning
It was further held that, once an essentiality certificate was issued by the sponsoring authority, it was mandatory for the Revenue to register the contract.11.	Reasoning
Secondly, before us, it has been vehemently urged that although the essentiality certificate stood issued by the sponsoring Ministry, there is nonapplication of mind by that Ministry with regard to the list of items appended to the certificate.	Reasoning
According to the Department the said list has not been countersigned by the competent authority in the sponsoring Ministry.	Reasoning
We do not find any merit in the said contention.	Reasoning
The list consists of 14 items.	Reasoning
The Department has accepted 13 out of 14 items as capital goods required for the fertilizer project, therefore, it cannot be said that the sponsoring Ministry had not applied its mind to the list appended to the essentiality certificate.	Reasoning
This point needs further clarification.	Reasoning
The power plant in the conceptual sense or in the technical sense is certainly different from the fertilizer plant.	Reasoning
However, when we come to Heading 98.01 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, the assessment is for the Project.	Reasoning
As stated above, Heading 98.01 is the specific entry applicable in the case of the Project Imports.	Reasoning
An item like a power plant could be in a given case in independent Plant.	Reasoning
Generally, it is a standalone equipment.	None
However, when it becomes a part of the entire Project System, the same power plant can also become one of the items of capital goods.	Reasoning
The essentiality certificate given by the sponsoring Ministry has treated Captive Power Plant, in this case, as capital goods along with 13 other items.	Reasoning
The assessee has also treated the Captive Power Plant as one of the capital goods required for the expansion of the fertilizer project.	Reasoning
In the above circumstances, all the items in the list annexed to the certificate have been certified and recommended by the sponsoring Ministry as the entire capital goods required for the substantial expansion of the fertilizer project.	Reasoning
Therefore, in our view, the assessee is right in its contention that, in this case, 6 MW Captive Power Plant is one of the items out of 14 items constituting capital goods required for the substantial expansion of the fertilizer project, and, therefore, it fell under serial no.	Reasoning
226(i) as goods required for the fertilizer project entitled to the benefit of nil rate of duty.12.	Reasoning
Before concluding, we may point out that, on behalf of the Department, a large number of authorities were cited on interpretation of entries in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975.	Reasoning
It is not necessary to examine those authorities on interpretation.	Reasoning
Suffice it to state that, Heading 98.01 is a specific entry.	Reasoning
It is not a general entry.	Reasoning
It is not a residuary entry.	Reasoning
It needs to be liberally interpreted as it deals with industrialization.	Reasoning
It has to be read in the context of the above Notification No. 11/97.13.	Reasoning
In the case of Appraiser, Madras Customs vs. Tamil Nadu Newsprint Papers Ltd. reported in 1988 (36) ELT 272 it has been held that Heading 84.66 (now 98.01) is not a residuary heading or a general heading relating to any class of goods.	Reasoning
It is the specific entry introduced with a purpose and it relates to goods imported for initial setting up of a unit or a substantial expansion of an existing unit.	Reasoning
It was held that when an importer registers a contract under the specific entry no. 84.66 (now 98.01), all the goods imported by him under that contract will be subjected to duty only as per that entry and it will not be open for the Revenue to pick out some of the goods imported under that contract and impose a different heading.	Reasoning
If the conditions prescribed under Heading 84.66 are satisfied, the duty shall be imposed on the goods under the said Heading 84.66 as if the said goods formed the composite unit.	Reasoning
In that case there was another Heading 84.31 which referred also to paper making machinery.	Reasoning
The Department contended that duty was payable on the said item under Heading 84.31.	Reasoning
It was held by Madras High Court that even if the rate of duty under Heading 84.31 was different from the rate of duty under Heading 84.66, still the rate applicable to the paper making machinery imported for producing papers under the PIR has to fall under specific Heading 84.66 (now 98.01) and not under Heading 84.31, even if paper making machinery came under both the headings.	Reasoning
This is because once an item is imported under Project Imports then that items will fall under the specific entry because that item is imported as a part of composite unit (see para 10).	Reasoning
In our view, the said judgment of the Madras High Court on interpretation of Heading 98.01 is squarely applicable to the present case, particularly on the interpretation of the entries in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975.	Reasoning
For the above reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment of the CEGAT dated 15.11.2001 in appeal no.	Decision
C/277/Bom and accordingly the assessees appeal stands allowed with no order as to costs.	None
