None

The provision for granting exemption is part of the procedure prescribed by clause of the 1966 Control order.	None
The power to grant exemption cannot be said to be independent of the provisions under clause 5 of the order.	Reasoning
The object of the 1966 Control order is to promote sugar industry and to eliminate unnecessary impediments in the production of sugar.	Reasoning
It also ensures a fair deal to the growers of sugarcane.	Reasoning
The provisions of the Control order are intended to maintain harmony between the growers of sugarcane and the producers of sugar and to enable both of them to share profits reasonably.	Reasoning
Therefore, the power conferred on the Government is required to be exercised having regard to the viewpoints of the growers of sugarcane as well as the producers of sugar.	Reasoning
It is necessary to give opportunity to the growers of sugarcane as well as the producers of sugar to be heard when the Government exercises powers under 1966 Control order for determining the additional price and granting exemption from pay ment of additional price.	Reasoning
The grant, of exemption from payment of price affects rights and interests of the growers of sugarcane.	Reasoning
The Control order contains elaborate machinery for fixation of additional price having regard to all relevan t factors.	Reasoning
The additional price fixation authority afforded opportunity to both the growers of sugarcane as well as the producers of sugar to be heard in the determination of the additional price.	Reasoning
The subsequent order by the Government granti ng exemption to the factories for payment of additional price takes away rights which had a accrued in favour of the growers of sugarcane.15.	Reasoning
The manner of payment of additional price under clause S(6) of the 1966 Control order does not affect the right and interest of growers.	None
ln providing for payment of additional price, the additional price fixation authority takes into account the relevant considerations relating to the conditions of sugarcane growers as well as the promotion of the sugar industry during the relevant period.	Reasoning
The additional price fixation authority also considers the conditions and circumstances relating to the appellant factory in determining the additional price payable.	Reasoning
It, is, therefore, necessary for the Government to invite the points of view or objections of the growers on the application made by the factories producing sugar seeking exemption from payment of additional price.	Reasoning
It is equally necessary for the Government t o hear the growers of sugarcane in order to satisfy itself as to the bona fide and accuracy of the appellants claim for exemption.	Reasoning
The growers should be given an opportunity to show whether the claim by the appellant for exemption from payment of additional price should or should not be granted.16.	None
The power to grant exemption to factories from payment of additional price is ultimately connected with the right of sugarcane growers to claim additional price.	None
The situations in which a duty will arise to act judicially according to natural justice cannot be exhaustively enumerated.	Reasoning
A duty to act judicially will arise in the exercise of a power to deprive a person of legitimate interest or expectation that additional price would be paid.	Reasoning
The factors which power to an exercise of powers judicially are the nature of the interest to be affected, the circumstances in which the power falls to be exercised and the nature of the sanction, if any, involved.	Reasoning
It is clear that the purpose and purport of the 1966 Control order, the scheme of having sugarcane growing areas reserved for factories and in particular, the payment of additional price point to the inescapable conclusion that the sugarcane growers are to be heard not only when additional price is filed but also when any exemption is granted to factories from payment of additional price.17.	Reasoning
For these reasons, the judgment of the High Court is affirmed.	Decision
The appeals are dismissed.	Decision
Each party will pay and bear its own costs.18.	Decision
Appeals dismissed.	Decision
