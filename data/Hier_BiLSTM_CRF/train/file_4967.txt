Facts
That application was forwarded to Medical Council of India (for short MCI) for evaluation and making recommendations to the Ministry under Section 10A of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 (for short 1956 Act).	Facts
The Executive Committee of MCI considered the proposal pertaining to the aforementioned new medical college in its meeting convened on 27.02.2016.	Facts
It was noted that the land on which the new college was proposed to be made was not entered in the name of Dr. Jagat Narain Subharti Charitable Trust.	Facts

The Executive Committee of MCI, in its meeting held on 13.05.2016, reiterated its earlier decision of disapproval of the scheme for the academic session 201617 and submitted negative recommendation to the Central Government recommending disapproval of the scheme under Section 10A of the 1956 Act.

As the petitioners did not receive any intimation from the competent authority, they were left with no alternative but to move a writ petition before this Court, being Writ Petition (Civil) No.513 of 2017 on 07.07.2017, seeking direction against respondent No.1 to confirm the letter of permission dated 26.09.2016 and to grant permission to the petitioners to admit 150 students in the MBBS course of petitioner No.2 medical college for the academic session 201718 and further, to direct respondent No.4 to allot 150 students through Central Counselling for academic session 201718 in the MBBS course of petitioner No.2 medical college.

Mr. P.S. Narsimha, learned Additional Solicitor General is also requested to assist the Court.	None
Notwithstanding the knowledge about pendency of the said writ petition, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India hastened to debar the petitioner college from admitting students for two academic sessions i.e. 201718 201819 and also authorised the MCI to encash the Bank Guarantee of Rs.2 crores offered by the petitioners.4.	Facts
The aforementioned Writ Petition (Civil) No.513 of 2017 was then heard on 01.08.2017, during which the following order came to be passedOrderHeard Mr. Amarendra Sharan and Mr. Ajit Sinha, learned senior counsel along with Mr. Vivek Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners, Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India and Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel along with Mr. Gaurav Sharma, learned counsel for the Medical Council of India.	Facts
It is the admitted position that the controversy in the present matter is covered by the judgment rendered today in Glocal Medical College and Super Speciality Hospital and Research Centre Vs. Union of India W.P. (c) No.411 of 2017.	Facts
The same shall apply in all fours to the case in hand.	Facts
Be it noted, the date of order passed by the Central Government or communication thereof will not make any difference to the directions which have been passed in the case of Glocal Medical College and Super Speciality Hospital and Research Centre (supra).List the matter on 24th August, 2017.As the Ministry hastened to issue the communication dated 25.07.2017, the petitioners were left with no option but to challenge the said decision by filing a separate writ petition being Writ Petition (Civil) No.681 of 2017, filed on 28.07.2017.5.	Facts
Be that as it may, pursuant to the aforementioned order dated 01.08.2017 of this Court, the matter was reconsidered by the Hearing Committee.	Facts
An opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner college by the Hearing Committee on 08.08.2017.	Facts
The explanation offered by the petitioners in respect of the deficiencies earlier noticed did not commend to the Hearing Committee.	Facts
On the basis of the report received from the Hearing Committee, the Under Secretary to the Government of India issued communicationcumorder dated 14.08.2017 reiterating its earlier decision of debarring the college from admitting students for a period of two years i.e. 201718 and 201819 and also authorised the MCI to encash the Bank Guarantee of Rs.2 crores.	Facts
The relevant portion of the said communication, reads thus.17.	None
Now, in compliance with the above direction of Honble Supreme Court dated 1.8.2017, the Ministry granted hearing to the college on 8.8.2017.	None
The Hearing Committee after considering the record and submission of the college submitted its report to the Ministry.	Facts
Findings of Hearing Committee are as underThe Committee notes that the inspection was carried out on 2627.10.2016 just prior to Diwali.	Facts
This is bound to reflect in less than average availability against major parameters.	Facts
The college has tried to explain the deficiency of faculty, Residents, OPD and bed occupancy on this ground.	Facts
The Committee noted that MCI in its recommendation has also held that the college is disqualified on qualifying criteria since the Trust does not own 20 acres land.	Facts
The representative of college informed that the land is owned in the name of two Trusts viz.	Facts
Sri Sri 1008 Narayan Swami Trust and Dr. Jagat Narayan Subharti Trust.	Facts
As per para 6A of the AmendedTrust Deed registered on 15.09.2011 the name of the Trust was changed from Sri Sri 1008 Narayan Swami Trust to Dr. Jagat Narayan Subharti Trust.	Facts
In the definition clause of Subharti University State Act 2016, in Section 2(rr) Trust means Subharti Trust covered by both names.	Facts
All properties registered under the name of Sri Sri 1008 Narayan Swami Trust come under the ownership of Jagat Narayan Subharti Trust.	Facts
The College also produced letter dated 01.03.2016 from DM., Dehradun to the college certifying its land ownership.	Facts
The college was asked why it not obtained form 5 regarding land ownership as per MCI Regulations.	Facts
The college informed that the form 5 was prescribed from October 2015 and the college made application for establishment before that.	Facts
The trust representative was very categorical that they had applied for permission for establishment only for 201415 and the conditional LoP in 201617 was issued in continuation to their earlier application.	Facts
This is obviously an incorrect statement.	Facts
The Committee observes that the full details regarding the land ownership of the college are available with the Ministry.	Facts
Hence the Ministry may decide appropriately.	Facts
Prima facie it appears that the college owns 20 acres of land.	Facts
In view of the deficiencies and findings as above, the Committee agrees with the decision of the Ministry vide letter dated 25.7.2017 to debar the college for two years and also permit MCI to encash bank guarantee.18.	Facts
Accepting the recommendations of Hearing Committee, the Ministry reiterates its earlier decision dated 25.7.2017 to debar the college from admitting students for a period of 2 years i.e. 201718 201819 and also to authorize MCI to encash Bank Guarantee of Rs.2 Crores.(emphasis supplied)6.	Facts
After the receipt of the aforementioned decision of the Ministry dated 14.08.2017, the petitioners have filed two separate Interlocutory Applications in the respective writ petitions which were still pending before this Court, concerning the subject matter of debarring the petitioner college from admitting students in the MBBS course for the academic session 201718.	Facts
By these applications, being I.A. No.74980 of 2017 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.513 of 2017 and I.A. No.75275 of 2017 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.681 of 2017, the petitioners have prayed for quashing the communication cum order dated 14.08.2017 issued under the signature of the Under Secretary, Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and to direct respondent No.1 to immediately issue letter of permission to the petitioners for the academic session 201718 to enable the petitioners to admit the students for the academic session 201718.	Issue
These applications were filed on 17.08.2017.	None
As a result, these applications along with the main writ petitions proceeded for hearing on 24.08.2017.7.	Facts
The principal grievance of the petitioners is that the Hearing Committee had once again committed manifest error in submitting negative recommendations against the petitioners and that the Ministry mechanically acted upon those recommendations without considering the relevant material placed on record by the petitioners with regard to the deficiencies noted in paragraph 17 of the impugned decision.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended by the petitioners that even on a liberal reading of paragraph 17, the deficiencies which had weighed with the competent authority in passing adverse order against the petitioners were in respect of faculty, residents, OPD and Bed Occupancy, which were already considered on the earlier occasion and the explanation given by the petitioners had found favour with the OC.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the impugned communication, there is no opinion much less any positive finding given by the Hearing Committee or the competent authority that the explanation offered by the petitioners for the deficiencies noticed during the inspection on 26/27.10.2016 was not plausible as it was done just prior to Diwali.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the central issue held out against the petitioners was about not fulfilling the qualifying criteria regarding ownership of 20 acres of land.	Arguments of Petitioner
On this matter, however, the Hearing Committee was prima facie convinced but left it to the wisdom of the Ministry to decide appropriately.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Ministry, in turn, has not expressed any positive opinion in that behalf, even though the petitioners had produced official records which clearly indicated that the litigation before the Revenue Authority has concluded in favour of the petitioners and that the petitioners have been declared as owners of 20 acres of land.	Arguments of Petitioner
This aspect has been completely glossed over by the competent authority of the Government of India, for which reason the conclusion reached by the said authority suffers from nonapplication of mind and nonconsideration of the relevant material placed before it.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the other concern expressed by the Hearing Committee was about nonsubmission of information in Form5 regarding land ownership.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even this concern of the Hearing Committee and the competent authority, contend the petitioners, is misplaced considering the fact that the requirement to submit information in Form5 came into force w.e.f. 16.10.2015 consequent to the amendment notification issued by the MCI in that behalf.	Arguments of Petitioner
Whereas, the petitioners had submitted application for grant of permission to establish the medical college initially in 2013, then on 30.08.2014 and again on 31.08.2015.	Arguments of Petitioner
The application filed on 31.08.2015 was the basis for grant of conditional letter of permission, to start the medical course for the academic session 201617.	None
The Hearing Committee as well as the competent authority has merely observed that the stand taken by the petitioners in this behalf was incorrect, without explaining anything further.	None
It is, therefore, submitted that the impugned communication dated 14.08.2017 issued by the Ministry is illegal and deserves to be quashed and directions be issued to the respondents to allow the petitioners to admit students in the MBBS course for the academic session 201718.	Arguments of Petitioner
The petitioners also undertake to remove any other deficiency that may be brought to its notice in the future with promptitude.8.	None
The respondents, on the other hand, have justified their action on the basis of the material considered by the Hearing Committee and the competent authority of the Central Government.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that the qualifying criteria regarding ownership of 20 acres of land is inviolable.	Arguments of Respondent
The petitioners having failed to fulfill the same, no fault can be found with the respondents for having issued the impugned communication dated 14.08.2017.	Arguments of Respondent
According to them, it is a well considered decision.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that considering the nature of deficiencies noticed by the assessors during inspection and the explanation offered by the petitioners being insufficient, the proper course was to revoke the letter of permission as it was granted to the petitioners conditionally.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that the fact that the petitioners had filed an application before October 2015 would not extricate the petitioners from furnishing information as required in Form5.	None
In substance, the submission of the respondents is that the entire matter has been reconsidered by the Hearing Committee as also the competent authority and the reasons recorded by the competent authority are germane for revoking the letter of permission and debarring the college for two academic sessions and for encashing the Bank Guarantee of Rs.2 crores furnished by the petitioners.9.	Arguments of Respondent
Having considered the rival submissions and after perusing the records, we are more than convinced that the impugned communication dated 14.08.2017 cannot stand the test of judicial scrutiny.	Reasoning
As can be discerned from paragraph 17, essentially, three factors have weighed with the Hearing Committee and the competent authority of the Central Government while debarring the petitioner college for two academic sessions.	Reasoning
The first is about the deficiencies of faculty, residents, OPD and Bed Occupancy.	Reasoning
The petitioners had offered explanation in relation to each of these deficiencies.	Reasoning
The OC, after considering the explanation, had opined that the petitioners had shown sufficient cause and that the deficiencies, if any, were within the permissible norms.	Reasoning
This is evident from the communication of the OC dated 14.05.2017.	Reasoning
Neither the Hearing Committee nor the competent authority of the Central Government has dwelt upon the stated explanation given by the petitioners and which had found favour with the OC, as noted in its communication dated 14.05.2017.	Reasoning
No finding has been recorded by the Hearing Committee or the competent authority of the Central Government that the said view expressed by the OC is inappropriate or incorrect.	Reasoning
Notably, in paragraph 17 of the impugned communication, the competent authority of the Central Government has recorded the observation of the Hearing Committee that inspection carried out on 26/27.10.2016 was just prior to Diwali and was bound to reflect on the attendance of the Faculty, Residents and OPD as well as Bed Occupancy.	Reasoning
The competent authority has stopped at that.	Reasoning
It has not rejected the said explanation as incorrect or bogus.	Reasoning
On the other hand, the impression gathered from the contents of paragraph 17 of the impugned communication is that the Hearing Committee as well as the competent authority of the Central Government has not rejected the explanation offered by the petitioners college.	Reasoning
If that is so, deficiency in respect of Faculty, Residents, OPD and Bed Occupancy cannot be held against the petitioners moreso when the OC, on the basis of the same material, had opined that the deficiency regarding faculty at the relevant time was only 6.15, which was within the norms.	Reasoning
Even the deficiency of residents was answered in favour of the petitioners by observing that there was no deficiency.	Reasoning
The explanation of the college with regard to OPD attendance and Bed Occupancy was found to be reasonable, sufficient and valid by the OC.	Reasoning
Accordingly, the first aspect highlighted in paragraph 17 in relation to the deficiency of Faculty, Residents, OPD and Bed Occupancy, cannot be held against the petitioners.10.	Reasoning
Reverting to the main issue, which presumably weighed with the Hearing Committee and the competent authority of the Central Government, about the non fulfillment of qualifying criteria regarding ownership of 20 acres land, even this is a nonexistent issue.	None
Going by the observations in paragraph 17, it is obvious that the Hearing Committee has recorded a prima facie opinion that the college owns 20 acres of land but it wanted the competent authority of the Central Government to ponder over the said aspect in depth as full details regarding land were available with the Ministry.	Reasoning
The competent authority of the Central Government, however, has not analysed any aspect regarding the land record depicting the ownership of 20 acres of land.	Reasoning
Significantly, the petitioners relied on the recent decision of the Revenue Authority which clinches the issue regarding ownership and area of the land.	None
In that, the Court Assistant Collector, First Class, Vikas Nagar, Dehradun has passed a detailed judgment on 25.07.2017 to answer the dispute brought before it under Section 143 of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act and has held that the lands referred to in the said decision are nonagricultural lands and entered in the name of the petitioners as owners in the revenue record.	None
We are not called upon to examine the correctness of this decision nor we may be understood to have concluded that issue.	None
The fact remains that this judgment was placed before the competent authority.	Reasoning
The said decision has been marked as annexure P29 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.681 of 2017.	Reasoning
From the said decision, it is indisputable that the petitioners have been declared as owners of the land referred to in the said case Nos.100 and 101 of 201617.	Reasoning
As stated earlier, even the Hearing Committee has not expressed any adverse opinion on this account.	None
Rather, the Hearing Committee has prima facie noted that the college owns 20 acres of land.	Reasoning
The competent authority has palpably failed to analyse the relevant record regarding land ownership of the college, as is evident from the observation contained in paragraph 17 of the impugned decision.11.	Reasoning
The third aspect noted in the impugned decision in paragraph 17 is about the nonfurnishing of information regarding land ownership in Form5.	None
We are at a loss to appreciate as to on what basis the Hearing Committee and the competent authority of the Central Government have found the stand taken by the petitioners in that behalf as an incorrect submission.	None
We find that the petitioners had submitted applications for permission to establish the medical college initially in 2013 followed by another application on 30.08.2014 and lastly on 31.08.2015.	Reasoning
On the basis of the last application dated 31.08.2015, the petitioners were granted permission to start the medical college from the academic session 201617 on conditions specified in the permission.	Reasoning
At best, it can be said that the said application dated 31.08.2015 was not for establishment of college for the academic session 201415.	Reasoning
But it is indisputable that the letter of permission was granted to the petitioners for the academic session 201617 on the basis of their application dated 31.08.2015.	None
Having said this, it must follow that the application preferred by the petitioners under consideration was made before 16.10.2015.	Reasoning
The requirement to submit information regarding ownership of land in Form5 came into force after the amendment notification dated 16.10.2015 bearing No.MCI34/41/15Med./142035.	None
In addition, the petitioners have rightly pointed out that the information regarding ownership of land as was furnished by them was dependent on the communication issued by the D.M. being annexure P5 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.513 of 2017, which contains all the requisite details as were required for the purpose of Form5.	Reasoning
Thus, there has been substantial compliance of the said requirement by the petitioners.	None
Assuming that the notification dated 16.10.2015 applied even to the proposal of the petitioners, suffice it to observe that failure to furnish information in the prescribed Form5 cannot be held against the petitioners.	Reasoning
In any case, that is not a deficiency relating to infrastructure or academic matters as such, which may require a different approach.	Reasoning
Accordingly, even this aspect does not detain us from concluding that the impugned decision of the competent authority suffers from the vice of non application of mind, if not perverse.12.	Reasoning
This leaves us with no other option but to conclude that the reconsideration of the matter by the Central Government was a mere formality in this case.	Reasoning
No sincere effort has been made by the competent authority of the Central Government to analyse the material placed on record.	Reasoning
This is nothing short of abdication of statutory duty.	Reasoning
That cannot be countenanced especially when the matter was sent back to the competent authority by this Court vide order dated 01.08.2017 for recording reasons.13.	Reasoning
As no other deficiency has been noted by the competent authority of the Central Government in the impugned decision dated 14th August, 2017, and that the three factors which weighed with the competent authority having been found to be palpably untenable and, more particularly, in spite of this Court having called upon the competent authority to reconsider the matter with a hope that all the grievances of the petitioners would be properly dealt with, it opted to pass a cryptic and mechanical order which suffers from the vice of non application of mind, if not perverse.	Reasoning
The only course open for us is to allow these writ petitions by not only setting aside the impugned decision dated 14th August, 2017, but also directing the respondents to permit the petitionercollege to admit up to 150 students for the academic session 201718, as was permitted for the academic session 201617.	Reasoning
We are conscious of the regulation providing for the cutoff date to accord permission for establishment of a new college or for renewal of the permission to impart MBBS course, including the decision of this Court mandating adherence to the said cutoff date.	None
Notwithstanding such stipulation, we are persuaded to direct the concerned authorities to allow the petitionercollege to admit up to 150 students until 05.09.2017, in the peculiar facts of the present case and in exercise of our plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India to do complete justice.	Reasoning
In other words, we are inclined to relax the cutoff date qua the petitioners and issue directions to the concerned authority, being convinced that none of the three factors which weighed with the competent authority is sustainable and that the petitionercollege has already admitted students to the first year MBBS course for the academic session 201617 after the recommendation of the OC in that behalf and has complied with the conditions for grant of such permission by the competent authority.14.	Reasoning
This decision, however, will not be an impediment for the MCI and the competent authority to inspect the college as and when deemed fit and, if any deficiency is found after giving opportunity to the petitionercollege, to proceed against the college in accordance with law.	Reasoning
That arrangement will subserve the ends of justice and also ensure larger public interest.	Reasoning
For, the compliant medical college, having capacity to admit up to 150 students for the MBBS course in the academic session 201718, will not have to face the situation of its 150 seats remaining unutilized entailing in denial of opportunity to 150 aspiring students who are desirous of pursuing medical course but are unable to take admission in other medical colleges in order of their merit.15.

Therefore, the emphasis is on the compliant institution.16.	None
Considering the fact that the admission process for the academic session 201718 is still in progress and the last date fixed for counseling is 31st August, 2017, we are inclined to issue directions to all concerned to permit the petitionercollege to admit up to 150 students until 05.09.2017 to the MBBS course for the academic session 201718, with liberty to MCI and the competent authority to inspect the petitionercollege and if any deficiency is noticed, to proceed against the petitionercollege in accordance with law.17.	Decision
Accordingly, we allow these writ petitions and interlocutory applications.	Decision
The impugned decision of the competent authority of the Central Government dated 14th August, 2017, is quashed and set aside.	Decision
Further, respondents are directed to permit the petitionercollege to admit up to 150 students until 05.09.2017 for the academic session 201718 and allot students through the central counselling in order of their merit for the academic session 201718 in the MBBS course.18.	Decision
