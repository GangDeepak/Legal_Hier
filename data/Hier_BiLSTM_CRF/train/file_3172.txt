This is an appeal by special leave against the above decision of the High Court.2.	Issue
Shortly stated, the facts of the case are that Mahant Ganeshdas who was a wealthy person used to live in the temple of Shri Gopalji situated on a hillock near Panchota about a mile and a half from the village.	Facts
Ganpatia Daroga used to live with him at the temple.	Facts
On the morning of 111948 it was discovered that both of them were lying dead in the temple.	Facts
Death took place on account of the injuries caused to them by means of an axe.	Facts
The house had also been ransacked and boxes and almirahs opened.	Facts
The matter was reported to the police by Thakur Daulat Singh, a notable of that village.	Facts
At the time the report was made it was not known how the Mahant and Ganpatia had met their end and who was responsible for the robbery and murder.3.	Facts
As a result of the investigation by the police the appellant Kaloo Khan was arrested on 1311948 and on the same day he produced a gold kanthi (Ex. P13/A) from his bara where it was lying buried in the ground.	Facts
Sanwat Khan, appellant, was arrested on 1811948 and on the 19th he produced a silver plate (tashak) bearing a certain inscription from his house where it lay buried in the groundThey were committed to the court of session with the result above mentioned.	Facts
The accused denied the charge and attributed their prosecution to enmity with Thakur Daulatsing, the jagirdar of the village.4.	Facts
There is no.	Facts
direct evidence whatsoever proving the participation of the two appellants in the murder of the Mahant and Ganpatia.	Facts
The learned Sessions Judge in convicting the appellants placed reliance on the evidence of one Madari, P. W. 7, and the recovery of the kanthi and tashak at their instance.	Facts
He also took into consideration the fact that the accused were seen near the place of occurrence on the day previous to the murder and that soon after they left the village.	Facts
Reliance was also placed on certain evidence connecting the accused with the axe, Ex. P5/A.The High Court, however, held that the evidence of Madari, P. W. 7, was not trustworthy and that it was not proved that the axe belonged to Kaloo Khan.	Facts
It further held that it was not correct to say that the accused had left the village after the occurrence because they had gone away to settle in a different place about a couple of months before this incident.	Facts
The other circumstances relied upon by the Sessions Judge were held to be of no. consequence.	Facts
Having rejected practically the whole of the circumstantial evidence on which the learned Sessions Judge had placed reliance, the High Court upheld the conviction of the appellants by relying on the solitary circumstances of the recovery of the two articles above mentioned at the instance of the accused.	Facts
It was said that in the absence of any explanation about the possession of the articles belonging to the Mahant by the accused, the inevitable inference was that they were persons who had some hand in the destardly act.5.	Facts
Mr. Umrigar for the appellants contended that the evidence of the recovery of the articles belonging to the deceased at the instance of the accused at the most could lead to a presumption that they were the thieves or had received the articles knowing them to be stolen property, but it was inconclusive on the question of their having committed the murders.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our judgment, this contention has force.	Reasoning
The unexplained possession of stolen property is the only circumstance appearing in the evidence against the accused charged with murder and theft, and they could not be convicted of murder unless their possession of the property could not no. be explained on any other hypothesis except that of murder.	Reasoning
In the absence of any evidence whatsoever of the circumstances in which the murders or the robbery took place, it could easily be envisaged that the accused at some time or other seeing the Mahant and Ganpatia murdered, removed the articles produced by them from the temple or received them from the person or persons who had committed the murder.	Reasoning
The prosecution led evidence to prove that Mangu Khan, the father of these two persons, was planning to murder the Mahant since a long time.	Reasoning
Madari P. W. 7, who is an exconvict, deposed that he was also being approached to join in the conspiracy to murder the Mahant.	None
It is not improbable that any of these two or somebody else might have murdered the Mahant and some of the stolen property came into the possession of these two brothers.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, in the absence of any direct or circumstantial evidence whatsoever, from the solitary circumstance of the unexplained recovery of the two articles from the houses of the two appellants the only inference that can be raised in view of illustration A to S. 114 of the Evidence Act is that they are either receivers of stolen property or were the persons who committed the theft, but it does not necessarily indicate that the theft and the murders took place at one and the same time.	Reasoning
The accused produced these articles about a fortnight after the theft and the maximum that can be said against them is that they received these goods knowing them to be stolen or that they themselves stole them but ion the absence of any other evidence, it is not possible to hold that they are guilty of murder as well.6.	Reasoning
The learned counsel for the State in support of the view taken by the High Court placed reliance on a decision of the Madras High Court in  QueenEmpress v. Sami, 13 Mad 426 (A).	Arguments of Respondent
The headnote of the report says thatRecent and unexplained possession of stolen property which would be presumptive evidence against the prisoners on the charge or robbery would similarly be evidence against them on the charge of murder.	None
This head note, however, does not accurately represent the decision given by the learned Judges.	None
In the particular circumstances of that case it was observed that in cases in which murder and robbery and shown to form parts of one transaction, recent and unexplained possession of the stolen property while it would be presumptive evidence against a prisoner on the charge of robbery would similarly be evidence against him on the charge of murder.	Reasoning
Here, there is no. evidence, direct or circumstantial, that the robbery and murder formed parts of one transaction.	Reasoning
It is not even known at what time of the night these events took place.	Reasoning
It was only late next morning that it was discovered that the Mahant and Ganpatia had been murdered and looted.	Reasoning
In our judgment, Beaumont, C. J., and Sen J. in  Bhikha Gober v Emperor, AIR 1943	Reasoning
Bom 458 (B) rightly held that the mere fact that an accused produced shortly after the murder ornaments which were on the murdered person is not enough to justify the inference that the accused must have committed the murder.	Reasoning
There must be some further material to connect to accused with the murder in order to hold him guilty of that offence.	None
Our attention was drawn to a number of decisions which have been summed up in a Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court in State v. Shankar Prasad AIR 1952 All 776 (C), in some of which a presumption was drawn of guilt from the circumstance of possession of stolen articles soon after a murder.	Arguments of Respondent
We have examined these cases and it appears to us that each one of these decisions was given on the evidence and circumstances established in that particular case and	None
no.	Reasoning
general proposition of law can be deduced from them.	Reasoning
In our judgment no.	Reasoning
hard and fast rule can be laid down as to what inference should be drawn from a certain circumstance.	Reasoning
Where, however, the only evidence against an accused person is the recovery of stolen property and although the circumstances may indicate that the theft and the murder must have been committed at the same time it is not safe to draw the inference that the person in possession of the stolen property was the murderer.	Reasoning
Suspicion cannot take the place of proof.7.	Reasoning
For the reasons given above we cannot maintain the conviction of the appellants under S. 302, I.P.C. and we, therefore, acquit them of that offence.	Reasoning
It is, however, clear that both the appellants either took part in the theft or received the stolen property with the knowledge that it had been stolen.	Reasoning
The appellants were charged with having committed theft in a building armed with certain weapons.	Reasoning
They can thus be convicted for having committed theft in a dwelling house.8.	Reasoning
We, therefore, hold them guilty of the offence under S. 380, I.P.C. Learned counsel appearing for them urged that in view of the fact that they have been undergoing the sentence of transportation for life for the last three years, the appropriate sentence in their case should be the one they have already undergone.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the contention that the punishment already suffered by the accused will meet the ends of justice in this case has force, and we accordingly sentence them under S. 380 I.P.C. to three years rigorous imprisonment and as they have already undergone it, we direct their release.	Reasoning
The appeal is allowed to the extent above indicated.9.	Reasoning
Appeal partly allowed.	Decision
