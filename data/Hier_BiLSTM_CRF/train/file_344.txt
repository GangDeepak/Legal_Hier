upto 14.05.2009.	Facts

Facts

17.	None
However, this Court in Special Appeal Defective No. 87 of 2016 by its order dated 15.02.2016 had set aside the punishment order dated 14.05.2009 and directed that the appellant shall be entitled to consequential reliefs.	None
This Court having directed the petitioner to be given all consequential benefits and the order dated 14th of May, 2009 being quashed, the petitioner was entitled to salary w.e.f. 02.02.2007 up to 14.05.2009, the date, the punishment order was passed of reduction in basic pay by two stages.	Facts

5.8 With regard to claim of salary of the appellant after 14.05.2009, learned Single Judge took the view that the order dated 26.06.2012 having been set aside by learned Single Judge on 29.05.2015, which judgment was unsuccessfully challenged in this Court and has attained finality, hence salary w.e.f. 14.05.2009 to 20.06.2012 cannot be denied and direction was issued to pay salary with 18 interest.	Facts
With regard to other claims, the High Court noticed the payments made to the respondent towards provident fund, gratuity fund, GSLI Claim, Leave Encashment and other payments totalling Rs.25,73,830/.5.9 There is no other issue in the present appeal except direction for payment of salary after 14.05.2009 to 20.06.2012.	Facts
Learned counsel for the appellant submits that High Court committed error in directing for payment of salary after 14.05.2009 to 20.06.2012, whereas the respondent absented from work during the period and was clearly not entitled for payment of salary on the principle of ?	Arguments of Petitioner
No Work No Pay?.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that present is not a case where by virtue of any order terminating the services of the respondent, he could not work.	Arguments of Petitioner
With regard to salary after 14.05.2009 till 20.06.2012, learned Single Judge has not adjudicated the claim except observing that in view of the judgment of High Court dated 29.05.2015 against which special leave petition was dismissed, respondent was entitled for arrears of salary.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further submits that the fact that by virtue of the judgment of learned Single Judge dated 29.05.2015, respondent has to be treated in service does not automatically result in any direction to pay the salary, since no such direction was issued in the judgment of learned Single Judge dated 29.05.2015.	Arguments of Petitioner
The payment of salary for the aforesaid period does not automatically flow from the judgment of learned Single Judge.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submits that the fund of the appellant company being public fund, the payment of salary cannot be made when the respondent kept himself away from the work.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondent appearing in person refuted the submissions of the appellant and submits that he was entitled for salary since his dismissal order dated 26.06.2012 was set aside on 29.05.2015, against which special leave petition filed by the company had been dismissed by this Court on 18.09.2015.	Arguments of Respondent
He submits that he went to join the Branch Office at Allahabad on 23.07.2007	Arguments of Respondent
but he was not permitted to take charge by Branch Manager of Branch Office1, Allahabad.	Arguments of Respondent
He has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Shobha Ram Raturi Vs.	Arguments of Respondent
Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited and Others, (2016) 16 SCC 663.	Arguments of Respondent
He submits that the principle of ?	Arguments of Respondent
No Work	Arguments of Respondent
No Pay? does not apply in the facts of the present case and learned Single Judge has rightly directed for payment of salary after 14.05.2009 to 20.06.2012.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the records.	None
In Writ Petition No. 59041 of 2014, two set of orders were challenged namely the order dated 14.05.2009, by which for unauthorised absence for the period 02.02.2007 to 07.06.2007, he was awarded punishment of reduction of basic pay by two steps and secondly, the order dated 26.06.2012 terminating his services and order dated 18.07.2014 dismissing his departmental appeal.	None
Learned Single Judge has set aside the order dated 26.06.2012 vide its judgment dated 29.05.2015 as noted above.	Reasoning
The learned Single Judge quashed the order dated 26.06.2012 on following two grounds one, second charge sheet alleging unauthorised absence for 663 days was never served on the respondent and second, the respondent having retired from service on 20.06.2012, no order terminating his services could have been passed on 26.06.2012.	None
The relevant discussion and order of the learned Single Judge with regard to order dated 26.06.2012 is as follows There is nothing on record to show that the chargesheet was ever sought to be served upon the petitioner through registered post and it is not known as to from where this endorsement has come and to who wrote the remark ?	None
GHAR BAND RAHTA HAI?	None
or ?not met?.	None
Even, if it is assumed that the petitioner was not at his house and therefore the house was closed, it was expected of the respondents to have taken steps to notify the petitioner about the chargesheet through newspaper publication.	None
Nothing has been mentioned in the counter affidavit as to whether this procedure was adopted.	None
Therefore, it is quite clear that the chargesheet was never served upon the petitioner till 20.06.2012 and thereafter the order of removal from service was passed on 26.06.2012.	None
In this view of the matter, the petitioner cannot be said to have had notice of the enquiry proceedings and therefore if the respondents proceeded to hold enquiry ex parte, such proceedings are clearly vitiated and it must be held that the petitioner has been denied reasonable and adequate opportunity of hearing.	None
There is another aspect of the matter.	None
The petitioners case is that he retired from service on 20.06.2012 and the order of termination was passed on 26.06.2012.	None
The averments in paragraph 39 of the counter affidavit are also to the effect that the petitioner retired from service and even on the date of retirement he had refused to accept the chargesheet and absconded from office.	None
This being so once the petitioner retired from service on 20.06.2012 no order terminating his services could have been passed on 26.06.2012 as he ceased to be in service of the respondents w.e.f.	None
20.06.2012.	None
A person cannot be removed from service after he has already retired from service.	None
In this view of the matter, the impugned orders dated 26.06.2012 and 18.07.2014 cannot survive and are accordingly quashed.	None
The writ petition is allowed.?	None
As noted above, learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition insofar as order dated 14.05.2009 is concerned, challenge to which order stood accepted by Division Bench in Special Appeal No. 87 of 2016, where Division Bench has set aside the order dated 14.05.2009 and directed for payment with consequential benefits.	None
In pursuance of the order of the Division Bench dated 15.02.2016, the respondent is entitled to receive salary from 02.02.2007 to 14.05.2009 with regard to which we have not entertained the appeal.	Reasoning
Now, the issue, which has to be answered by us is as to whether by setting aside of the order dated 26.06.2012, the respondent was automatically entitled for back wages.	Issue
A perusal of the judgment of learned Single Judge dated 29.05.2015 indicates that although learned Single Judge has set aside the order dated 26.06.2012, but there was no order for payment of back wages or consequential benefits.	Reasoning
Learned Single Judge has set aside the order dated 26.06.2012 and has left the matter there.	Reasoning
It is further relevant to notice that when contempt application was filed by the respondent being Contempt Application No. 2680 of 2016, the High Court observed that there has been no adjudication by the Writ Court on the question as to whether the respondent was entitled to payment of salary for the period 2007 to 2012.	None
The observations of the Contempt Court in last two paragraph is as follows ?	None
From the materials brought on record, it transpires that there is no adjudication by the writ court on the question as to whether the applicant is entitled to payment of salary for the period 2007 to 2012, particularly as he had not worked during that period.	None
There is also no adjudication of his right to claim promotion or to receive medical bills.	None
The issues therefore as are being raised by the applicant in this petition need not be entertained by this Court, at this stage.	None
It transpires that on account of setting aside of the dismissal order the petitioner has been paid all his retiral dues.	None
Leaving it open for the applicant to seek appropriate adjudication in respect of his entitlement to receive salary for the period 2007 to 2012 as well as other benefits including promotional pay scale, medical bills and refixation of his pension, in appropriate proceedings, this contempt petition is consigned to records.?	None
It was after 15.11.2017 that Writ Petition No.61102 of 2017 was filed by the respondent.	None
Thus, in the Writ Petition No.61102 of 2017, the learned Single Judge was required to adjudicate on the entitlement of respondent for payment of salary.	None
Learned Single Judge has adjudicated with regard to entitlement of salary from 02.02.2007 to 14.05.2009 and issued directions thereunder.	Reasoning
We may notice that the Division Bench while setting aside the order dated 14.05.2009 has directed for payment of consequential benefits.	None
It is useful to extract the operative portion of the said Appellate Court judgment dated 15.02.2016, which is to the following effect ?	None
We accordingly allow the special appeal.	None
The judgment and order of the learned Single Judge dated 29 May, 2015 and 2 December, 2015 insofar as it rejects the challenge laid by the appellant to the order dated 14 May, 2009 is hereby set aside.	None
Consequently, the order dated 14 May, 2009 is also quashed.	None
The appellant shall be entitled to all consequential benefits.?	None
There is clear difference between the direction of the High Court insofar as setting aside the order dated 14.05.2009 is concerned and insofar as setting aside the order dated 26.06.2012 is concerned, whereas there is a clear direction for payment of consequential reliefs while setting aside the order dated 14.05.2009 there is no direction with regard to payment of salary while setting aside the order dated 26.06.2012, hence the question was required to be gone into by learned Single Judge while deciding the Writ Petition No.61102 of 2017.	Reasoning
We may also notice the consideration of learned Single Judge while noticing the claim of the respondent for quashing and setting aside the order dated 26.06.2012.	None
In paragraph Nos. 20 and 21, entire discussion regarding setting aside the order dated 26.06.2012 is contained, which is to the following effect ?	None
20.	None
With regard to the absence of the petitioner thereafter, the petitioner was subjected to disciplinary proceeding and a charge sheet was issued to him alleging the absence of 663 days.	None
The inquiry proceeded exparte against him and ultimately the dismissal order was passed on the ground of unauthorised absence on 26.06.2012.	None
The petitioner had in the meantime been retired on 20.06.2012 and this Court in its judgment and order dated 29.05.2015 in Writ  	None
A No. 59041 of 2014 set aside the dismissal order and the appellate order.	None
This judgment of this Court was challenged by the respondent in Special Leave Petition which was dismissed on 18.09.2015 and the judgment and order dated 29.05.2015 attained finality.	None
The respondent cannot therefore say that the petitioner was unauthorisedly absent for the said period now at this late stage.	None
The petitioner is entitled to the arrears of salary w.e.f. 14.05.2009 up to 20.06.2012, the date of his retirement, along with interest at the rate of 18 per annum from the date when it became due till the date of its actual payment.?	None
There is no adjudication regarding claim of salary or back wages to the respondent in the impugned judgment of learned Single Judge for the period 15.05.2009 to 20.06.2012.	None
Learned Single Judge was of the opinion that in view of the setting aside of the order dated 26.06.2012, payment of salary is automatic, which view of the Single Judge is not correct.	Reasoning
The present is not a case where the respondent was dismissed from the service and consequent to dismissal, he could not work and when dismissal was set aside, he will be automatically entitled for back wages.	Reasoning
We may notice some of the judgments of this Court where issue of back wages has been considered by this Court.	None
This Court in Deepali Gundu Surwase Vs.	None
Kranti Junior Adhyapak Mhavidyalaya (D.Ed.)	None
And Others, (2013) 10 SCC 324 was considering a case where the question was considered as to whether the appellant was entitled to wages for the period she was kept out of service forcibly by the management of school.	None
In paragraph No. 22, following was laid down ?	None
22.	None
The very idea of restoring an employee to the position which he held before dismissal or removal or termination of service implies that the employee will be put in the same position in which he would have been but for the illegal action taken by the employer.	None
The injury suffered by a person, who is dismissed or removed or is otherwise terminated from service cannot easily be measured in terms of money.	None
With the passing of an order which has the effect of severing the employeremployee relationship, the latter?s source of income gets dried up.	None
Not only the employee concerned, but his entire family suffers grave adversities.	None
They are deprived of the source of sustenance.	None
The children are deprived of nutritious food and all opportunities of education and advancement in life.	None
At times, the family has to borrow from the relatives and other acquaintance to avoid starvation.	None
These sufferings continue till the competent adjudicatory forum decides on the legality of the action taken by the employer.	None
The reinstatement of such an employee, which is preceded by a finding of the competent judicial quasi judicial body or court that the action taken by the employer is ultra vires the relevant statutory provisions or the principles of natural justice, entitles the employee to claim full back wages.	None
If the employer wants to deny back wages to the employee or contest his entitlement to get consequential benefits, then it is for him her to specifically plead and prove that during the intervening period the employee was gainfully employed and was getting the same emoluments.	None
The denial of back wages to an employee, who has suffered due to an illegal act of the employer would amount to indirectly punishing the employee concerned and rewarding the employer by relieving him of the obligation to pay back wages including the emoluments.?	None
We may hasten to add that present is not a case where respondent was kept away from the work on account of dismissal.	Reasoning
Admittedly, the respondent attained the age of retirement on 20.06.2012 and order terminating his services was passed only on 26.06.2012, which was rightly held to be ineffective.18.	Reasoning
We may notice another judgment of this Court in Airports Authority of India and Others Vs.	Reasoning
Shambhu Nath Das alias S.N. Das, (2008) 11 SCC 498.	Reasoning
In the above case, the respondent did not join after expiry of the leave.	Reasoning
The respondent was issued a warning that unless he joins on or before 30.10.1985, failing which it would be presumed that he had voluntarily abandoned his service with the consequence that his name would be struck off the rolls with effect from 01.11.1985.	Reasoning
The said order was challenged by the respondent and learned Sigle Judge on 10.11.1995 directed the Airports Authority of India to allow the respondent to join duty	Reasoning
but it was held that he shall not be entitled for the arrears of pay for the period he was absent.	Reasoning
The order of learned Single Judge was again challenged by the respondent without joining.	Reasoning
The Division Bench set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and remanded the matter back to the learned Single Judge.	Reasoning
Learned Single Judge directed the appellant to reinstate the respondent and further directed that insofar as the salary of the writ petitioner is concerned, during the period he stayed away from the work, Airports Authority of India, is directed to consider the matter sympathetically and, if it is permissible under its rules, allow to him half of the salary and other benefits during the period from 17.10.1985 till 10.11.1995.	Reasoning
The Airports Authority of India accepted the judgment and allowed him to join w.e.f. 01.11.1999 and passed an order on 14.05.2002 holding that the period of unauthorised absence was to be treated as diesnon and the claim for back wages was accordingly disallowed on the principle of no work no pay.	Reasoning
The order dated 14.05.2002 was once again challenged by the respondent claiming back wages, which was allowed by the learned Single Judge.	Reasoning
On further denial of claim, matter was taken by respondent to learned Single Judge to issue certain directions.	Reasoning
Against the learned Single Judge?s Order, matter was taken in appeal before Division Bench, where direction to pay 50 of back wages was issued.	Reasoning
Allowing the appeal, this Court stated following in paragraph Nos. 8 to 11 This order of the learned Single Judge has been set aside by the Division Bench vide the impugned order dated 2132007 with the observations that the order of the High Court in CR (W) No. 5715 of 1986 which had directed that the respondent be paid 50 of the back wages for the period from 17101985 to 10111995 should be complied with.9.	None
The learned counsel for the appellant has pointed out that as the respondent had not attended to his duties for almost 15 years despite having been called upon to do so repeatedly, the direction of the Division Bench to grant him back wages from 17101985 to 10111995 was clearly not justified on the principle of ?	None
no work no pay?.	Arguments of Petitioner
She has pointed out that the appellant Authority would have been fully justified even if it had dismissed the respondent from service, but on the contrary, a huge benefit had already been given to him as he had been taken back in service despite having remained absent for almost fifteen years.10.	None
The learned counsel for the respondent has, however, supported the judgment of the Division Bench.	None
We are of the opinion that in the light of the fact that the respondent did not report for duty for 15 years, there was no justification whatsoever to grant him any back wages on the general principle that nobody could be directed to claim wages for the period that he remained absent without leave or without justification.	None
We also find that the judgment dated 1381999 which had attained finality had directed as under?(a) Insofar as the salary of the writ petitioner is concerned during the period he stayed away from the work, the respondent Airports Authority of India, is directed to consider the matter sympathetically and, if it is permissible under its rules, allow to him half of the salary and other benefits.?	Reasoning
This claim was considered by the competent authority and rejected for valid reasons.	None
We are, thus, unable to endorse the High Court?s order for payment of 50 back wages for the period from 17101985 to 10111995 which are far in excess of the directions in the order dated 138 1999.	None
We accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the order of the Division Bench and restore the order of the learned Single Judge dated 1542004.?	None
This Court held that there was no justification whatsoever to grant any back wages to the respondent on the general principle that nobody could be directed to claim wages for the period that he remained absent without leave or without justification.	Reasoning
We may further notice the judgment of this Court, which has also been relied on by the respondent in his counter affidavit, i.e., judgment of this Court in Shobha Ram Raturi Vs.	None
Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited and Others (2016) 16 SCC 663).	Arguments of Respondent
In the above case, the appellant was retired from service on 31.12.2002, even though he would have, in the ordinary course, attained his date of retirement on superannuation, only on 31.12.2005.	None
The appellant assailed the order of retirement, which was allowed by learned Single Judge.	None
Learned Single Judge has denied the back wages to the appellant on the principle of ?	None
no work no pay?.	Arguments of Petitioner
The order of learned Single Judge was assailed by the appellant by filing a Letters Patent Appeal, which too was dismissed.	None
This Court allowed the appeal of the appellant and made following observations in paragraph Nos. 3 and 4 Having given our thoughtful consideration to the controversy, we are satisfied, that after the impugned order of retirement dated 31122002 was set aside, the appellant was entitled to all consequential benefits.	None
The fault lies with the respondents in not having utilised the services of the appellant for the period from 112003 to 31122005.	None
Had the appellant been allowed to continue in service, he would have readily discharged his duties.	None
Having restrained him from rendering his services with effect from 1 12003 to 31122005, the respondent cannot be allowed to press the selfserving plea of denying him wages for the period in question, on the plea of the principle of ?	None
no work no pay?.4.	Arguments of Petitioner
For the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are satisfied, that the impugned order passed by the High Court, to the limited extent of denying wages to the appellant, for the period from 112003 to 31122005 deserves to be set aside.	None
The same is accordingly hereby set aside.?	None
This Court held in the above case that having restrained the appellant from rendering his services with effect from 112003 to 31122005, the respondent cannot be allowed to press the plea of the principle of ?	None
no work no pay?	Arguments of Petitioner
for denying the wages.	None
In the above case, the appellant was restrained from working due to order of retirement dated 31.12.2002, due to which he could not work till his normal retirement.	None
When the order dated 31.12.2002 was set aside, automatically, he became entitled for back wages and the principle of ?	None
no work no pay? was not attracted.	None
In the present case, as noted above, the respondent was not kept away from work by any order of the appellant.	Reasoning
The order of termination of his services dismissal was passed on 26.06.2012, after his retirement on 20.06.2012, which in no manner prohibited the respondent from working.	Reasoning
The respondent during submission has submitted that he was illegally transferred to Branch Office, Jaunpur from Allahabad.	Reasoning
He was suffering from a disability of more than 40 and he could not have been transferred to another place.	Reasoning
There is nothing on record to indicate that transfer of respondent from Branch Office, Allahabad to Branch Office, Jaunpur was at any time set aside or withdrawn.	Reasoning
The salary upto 14.05.2009 was allowed to the respondent on account of setting aside of the order dated 14.05.2009, which was with all consequential benefits but with regard to entitlement of salary after 14.05.2009 to 20.06.2012, there has been no adjudication by the High Court, which is apparent from judgment of the High Court dated 03.07.2018, as extracted above.23.	Reasoning
Learned Single Judge having itself not determined the entitlement of respondent to receive salary after 14.05.2009 to 20.06.2012, it ought to have directed the appellant to consider the entitlement and take a decision thereon.	Reasoning
