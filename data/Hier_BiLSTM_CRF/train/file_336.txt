On 18 March 2016, a communication was addressed by the first appellant to distribution licensees and generators stating that Subject  Issue of commissioning certificate for Renewable Energy Projects.	Facts
Procurement of Renewable Energy from NonSolar RE projects, is being done by MPPMCL at preferential tariff till the issuance of bidding guidelines by Central Govt.	Facts
Control period of most of the RE tariffs is being completed by 31.03.2016 and determination of the tariff for next control period are under process.	Facts
Looking to the financial year target and change of tariff, most of RE generators are trying to commission their projects on or before 31.03.2016.	Facts
Tariff for the RE capacity commissioned on or after 01.04.2016 shall be governed by the tariff to be determined by MPERC.	Facts
Therefore, it would be appropriate that while issuing commissioning certificate for these projects (especially wind based RE projects), status of actual capacity successfully injected power into the grid should be properly checked before issuing of commissioning certificate for the project.	Facts
In view of above, a format containing the commissioning details to establish the actual injection of power into the grid by particular WTG Unit has been achieved, is enclosed.	Facts
It is requested that concerning field officers may please be instructed to provide required information in the format and submit the same with commissioning certificate for the wind projects.	Facts
Commissioning certificate for other NonSolar RE category should also be prepared in the same line with the meter reading details to establish successful power injection into the grid by the RE plants.	Facts
It may please be noted that the commissioned capacity up to 31 st March 2016 and after 31 st March 2016 will have different tariff and will be fixed for entire plant life.	Facts
Any dispute regarding commissioned capacity would yield considerable financial implications.	Facts
Therefore, to avoid any controversy, commissioning certificate should be issued with due diligence and responsibility.?	Facts
A format for the commissioning of wind power projects was annexed to the letter.11.	Facts
Essentially, the letter took notice of the fact that since the tariff was to change for projects which were commissioned on or after 1 April 2016, most generators of renewable energy were trying to commission their projects before 31 March 2016 to get the benefit of the higher tariff under the earlier Tariff Order.	Facts
Hence, it was specified that the ?status of actual capacity successfully injected power into the grid?	Facts
should be verified before issuance of the certificate of commissioning.12.	Facts
According to the appellants, the then Superintending Engineer (OM), Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitran Company Limited, which is the concerned distribution licensee, issued a certificate to the first respondent on 31 March 2016 stating that as of the date of the certificate, the project had been commissioned.	Facts
The appellants have sought to dispute the certificate on the ground that the commissioning certificate was not in accordance with the format attached with the guidelines dated 18 March 2016, according to which the actual injection of power into the grid was the relevant criterion.13.	Facts
On 1 April 2016, the first respondent addressed a letter to the first appellant seeking the execution of a Power Purchase Agreement 6 on the basis that it commissioned its project on 31 March 2016.	Facts
The appellants dispute the factual contention that the project was commissioned on 31 March 2016 and submit that the data provided by the State Load Despatch Centre 7 , which maintains accounts of energy transmission to the grid, shows that the injection of power into the grid took place for the first time on 1 April 2016.	Facts
The SLDC was requested to confirm the status of power injected into the grid in respect of the project of the first respondent on 2 April 2016.	Facts
The data furnished by SLDC and its report for active power readings from 31 March 2016 to 2 April 2016 sets out time blocks during which power flowed into the grid.	Facts
The data which has been placed on the record indicates the injection of three units in Block 1 as on 1 April 2016 and, thereafter, injection commenced with Block 8 on 2 April 2016, going up to Block 16.	Facts
Thereafter, the data indicates that there was an injection of power into the grid during the course of several blocks on 2 April 2016.	Facts
According to the appellants, on the basis of the SLDC data, power was injected into the grid on or from 1 April 2016 and not before.	Facts
In 6 ?	Facts
PPA? 7 ?	Facts
SLDC?	Facts
consequence, the first respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the unit rate of Rs 5.92 fixed under the earlier Tariff Order.14.	Facts
On 30 April 2016, the first appellant informed the first respondent that since its project had not been commissioned before 31 March 2016, it would not enter into a PPA under the earlier Tariff Order dated 26 March 2013 under which the unit price was fixed at Rs 5.92.	Facts
The letter, however, indicated that if the first respondent signified its consent by 30 May 2016, the tariff would be governed by the new Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016 for procurement of power from WEGs.	Facts
On 1 February 2017, the first appellant informed the first respondent that if it did not enter into a PPA under the subsequent Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016, which fixed the unit price for power at Rs 4.78, it would not enter into any PPA with the first respondent nor allow injection of power into the grid.15.	Facts
The first respondent filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in order to challenge the letters dated 30 April 2016 and 1 February 2017.	Facts
By a judgment and order dated 21 September 2017, the High Court allowed the writ petition and set aside the letters of the first appellant dated 30 April 2016 and 1 February 2017 and directed the first appellant to take appropriate steps in accordance with the Tariff Order dated 26 March 2013.	Facts
In other words, by and as a result of the directions of the High Court, the first appellant was required to enter into a PPA with the first respondent for the purchase of electricity at the rate of Rs 5.92 per unit.16.	Facts
After the decision of the High Court, the appellant revoked the certificate of commissioning dated 31 March 2016.17.	Facts
A review petition was filed before the High Court which was dismissed on 29 January 2018.18.	Facts
The revocation of the commissioning certificate gave rise to the institution of the second set of writ petitions in the High Court in which, by an interim order dated 15 May 2018, the revocation has been stayed.	Facts
That has given rise to two appeals before this Court.19.	Facts
Appearing on behalf of the appellants, Mr. Nitin Gaur, learned counsel submitted that The crucial provision for the application of the Tariff Order which came into force on 17 March 2016 is that it would apply to all new wind electric generation projects commissioned on or after 00.00 hrs on 1 April 2016(ii)	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants had, by the guidelines dated 18 March 2016, required the submission of data in the prescribed format to indicate the actual injection of power into the grid so as to furnish an objective basis for determining as to whether the project had been commissioned before or after the cutoff prescribed(iii)	Arguments of Petitioner
As a result of the data which was obtained from the SLDC, it has emerged that the actual injection of power into the grid took place on 1 April 2016(iv)	Arguments of Petitioner
In consequence, the first appellant offered to the first respondent that it was ready and willing to execute a PPA in terms of the new Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016 which was applicable to projects which had been commissioned on or after 1 April 2016(v)	Arguments of Petitioner
The first respondent failed to take the benefit of the offer which was made by the first appellant and instead pursued its writ petition before the High Court(vi)	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court has erred in relying on the commissioning certificate issued by the Superintending Engineer, ignoring that the certificate was not in accordance with the format in which data was required by the first appellant for the purpose of establishing the actual commissioning of the project before 31 March 2016(vii)	Arguments of Petitioner
As a result of the subsequent developments, the first appellant is now bound by the guidelines which have been issued by the State of Madhya Pradesh on 1 August 2014.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, under the guidelines formulated by the Union Ministry of Power in the Government of India on 8 December 2017, the first appellant is required to pursue a competitive bidding process for the purpose of entering into a PPA(viii) As a result of the PPAs which have been entered into by the first appellant following the competitive bidding process, it has been able to secure electric power at cheaper rates ranging between Rs 2.30 to Rs 2.59 per unit and(ix)	Arguments of Petitioner
The first appellant would now be willing to enter into a PPA on the basis of competitive bidding and having due regard to the interests of the consumers, it would be appropriate if the first respondent is directed to do so.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, it has been urged on behalf of the first respondent in the appeals by Mr Vivek K Tankha and Mr Gopal Sankaranarayanan, learned senior counsel, that Under the terms of the earlier Tariff Order which held the field for the period 201316, a rate of Rs 5.92 per unit was prescribed for all new wind generating units, which had been commissioned until 31 March 2016(ii)	Arguments of Respondent
The rate of Rs 5.92 per unit was to remain frozen for a life cycle of 25 years(iii)	Arguments of Respondent
In the present case, in terms of the Tariff Order, which referred to the successful commissioning of the project, the first respondent commissioned its project on 31 March 2016 as evidenced by the certificate issued by the Superintending Engineer(iv)	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court has not erred in directing the appellants to act on the basis of the certificate of commissioning and in staying the revocation which was issued only on 17 November 2017 after the writ petition was decided(v)	Arguments of Respondent
In the alternative, and without prejudice to the above submissions, in any event, there is no justification on the part of the first appellant not to enter into a PPA with the first respondent on the basis of the Tariff Order which was notified on 17 March 2016 for the control period 201619(vi)	Arguments of Respondent
The notification of the Union of India dated 8 December 2017 has no application since it applies to projects having an individual size of 5 MW and above at one site with a minimum bid capacity of 25 MW for intraState projects.(vii)	Arguments of Respondent
The revocation of the commissioning certificate was a unilateral act of the first appellant without allowing an opportunity of being heard to the first respondent and no show cause notice was issued.	Arguments of Respondent
The Tariff Order of March 2013 stipulated that it would be applicable to all new wind electric generation projects which were commissioned on or after 1 April 2013 for the sale of electricity to distribution licensees in the State.	Arguments of Petitioner
The control period of the Tariff Order commenced on 1 April 2013 and would end on 31 March 2016.	None
The Tariff Order fixed a levelized tariff of Rs 5.92 per unit for new wind energy projects to be commissioned after the issuance of the Order for a project life of 25 years.	Facts
Para 12.30 provided that all existing projects which were commissioned before 1 April 2013 would be governed by the terms and conditions applicable at the time of commissioning.	Facts
Hence, the crucial ingredient in determining the tariff was the actual date on which the project was commissioned.22.	None
The Tariff Order of 17 March 2016 which replaced the earlier Tariff Order applied to all new wind electric generation projects which were commissioned at 00.00 hrs on 1 April 2016 or thereafter.	Arguments of Petitioner
The SLDC was required by Para 4.2 of the Tariff Order to submit a list of WEGs commissioned during the month of March 2016 from 00.00 hrs of 1 March 2016 to 24.00 hrs of 31 March 2016.	None
This data was sought in order to provide an objective basis of determining whether a project had been commissioned before the new Tariff Order became applicable to projects which were commissioned with effect from 1 April 2016.23.	None
In line with the above provisions, the guidelines that were issued by the first appellant on 18 March 2016 provided a format for the issuance of commissioning certificates.	Reasoning
The format required readings of (i) WTG meters (ii) main billing meters and (iii) check billing meters.	Reasoning
The format required the submission of this data in order to establish the date on which a particular project had been commissioned.	Reasoning
The actual date of commissioning would determine the applicable tariff the tariff of Rs 5.92 per unit would apply to projects which were commissioned on or before 31 March 2016, while the new rate of Rs 4.78 per unit would apply to projects which were commissioned on or after 1 April 2016.	Reasoning
Requiring the SLDC to submit data of the actual injection of power into the grid was with the objective of establishing the actual commissioning of the project.24.	Reasoning
In the present case, the principal submission of the appellants is that the data which was furnished by the SLDC indicates that the actual injection of power into the grid by the first respondent took place on 1 April 2016.	Reasoning
It is on that basis that the first appellant has submitted that the commissioning certificate was not in accordance with the prescribed format and had to be revoked.	Reasoning
Before this Court, the data which has been furnished by the SLDC is not in dispute.	Reasoning
Indeed, that is the basis on which Mr Vivek K Tankha, learned senior counsel urged his alternative submission that in any event, even going by the SLDC data, it is evident that the power was injected into the grid on and from 1 April 2016.25.	Reasoning
On reviewing the docmentary material on the record, we are not prepared to accept the view which has weighed with the High Court, namely, that the commissioning of the project was completed by 31 March 2016.	Reasoning
The certificate of commissioning which has been issued by the Superintending Engineer is belied by the objective factual data available from the SLDC which is a statutory body constituted under Section 31 of the Act.	Reasoning
The objective data on the record indicates that the injection of power into the grid took place on 1 April 2016.	Reasoning
Hence, we are of the view that this should be the basis on which the claim for the entering into a PPA should be founded.26.	Reasoning
Since the factual data has been placed before this Court, we are of the view that the project of the first respondent was commissioned on 1 April 2016 since the SLDC data indicates the injection of power into the grid with effect from that date.	Reasoning
On the basis of the commissioning of the project on 1 April 2016, we find merit in the alternative submission which has been urged on behalf of the first respondent in the appeals that the Tariff Order that must apply is the Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016.	Reasoning
The first respondent was before the Madhya Pradesh High Court in writ proceedings espousing its claim to the benefit of a higher rate of Rs 5.92 per unit on the basis of the earlier Tariff Order and on the basis that the commissioning of its project had taken place on 31 March 2016.	Reasoning
The first respondent was bona fide pursuing its claim in that regard which found acceptance in the impugned judgment and order of the High Court.	Reasoning
Though we have differed with the view which has been taken by the High Court, we are of the view that it would be unfair to deny to the first respondent the benefit of the rate which came to be prescribed by the Tariff Order of 17 March 2016.	Reasoning
The rate which was prescribed by that Tariff Order of Rs 4.78 per unit was to apply during the control period beginning from 1 April 2016 and ending on 31 March 2019 and that rate would continue to govern the life cycle of 25 years, as prescribed by Para 5 of the Tariff Order.	Reasoning
The first respondent cannot be denied a parity of treatment, as has been allowed to other projects of a similar nature which would be governed by the control period stipulated in Para 5 of the Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016.27.	Reasoning
The competitive bidding guidelines upon which reliance has been placed by Mr Nitin Gaur, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants, were formulated by the Union Ministry of Power subsequently on 8 December 2017.	Reasoning
Moreover, Para 3.1 of those guidelines is not applicable to the project of the first respondent.	Reasoning
Para 3.1 provides thus ?	None
3.	None
APPLICABILITY OF GUIDELINES3.1 These Guidelines are being issued under the provisions of Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 for longterm procurement of electricity through competitive bidding process, by the Procurer(s)?, from gridconnected Wind Power Projects (WPP?)	Reasoning
having, (a) individual size of 5 MW and above at one site with minimum bid capacity of 25 MW for intrastate projects and (b) individual size of 50 MW and above at one site with minimum bid capacity of 50 MW for interstate projects.?	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied)	None
The above guidelines apply to gridconnected Wind Power Projects with an individual size of 5 MW and above at one site with a minimum bid capacity of 25 MW for intraState projects.	Reasoning
Since the first respondent is admittedly an intraState project and does not fulfil the above requirement, the guidelines (which in any event came into force subsequently) will have no application.29.	Reasoning
For the above reasons, we allow the appeals in part and set aside the impugned judgments and orders of the High Court dated 21 September 2017 and 29 January 2018.	Decision
We direct, in consequence of the above discussion, that the first respondent in the appeals shall be entitled to the benefit of the Tariff Order dated 17 March 2016.	Decision
The appellants shall process the application of the first respondent in the appeals for execution of a PPA on that basis with effect from 1 April 2016.	Decision
In the view which we have taken, the second writ petition which has been filed by the first respondent before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh shall not survive and shall stand disposed of in terms of the present judgment.	Decision
There shall be no order as to costs.30.	Decision
Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.	Decision
