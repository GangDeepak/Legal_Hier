Facts
As the properties which had been sold by Venkata Lakshamamma to the appellant Kuppala Obul Reddy, had earlier been sold by her husband Yella Reddy to the respondent Bonala Venpata Narayana Reddy, since deceased, disputes naturally arose between Kuppala Obul Reddy and Venpata Narayana Reddy with regard to ownership and possession of these properties.	Facts
Kuppala Obul Reddy, the vendee from the wife Venkata Lakshamamma, filed a suit in the District Munsiffs Court, Cuddapah being Suit No. 415 of 1963.	Facts
This suit filed by Kuppala Obul Reddy proceeded on the basis that he was the owner in possession of the properties as purchaser of the properties from Venkata Lakshamamma and Venpata Narayana Reddy, an influential person, was trying to interfere with his right, title, interest and possession in the property and he prayed for a permanent injunction restraining Venpata Narayana Reddy, the defendant in the suit, and his men and all those claiming under him from interfering with the possession and enjoyment of properties in Schedule B of the plaint.	Facts
In the written statement filed by Venpata Narayana Reddy, the defendant in the suit, the title of the plaintiff Kuppala Obul Reddy in the suit properties and his possession thereof were disputed.	Facts
It was pleaded by the defendant Venpata Narayana Reddy that he had purchased the properties from yella Reddy who was the owner of the properties and Venkata Lakshamamma, the wife who had left the husband, had illegally and collusively transferred the properties to the plaintiff.	Facts
The plea of the defendant was that the plaintiff was neither the owner nor in possession of the properties.	Facts
In the suit before the Munsiff evidence, oral and documentary, had been led.	Facts
The wife Venkata Lakshamamma gave evidence on behalf of the defendant.	Facts

Whether the plaintiff has title to and possession of the suit property within the statutory period.(3) Whether the saledeed in favour of the plaintiff is a nominal transaction not supported by any consideration ?	Facts
(4) Whether the exchangedeed is true, valid and binding on the defendants vendor?(5) To what relief, is the plaintiff entitled?On a consideration of the entire evidence, the learned Munsiff decreed the suit with costs in favour of the plaintiff.7.	None
The defendant filed an appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the learned Munsiff in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Cuddapah.	Facts
The learned Subordinate Judge allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit mainly on the basis of his findings that Naramma who made the gift of properties to Venkata Lakshamamma did not have any title to the properties and the gift by Naramma in favour of Venkata Lakshamamma was not valid and as Venkata lakshamamma did not have any title to the properties sold by her to the plaintiff, the plaintiff acquired not title to the properties.8.	Facts
Against the judgment and decree passed by the Subordinate Judge on March 21, 1967, the plaintiff Kuppala Obul Reddy preferred an appeal to the Andhra Pradesh High Court.	Facts
The High Court by its judgment and order dated March 31, 1969 directed the Lower Appellate Court to submit fresh findings on the following two points on the basis of the evidence already on record (i) Whether the deed of exchange Ex.	None
A5 was nominal and not acted upon as contended by the defendant, and(ii) Whether the plaintiff was in possession of the B Schedule property on the date of the suit ?	None
Pursuant to the order and directions given by the High Court, the Lower Appellate Court on consideration of the entire evidence on record held on point No. 1 Under these circumstances in my opinion, it can be said that the exchange deed, the original of Ex.	Facts
A5 was acted upon by the parties to the document and I decide the point accordingly.	None
The Lower Appellate Court on second point held Under these circumstances the plaintiffs possession over the suit lands on the date of suit is established.	Facts
Hence I decide the point No. 2 accordingly.	Facts
The learned Subordinate Judge duly forwarded the aforesaid findings to the High Court by his report dated July 14, 1969.9.	Facts
The High Court by its judgment dated September 3, 1969 dismissed the appeal of the plaintiff.	Facts
The High Court held that Venkata Lakshamamma did not get any title to the property and Yella Reddy became entitled to the entire properties and the deed of exchange between the husband and the wife was not of any material consequence.10.	Facts
The correctness of the decision of the High Court has been challenged in this appeal by the plaintiff with special leave granted by this Court.	Issue
During the pendency of the appeal the original defendant Venpata Narayana Reddy died and his heirs and legal representatives who have been brought on record, have contested this appeal.11.	Issue
The unfortunate dispute between the husband and the wife has resulted in this long drawn dispute between the parties.12.	None
The real question which requires consideration in this appeal is whether the gift by Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma was valid and whether Naramma acquired title to the properties gifted to her under the said deed.	Issue
The High Court appears to have held that all the properties gifted by Thimma Reddy were joint family properties and the gift by him in favour of his wife Naramma was not valid.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court further appears to have approved of the finding of the Lower Appellate Court that the deed of gift executed by Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma should be regarded as a conveyance of Thimma Reddys share in favour of his son Yella Reddy.	None
The High Court in its judgment dated March 31, 1969 has held But the learned Judge has not satisfactorily considered the effect of the subsequent exchange deed, Ex. A5.	None
In the trial court, there is a separate issue on the question whether the exchange deed is nominal.	None
The trial court, on thorough consideration of the entire evidence in the case including the recitals in the exchange deed and other evidence of possession, held that the deed of exchange was acted upon between the parties and that as a result of the exchange transaction, Yella Reddys wife became entitled to the suit B Schedule property which she sold to the plaintiff.	None
A reading of the judgment of the Lower Appellate Court shows that the learned Judge has not given due consideration to the finding relating to the truth of the exchange transaction.	None
It is therefore necessary that there should be a raised finding on the question covered by issue No. 4.	None
I therefore direct the Lower Appellate Court to submit fresh findings on the following points (i) Whether the deed of exchange Ex.	None
A5 was nominal and not acted upon as contended by the defendant and(ii) Whether the plaintiff was in possession of the B Schedule property on the date of the suit.	None
Notwithstanding the aforesaid findings, the High Court however had remanded the matter to the Lower Appellate Court on the questions noted below, as the High Court was of the opinion that the Lower Appellate Court had not given due consideration to the deed of exchange executed by and between Yella Reddy and his wife Venkata Lakshamamma and also the question of possession (i) Whether the deed of exchange Ex.	None
A5 was nominal and not acted upon as contended by the defendant and(ii) Whether the plaintiff was in possession of the B Schedule property on the date of the suit?Though the Lower Appellate Court after remand had found in favour of the appellant on both these points, yet the High Court mainly on the basis of the view earlier expressed by the High Court in the first judgment dismissed the appeal, ignoring the findings of the Lower Appellate Court on these two points and without attaching any importance to the same.13.	None
The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant has raised the following principal contentions 1.	Arguments of Petitioner
The approach of the Lower Appellate Court and of the High Court in considering the issues involved in the suit was wrong and erroneous.2.	None
There was no pleading that the properties covered by the deed of gift executed by Thimma Reddy in favour of wife Naramma were joint family properties and no issue as to the properties being joint family properties was raised in the suit.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the absence of any pleadings and any issue there could be no finding that the properties were joint family properties.3.	Arguments of Petitioner
There may be a presumption in Hindu Law that there was a joint family but there could be no presumption that the properties were joint family properties.4.	Arguments of Petitioner
The findings of the Lower Appellate Court which was approved by the High Court that the gift executed in favour of his wife Naramma was for the benefit of Yella Reddy and the construction put on the deed of gift to the effect that the deed created a beneficial interest in favour of the son Yella Reddy and was in the nature of a conveyance of the half share of Thimma Reddys properties in favour of his son who became owner of the said properties, were clearly erroneous and unwarranted on the facts and in law.5.	Arguments of Petitioner
The deed of exchange executed by and between Yella Reddy and his wife Venkata Lakshamamma clearly established that Yella Reddy had accepted the gift made by his father in favour of his mother and the gift executed by his mother in favour of his wife and had acted on the same.	Arguments of Petitioner
Yella Reddy in view of his conduct was clearly estopped from questioning the validity of the gift by his mother in favour of his wife and the respondent who seeks to derive his title from Yella Reddy must be held to be estopped.6.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court clearly erred in ignoring the finding of the Lower Appellate Court made after remand on the question of the deed of exchange being acted upon between the parties and also on the question of possession of the properties.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court should have held that the deed of exchange and the conduct of the parties clearly established that the properties gifted by Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma were not joint family properties and the deed of gift in favour of Naramma was valid.14.	Arguments of Petitioner
In answer to the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that as there was a joint family, the finding that the properties were joint family properties should be held to be correct and in that view of the matter the gift by the husband Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma must be held to be invalid.	Arguments of Respondent
It is his submission that as the gift by Thimma Reddy in favour of Naramma was not valid, there could be no valid gift of the properties by Naramma to Venkata Lakshamamma and she acquired no title to the properties.	Arguments of Respondent
He, therefore, contends that as Venkata Lakshamamma did not acquire any title to the properties, the deed of exchange cannot have the effect of creating or conferring any title of the said properties on Venkata Lakshamamma.	Arguments of Respondent
He has further argued that on a proper construction of the gift deed executed by Thimma Reddy in favour of Naramma, the said deed was really in the nature of trust for the benefit of Yella Reddy and Naramma had no right to make any gift of those properties to Venkata Lakshamamma.15.	Arguments of Respondent
We find considerable force in the submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellant.	Reasoning
No case is made out in the pleadings with regard to the properties gifted by Thimma Reddy to his wife Naramma being joint family properties.	Reasoning
No issue with regard to the properties being joint family properties was raised and no such issue could possibly have been raised in the absence of any pleading.	Reasoning
The evidence of Yella Reddy in the suit does not mention that the properties gifted by his father to his mother under the deed of gift belonged to the joint family.	Reasoning
In the absence of any pleading and any issue and further in the absence of any proper evidence, the view expressed by the learned Judge of the High Court that the properties were joint family properties is clearly unwarranted.	Reasoning
There may be presumption that there is a Hindu joint family but there can be no presumption that the joint family possesses joint family properties.	Reasoning
The findings of the Lower Appellate Court that the deed of gift executed by Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma should be regarded as conveyance of the fathers half share in favour of the son who is also entitled to half share of A Schedule properties accepted and approved by the High Court in its judgment is clearly erroneous.	Reasoning
It is indeed difficult to understand and appreciate how the Lower Appellate Court and the High Court could construe a clear deed of gift by Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma to be a conveyance of half share of Thimma Reddy in favour of his son Yella Reddy.	Reasoning
The conduct of Yella Reddy in entering into the deed of exchange with his wife Venkata Lakshamamma furnishes clear proof that the properties were not joint family properties and that the gift executed by his father Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma and the gift executed by Naramma in favour of her granddaughter and also daughterinlaw Venkata Lakshamamma, the wife of Yella Reddy with whom she entered into an exchange deed, were valid and Venkata lakshamamma had acquired title to the properties gifted to her by Naramma.	Reasoning
The clear findings recorded by the Lower Appellate Court after the further hearing on the basis of the order of remand of High Court are that the deed of exchange had in fact, been acted upon and on the basis of the deed of exchange parties had taken possession and Venkata Lakshamamma remained in possession of the remaining properties after execution of the deed of exchange and also came into possession of the portion of the house which was allotted to her as a result of the exchange between herself and her husband Yella Reddy.	Reasoning
These clear findings went unchallenged and were final.	Reasoning
The High Court went wrong in ignoring these findings on the ground that by mere recognition Venkata Lakshamamma did not get any title to the property and the mere fact that the parties were under the impression that the properties belonged to Venkata Lakshamamma could not confer upon her any title under the law.	Reasoning
Apart from the question that there were no pleadings as to the properties being joint family properties and no issue as to joint family had been raised and there was no proper evidence to make out any case of the properties being joint family properties, the High Court should have appreciated that the deed of exchange by and between Yella Reddy and his wife Venkata Lakshamamma which was acted upon between the parties established that the properties could not be and were not joint family properties.16.	Reasoning
We have earlier set out the deed of gift executed by Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma.	Reasoning
The document clearly establishes that the properties were gifted by Thimma Reddy to his wife Naramma absolutely.	Reasoning
This document cannot be interpreted to construe a trust in favour of Yella Reddy and cannot be construed by any process of construction to be a conveyance in respect of the donors half share to the son Yella Reddy.	Reasoning
The mere reference to the son in the recital of the document does not indicate any intention of creating any trust or of making any conveyance of the properties in favour of the son.	Reasoning
The recital only indicates that as Naramma was complaining that her husband Thimma Reddy who had taken a second wife was showing greater affection for the second wife and as Naramma who had a son wanted to be suitably provided, the deed of gift was was being executed by Thimma Reddy.	Reasoning
The recital only indicates the circumstances which prompted Thimma Reddy to execute the deed of gift.	Reasoning
The document clearly and unequivocally shows that this was a deed of gift in favour of the wife and by the document the properties mentioned in the deed of gift were being given to Naramma absolutely.	Reasoning
We have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the deed of gift executed by Thimma Reddy in favour of his wife Naramma was a valid deed of gift and under this deed of gift Naramma acquired full and complete title to the properties mentioned in the deed of gift.	Reasoning
As Naramma had perfect title in the properties gifted to her by her husband and she was the full owner of the said properties, she was perfectly competent to make gift of the said properties to her granddaughter who also happened to be her daughterinlaw, Venkata Lakshamamma.	Reasoning
The facts and circumstances of the case indicate that Yella Reddy was frittering away the various other properties which had come to him from his father and were also not pulling on very well with his wife Venkata Lakshamamma who was also the granddaughter of Naramma (daughters daughter), Naramma wanted suitable provision to be made for Venkata Lakshamamma.	Reasoning
Venkata Lakshamamma, therefor, became complete owner of the properties gifted to her by Naramma and as full owner of the properties she was free to deal with and dispose of the same in any manner she chose.	Reasoning
Asserting and exercising her right of ownership she had executed the deed of exchange with her husband, transferring part of the properties for obtaining the portion of the house from her husband and retaining the other properties which she subsequently sold to the appellant.	Reasoning
Venkata Lakshamamma as true owner of the properties for obtaining the portion of the house from her husband and retaining by her out of the properties gifted to her by Naramma after transferring a portion thereof to the husband in exchange of the portion of the house, could and did validly sell the remaining properties to the appellant and the appellant, therefore, acquired proper title to the properties which were sold to him by Venkata Lakshamamma and which were mentioned in Schedule B to the plaint.	Reasoning
As in our view Venkata Lakshamamma had proper title to the properties which she could and did lawfully and validly transfer to the appellant by the saledeed executed by her in favour of the appellant, the appellant and acquired proper title to these properties and had become the lawful owner thereof.	Reasoning
In that view of the matter it does not become necessary for us to consider whether Yella Reddy by entering into the deed of exchange became estopped from challenging the validity of the title of his wife Venkata Lakshamamma and the respondent who seeks to drive title from Yella Reddy, is also so estopped.17.	Reasoning
The appeal, therefore, succeeds.	Decision
The judgments of the Lower Appellate Court and of the High Court are set aside and the judgment of the Munsiff dated April 23, 1965 decreeing the suit of the plaintiff, the appellant before us, is restored.	Decision
In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, and taking into consideration that the parties were driven to this litigation because of the dispute between the husband and the wife and the further fact that the original defendant is dead and is now being represented by his legal representatives we propose to make no order as to cost and we direct that parties will pay and bear their own costs throughout irrespective of any order of costs passed by any court.	Decision
