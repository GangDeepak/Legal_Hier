SUNGROUP contends that the sale price at which Items 17, 19 and 20 were sold to WINSOME was very low.	Arguments of Petitioner
It relied on the minutes of the meeting dated 28.7.2004 of the Sale Committee to get a fair indication of the market value.	Arguments of Petitioner
It pointed out that the Sale Committee had expressed the view that the price should be Rs. 5 crores for item Nos. 17, 18, 19 and 20 which would mean that the market price of item no. 17 (B77, Mohali Industrial Area, PhaseVII) was at least Rs. 4.5 crores.	Arguments of Petitioner
It, therefore, contended that the price of Rs. 3.16 crores realized for Item No. 17 very low.	Arguments of Petitioner
SUNGROUP next submitted that the adjoining plot of equal dimension (that is Plot No. B76  lot No. 10) was purchased by SUNGROUP on 20.4.2006 for a price of Rs. 11.6 crores and that if the price for Item No. 17 is worked back on that basis by deducting the annual appreciation for two years at the rate of about 15 to 20 per year, the price of item no. 17 would have been around not less than Rs. 6 to 7 crores, in the year 2004.	Arguments of Petitioner
It also alleged that one of the bidders at the interse bidding on 10.12.2004, namely Star Point Financial Services Ltd., was a sister company of WINSOME and therefore the sale was not legal.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Employees Union adopted the contentions urged by SUNGROUP and in addition submitted that notice should have been issued by the Company Court to it before confirming the sale in favour of WINSOME as the employees were vitally interested in the outcome of the sale.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Employees Union also submitted that large amounts were due to the employees and unless a good price was received, the employees would be adversely affected.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further contended that learned Company Judge, being the custodian of the assets of the company under liquidation, had tried, by its order dated 30.3.2005, to ensure that the maximum price was secured for the assets and therefore the Division Bench ought not to have interfered with the said order of the Company Judge setting aside the sale in favour of WINSOME.	Arguments of Petitioner
It also submitted that if SUNGROUP is permitted to take Item No. 17 at Rs. 11.6 crores, the price at which SUNGROUP had purchased the adjoining property (Item No. 10), it will benefit the workers and creditors of the Company.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand WINSOME contended that they had purchased Items 17, 19 and 20 at the then prevailing market price.	Arguments of Respondent
WINSOME pointed out that in spite of wide publicity, there were no better offers and the Sale Committee at its meeting held on 27.7.2004 had proposed to accept its bid of Rs. 3.14 crores.	Arguments of Respondent
Referring to the minutes of the meeting of the Sale Committee on 28.7.2004, it was submitted that the Committee had merely suggested the WINSOME should be requested to purchase Item Nos. 17 to 20, which included the machinery for which it had not made any offer for Rs. 5 crores, making it clear that it was only an asking price, open to negotiations.	Arguments of Respondent
It is contended that the sum of Rs. 5 crores referred to by the Sale Committee was not an indication of the market price of Item No.17 as Rs. 4.5 crores but only an attempt by the creditor banks to maximize the sale price receivable for Items 18 to 20.	Arguments of Respondent
Strong reliance was also placed on the fact that SUNGROUP itself had offered only Rs. 3.53 crores for Item No. 17 in February, 2005, when it sought the setting aside of the sale in favour of WINSOME which showed that the price was only around Rs. 3 crores when it made its offer in July, 2004.	Arguments of Respondent
It is contended that as there were no irregularities in the sale, the sale could not be set aside even if for any reason, the price paid by it is held to be marginally lower than the then prevailing market price.	Arguments of Respondent
Insofar as the purchase of the adjoining plot by SUNGROUP on 20.4.2006 for Rs. 11.6 crores, it was contended that the said sale was nearly 21 months after the sale of item no.	Arguments of Respondent
17 and therefore, could not be a yardstick for determining whether the sale price paid for item no.	Arguments of Respondent
17 was proper and reasonable, particularly as there was an enorhous spurt in prices after it purchased the plot.	Arguments of Respondent
Lastly it is contended that the sale having been confirmed and the PSIEC having executed the registered lease deed in their favour the question of interfering with the sale does not arise.	Arguments of Respondent
After the matter was argued for sometime the learned counsel for SUNGROUP submitted that having purchased the adjoining property, they were interested in purchasing Plot No.	None
B77 also and SUNGROUP was willing to offer the same price of Rs. 11.6 crores for the property (Item No. 17).	None
Learned counsel for the Employees Union submitted that in the interest of workers, WINSOME should take a reasonable profit and give up the property in favour of SUNGROUP so that the workers and creditors will be benefited.	Arguments of Petitioner
At this stage, learned counsel for SUNGROUP stated that being interested in the welfare of the workers, in addition to the price of Rs. 11.6 crores offered by them for Item No. 17, it will also pay ex gratia, a sum of Rs. 50 lakhs to the employees of PUNWIRE, as they have been without salary for quite sometime.	Reasoning
In view of these submissions, we queried the learned counsel for WINSOME as to whether WINSOME was interested in considering the offer of SUNGROUP.	None
Learned counsel for WINSOME took time and after obtaining instructions, submitted, though with some reluctance, that WINSOME was agreeable for the proposal, provided it received a sum of Rs. 6.36 crores for items 17, 19, 20 (made up of Rs. 3.36 crores towards the refund of price and Rs. 3 crores towards interest, expenses and compensation for deprivation of its property.	Reasoning
He submitted that WINSOME had taken a great risk by borrowing huge amounts from the banks for purchasing the property and that a sum of Rs. 1.64 crores is due to Canara Bank and Rs. 1.38 crores is due to the State Bank of Patiala (respondent 4 6 herein).	Reasoning
He also submitted that subject to payment of Rs. 6.36 crores, WINSOME had no objection either for transfer of its rights to SUNGROUP, or for the sale in its favour being set aside and a fresh sale being confirmed in favour of SUNGROUP.	Reasoning
There was on objection to the proposal by the other parties, obviously having regard to the fact that everyone is benefited by the said arrangement.	None
In view of the above we consider it a fit case to exercise our power under Art.	None
142 of the Constitution, and accept the settlement as proposed in the large interest of parties and to benefit the workmen.	Reasoning
We make it clear that the sale which has already been confirmed in favour of WINSOME is set aside, not on merits, but in pursuance of the negotiated settlement arrived at among SUNGROUP, the Employees Union and WINSOME.	Reasoning
