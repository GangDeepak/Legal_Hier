 Heard learned counsel for the parties.2.	None
These appeals have been preferred by the land owners for enhancement of compensation aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the High Court.3.	Issue
The land acquisition has been made in two villages, namely, Machhi Joan and Alladad Chak, Tehsil Sultanpur, Lodhi, Distt.	Facts
Kapurthala, Punjab.	Facts
In all 67 acres of land had been acquired in a single block.	Facts
Notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 had been issued on 11.08.2000 and the Land Acquisition Collector determined the compensation by award dated 05.12.2001	Facts

On a reference being made, the Reference Court did not enhance the compensation.	Facts
Aggrieved thereby, the land owners preferred appeals in the High Court.	Facts
The High Court by the impugned order has determined the compensation for village Alladad Chak at the rate of Rs. 8,20,000/ per acre and for the land situated in village Machhi Joan at the rate of Rs. 6,26,000/ per acre has been determined without applying the belting system.	Facts
Dissatisfied therewith appeals have been filed by land owners for enhancement of compensation.5.	Facts
It was urged by learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the compensation deserved to be enhanced for village Alladad Chak and Machhi Joan considering the exemplar evidence on record and that lot of development in the area has taken place, the compensation awarded is inadequate.	Arguments of Petitioner
The land was capable of being used for residential purpose and it was acquired for the purpose of housing.	Arguments of Petitioner
That is also an indicator for the potential value of the land.	Arguments of Petitioner
There was no rhyme or reason for differentiation of the value determined for the land in village Alladad Chak and village Machhi Joan.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. R.L. Batra, learned senior counsel has also urged that if determination is made on the strength of comparative exemplar of sale deed P25, an increase of at least 15 ought to have been granted that too on cumulative basis.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court has erred in not taking into consideration the other comparative exemplars submitted in evidence and the compensation determined is inadequate and the same deserves to be suitably enhanced.6.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mrs. Rachana Joshi Issar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent has contended that compensation granted by the High Court is already on the higher side.	Arguments of Respondent
The land was having no potential value.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court has looked into the fact that the land used to be flooded with water and was not capable of any use whatsoever and for the two different villages the same exemplar could not be applied keeping in view the value of the land was different.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also submitted that the land revenue of the land for the village Machhi Jaon was lesser as compared to that of land of village Alladad Chak.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, no case for further enhancement was made out in these appeals.7.	Arguments of Respondent
After considering the evidence on records, in particular, comparative sale exemplars, evidence adduced on behalf of the land owners the sale deeds, Exhibit PA and A3, have to be excluded from consideration as they were post Section 4 notification.	None
Notification under Section 4 was issued on 11th August, 2000 whereas these sale deeds were executed on 4th May, 2001.	None
The other exemplar on record, Exhibit A4, reflect the price of approximately Rs.	None
13,60,000/ executed on 19th May, 1996 it was for small area of 10 marlas.	None
Obviously, sale being of small piece of land, it was for residential or commercial purpose.	Reasoning
Exhibit A5, sale deed was executed on 29th July, 1999, the land was sold at the rate of Rs.	Reasoning
16,00,000/ per acre.	Reasoning
Exhibit P11 sale deed dated 19th March, 1999 related to sale of land of one kanal at the rate of Rs.	None
20,00,000/ per acre Exhibit P12 sale deed dated 14th September, 1996 was for one marla of land at the rate of Rs.	Reasoning
1,12,00,000/.	None
Exhibit A4 and A5 were not taken into consideration by the High Court as they were for very small area related to sale of plot for residential commercial purpose.8.	None
We have another examplar in the form of Exhibit P25 which had been taken into consideration by the High Court.	Reasoning
It evinces the price of 16 kanal of land at the value of Rs.	Reasoning
16,40,000/ by which amount comes to Rs. 8,40,000/ per acre.	None
The High Court has observed that 20 of the amount was required to be deducted in the facts and circumstances of the case towards development.	Reasoning
If we deduct 20 of the amount out of the said figure, the amount would come to Rs.	Reasoning
6,56,000/(Rs.8,40,000Rs.1,64,000 Rs. 6,76,000/).	None
Now, if we grant 15 increase for three years as the sale deed was executed on 3rd September, 1997 and acquisition had been made after three years on 11.08.2000, considering the evidence available in this case of escalation of price the amount would come to Rs. 9,71,400/	Reasoning
the same is rounded off to L9,72,000/ (Rupees Nine Lakhs Seventy Two Thousand only).	None
That we award with statutory benefits for Alladad Chak.9.	Reasoning
Coming to the village Machhi Joan it is apparent that land has been acquired for housing purpose under the same notification as a single block land of village Alladad Chak and Machhi Joan is adjacent, the sale deed Exhibit P25 is the land adjacent to the area that has been acquired of village Alladad Chak.	Reasoning
It would not be appropriate to take into consideration the exemplar carrying lesser value of village Machhi Jaon but to adopt the same exemplar for village Aladad Chak Exhibit P25 of as that is adjacent and forms part of single block and that has been adopted for determination of the compensation for Alladad Chak.	Reasoning
Thus, as the land had been acquired in a single block for the housing purpose and potentiality of the land of both villages is apparently similar, we award the compensation determined for village Alladed Chak to the land acquired at Machi Jaon village also, alongwith all statutory benefits as envisaged under the Act.10.	Reasoning
The appeals, are allowed to the aforesaid extent.11.	None
No order as to costs.	None
