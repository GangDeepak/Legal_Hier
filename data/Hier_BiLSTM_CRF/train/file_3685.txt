 Sarkar, J.1.	None
The appellant is a company carrying on business as supplier of electricity in a certain area in the State of Bombay.	Issue
The respondents Bathena and Tendulkar were consumers of electrical energy supplied by the appellant.	Issue
The present appeals arise out of disputes between these consumers and the appellant concerning the legality of the charges made by the appellant for electricity supplied by it.2.	Issue
The supply of electrical energy is controlled by two statutes and the questions involved in the present cases will turn on them.	Facts
These statutes are Electricity Act, 1910 and the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948.	Facts
I will first consider the Act of 1910.	Facts
Section 3 of this Act gives power to the Government to grant a licence to a party to supply electrical energy in any specified area and to prescribe in the licence the limits of price to be charged by it for the supply.	Facts
This section further provides that the provisions in the Schedule to the Act would, unless otherwise directed, be deemed, to be incorporated in the licence.	Facts
Paragraph XI of that Schedule states that a licensee would not be entitled to exceed the limits of price fixed in his licence.	Facts
This paragraph, however, gives power to the Government to alter these limits on the recommendation of an Advisory Board appointed under S. 35 of the Act.	Facts
It is not necessary to refer to the other provisions of this Act.3.	Facts
The appellant had been supplying electricity under a licence issued in 1932 by the Government of Bombay under the Act of 1910.	Facts
The licence fixed the limits of the prices which the appellant could charge but these limits were altered by an order made by the Government on December 30, 1942 under paragraph XI of the Schedule and stood thereafter as followsA. For lights and fans annas /5/ (31 nP.) per unit and,B. For motive power.	Facts
(i) upto 4 B.H.P. anna /1/ (0.06 nP.) per unit in addition to a standing charge of rs.	Facts
2/ per month per B.H.P. connected, (ii) over 4.	None
B. H.P. /9 pies (0.05nP.) per suit in addition to the standing charge at the same rate of Rs. 2/ per B.H.P. per month.4.	Facts
Due to the conditions brought abut by the Second World War, certain orders were made from time to time permitting the licensees to add a surcharge not exceeding 33 1/2 per cent to the existing charges.	Facts
Lastly, on September 30, 1946 an Act was passed by the Bombay legislature called the Bombay Electricity (Surcharge) Act. 1946, hereinafter referred to as the Surcharge Act, which continued the surcharges specified therein for a period of three years.	Facts
This Act expired on September 30, 1949.	Facts
It is said that even thereafter the appellant continued charging the consumers at rates which included the surcharge under the Surcharge Act, and, therefore, at rates in excess of those fixed by the Order of December 30, 1942 and that was illegal.	Facts
The appellant on its part claims that its charges after the expiry of the Surcharge Act were all justified under the Act of 1948 the relevant provisions of which came into force on September 10, 1948.	Facts
This Act will be referred to later.5.	Facts
The respondent Bathena commenced taking electricity from the appellant sometime in 1954.	Facts
Soon thereafter he started disputes about the legality of the charges realised from him by the appellant in respect of energy supplied for purposes of motive power of over 4 B.H.P. and in 1955 filed a suit against the appellant for refund of amounts alleged to have been illegally collected from him in excess of the limits fixed by the Order of December 30, 1942, namely, an excess standing charge of 069 nP. per B.H.P. per month over that fixed by the Order of December 30, 1942 and a similar excess unit charge of 001 nP. per unit.	Facts
That suit is still pending and with the disputes involved in it I am not concerned in this judgment.6.	Facts
On September 25, 1958, the appellant gave notice to its customers that with effect from November 1, 1958 it would charge for motive power 009 nP. per unit plus a standing charge of Rs. 2.69 per B.H.P. per month.	Facts
The unit charge mentioned in the notice was in excess of that prescribed in the order of December 30, 1942 by 004 nP. per unit.	Facts
There is no dispute that this notice revised the unit charge existing at its date but it seems that it did not enhance the then existing standing charge.	Facts
The notice gave rise to further disputes as a result of which two suits were filed against the appellant on March 31, 1959 in the court of the Civil Judge, Belgaum.	Facts
The first of these suits was filed by the respondent Bathena acting for himself and all other consumers of electricity supplied by the appellant for purposes of motive power over 4 B.H.P. for the following reliefs(a) That a declaration be granted by this Honble Court that the standing charges of 2.69 nP. per B.H.P. per month and the excess sum of 004 nP. per unit of energy consumed, for motive power whether connected or otherwise, are illegal and unauthorised, inoperative and ultra vires of the Defendant company and the Plaintiff is not bound to pay the same and that the Defendant Company have no authority to control or interfere in the supply of electric energy or its use, and that the restriction imposed in Notice dated 25958 are illegal, bad in law, and(b) an injunction restraining the DefendantCompany, its servants its agents or its representatives from levying and recovering the excess and illegal charges, i.e., 6 nP. Per unit of consumed energy from the plaintiff, by means of any coercive measures and from interfering or controlling with the electric supply.	Facts
The other suit was filed by the respondent Tendulkar also in a representative capacity in respect of the charge of 037 nP. per unit for electricity supplied for lights and fans, and it sought the following reliefs.(a) That a declaration be granted by this Honble Court that the excess sum 6 nP. per unit of energy consumed for lights and fans are illegal and unauthorised, inoperative and ultra vires of the Defendantcompany and the plaintiff is not bound to pay the same.(b)	Facts
An injunction restraining the DefendantCompany its servants, its agents or its representatives from levying and recovering the excess and illegal charges, i.e., 6 nP. per unit of consumed energy from the plaintiff by means of any coercive measures and from interfering or controlling with the electric supply.	None
Various persons were on their own applications later added as plaintiffs in these suits.7.	None
The suits were decreed by the trial Court but that decision was reversed on appeal by a District Judge.	Facts
On second appeal, however, the High Court of Mysore set aside the decision of the learned District Judge and restored that of the trial Court.	Issue
The present appeals are against the judgment of the High Court.8.	Issue
I will first take up the suit relating to the charges for motive power.	None
To clear the ground it may be stated that this suit is not concerned with any charge made prior to the date that it was filed.	None
As earlier stated, it asks for a declaration and an injunction.	None
An injunction cannot of course be in respect of a past period and the declaration sought must also, therefore, be confined to the future.	None
In any case since the declaration is sought in respect of the charges as revised by the said notice as from November 1, 1958 it is clear that no question as to the legality of any charge made before November 1, 1958 was sought to be raised.	None
It would have been noticed that the suit was concerned with disputes about two charges, namely, the unit charge of 0.09 nP. per unit fixed by the notice of September 25, 1958 and the standing charge of Rs. 2.69 per B.H.P. per month.9.	None
I will first consider the dispute about the unit charge.	Issue
Could the appellant enhance the charge?	None
It is not disputed that a licensee can on his own enhance his charges upto the maximum limit fixed in the licence or otherwise fixed by the Government.	None
The dispute is as to the right to enhance them beyond that limit and in this judgment I will be discussing such enhancement only.	None
It is not in controversy that under the Electricity Act of 1910 it could not do so but as already stated, the appellant bases its claim to enhance the charge on the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 as amended by Act 101 of 1956 with effect from December 30, 1956.	None
It will be noticed that this amendment was in force when the revised rate came into force under the notice of September 25, 1958.	None
The relevant provisions of this Act so amended are theseS. 57.The provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the Seventh Schedule shall be deemed to be incorporated in the licence of every licensee, not being a local authority(a) in the case of licence granted before the commencement of this Act.	None
from the date of the commencement of the licensees next succeeding year of account and(b) in the case of a licence granted after the commencement of this Act, from the date of the commencement of supply,and as from that said date, the licensee shall comply with the provisions of the said Schedules accordingly, and any provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (9 of 1910), and the licence granted to him thereunder and of any other law, agreement or instrument applicable to the licensee shall, in relation to the licensee, be void and of not effect in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Section 57A and the said Schedules.	None
Section 57A.(1) Where the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the Seventh Schedule are under S. 57 deemed to be incorporated in the licence of any licensee, the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the said licensee, namely(a) the Board or where no Board is constituted under this Act, the State Government (i) may, if satisfied that the licensee has failed to comply with any of the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and(ii) shall, when so requested by the licensee in writing, constitute a rating committee to examine the licensees charges for the supply of electricity and to make recommendations in that behalf to the State Government.x	None
x x x(c) a rating committee shall report to the State Governmentmaking recommendations regarding the charges for electricity which the licensee may make(d) within one month after the receipt of the report under clause (c), the State Governmentmaymake an order in accordance therewith fixing the licensees charges for the supply of electricityand the licensee shall forthwith gives effect to such orderSixth Schedule(1)	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (9 of 1910), and the provisions in the licence of a licensee, the licensee shall so adjust his rates for the sale of electricity whether by enhancing or reducing them that his clear profit in any year of account shall not, as far as possible, exceed the amount of reasonable returnx x x xx x x x10.	None
Now the first paragraph of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 clearly gives a licensee the power to adjust and therefore also to enhance his rates on his own.	None
It, however, fixes a limit for the enhancement and that is, so as not as far as possible, to make his clear profit for the year exceed the amount of reasonable return.	None
The methods of determining clear profit and reasonable return are stated respectively in cls.	None
(2) and (9) of paragraph XVII of the Schedule but it will not be necessary for me to go into their details.	None
Now under paragraph I of the Sixth Schedule the rates can be enhanced Notwithstanding anything contained the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (9 of 1910), and the provisions in the licence of a licensee.	None
Nothing to the contrary, therefore, contained in the Act of 1910 or the licence can make the enhancement of the rates by the licensee in terms of this paragraph illegal.	None
It would follow that the power under paragraph I of the Sixth Schedule would justify an enhancement of the rate beyond that fixed by the licence or any order of the government.	None
This seems to me to be perfectly plain.	None
It will be remembered that paragraph XI of the Schedule to the Act of 1910 prohibited a licensee from charging a rate in excess of the maximum fixed by the licence.	None
That provision, however, was repealed by Act 101 of 1956.	None
This was obviously done because it was realised that paragraph	None
I of the Sixth schedule to the Act of 1948 made the prohibition in paragraph XI of the Schedule to the Act of 1910 quite ineffective.	None
Then as we have S. 70(1) of the Act of 1948 which provides thatNo provision of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (9 of 1910), or of any rules made thereunder or of any instrument having effect by virtue of such law or rule shall, so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Act, have any effect.	None
This provision also supports the view that the power to enhance the rates given by the act of 1948 is not in any way affected by anything in the Act of 1910 or the licence granted under it.11.	Reasoning
Learned counsel for the respondents however, first contended that the power to enhance cannot be exercised by the licensee on its own.	Arguments of Respondent
If it wants an increase in its rates it has first to ask the Government under S. 57A of the Act of 1948 to constitute a rating committee.	Arguments of Respondent
This contention appears to me to be entirely unfounded.	None
No doubt a licensee can ask the Government to constitute a rating committee under that section and if the Government does so and fixes rates on the basis of the recommendations of that committee the licensee would be bound by such fixation of rates.	Reasoning
But I find nothing in S. 57A or anywhere else in the Act of 1948 to lead to the view that the licensee cannot increase his rates except after a rating committee has recommended such increase and the Government has permitted it.	Reasoning
Such a view would largely render paragraph I of the Sixth Schedule nugatory.	Reasoning
Nor do I think that there is any conflict between S. 57A and paragraph I as was contended by the respondents.	Reasoning
Quite clearly S. 57A gives a licensee the power to call for the constitution of rating committee.	Reasoning
If he does so, he does not take the risk of fixing an enhanced rate on his own with the possible consequences of having to refund part of the amounts collected under provisions to which reference will be made later.	Reasoning
That seems to be the only reason why the licensee has been given the right to ask for the constitution of a rating committee.	Reasoning
If he does not mind taking the risk of these consequences, I find nothing in the Act of 1948 requiring him to ask for the constitution of a rating committee before he can proceed to enhance the rates on his own.12.	Reasoning
Learned counsel for the respondents then relied on subs.	None
(2) of 70 of the Act of 1948 which states that Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.He contended that this showed that an attempt has to be made to harmonise the two Acts and therefore, the power to enhance the rates given by the Act of 1948 must be confined to an enhancement upto the maxima limits specified in the licence granted or any order made by the government.	Arguments of Respondent
I am wholly unable to agree that subs.	None
(2) of S. 70 of the Act of 1948 requires the two Acts to be harmonised.	None
In fact subs.	None
(1) of S. 70 of the Act of 1948 provides that when there is inconsistency between the two Acts, the earlier Act is not to have effect.	Reasoning
There can be no question of harmonising unless there is inconsistency and subs.	None
(1) says what is to happen in the case of inconsistency it is that one is to give way to the other and not that an attempt should be made to harmonise the two.	None
Furthermore subs.	None
(2) of S. 70 of the Act of 1948 says that Save as otherwise provided in this Act the later Act is not to be read as in derogation of the earlier Act.	Reasoning
When therefore, it is otherwise provided in the Act of 1948, this Act might be read as in derogation of the Act of 1910.	Reasoning
Now S. 57 of the Act of 1948 and paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to it clearly provide that the provisions therein contained are to override the provisions of the earlier Act.	Reasoning
It would thus be against the express terms of the Act of 1948 to attempt to harmonise the power to enhance the rates given to the licensee by it with any of the provisions of the licence or the Act of 1910.13.	Reasoning
Lastly, learned counsel for the respondents relied on Babulal Chaganlal Gujerathi v. Chopda Electric Supply Co. Ltd., ILR (1955)	Arguments of Respondent
Bom 42 (AIR 1955 Bom 182 ) to support his contention that under paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 a licensee had the power to enhance the rates only upto the maxima limits specified in the licence or governments order but not beyond those limits.	Arguments of Respondent
It was no doubt so decided in that case but then it turned on Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule as it stood before the amendment in 1956.	None
Before the amendment, that paragraph did not contain the words Nowwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (9 of 1910) and the provisions in the licence of a licencee.	Reasoning
It seems to me plain that these words have made a material change in the provisions and as it now stands, it cannot be said that the enhancement permitted must be restricted to the limit fixed in the licence or an order by the government.	Reasoning
The decision cited, therefore, is of no assistance in interpreting Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule as it stands after the amendment in 1956.	Reasoning
Whether Chaganlals case.	Reasoning
ILR (1955)	Reasoning
Bom 42 (AIR 1955 Bom 182 ) was correctly decided in view of the terms of Paragraph 1 as it stood before the amendment is not a question which arises for determination in this case and on that question I express no opinion.	Reasoning
I think that it must be held on the terms of Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 as it stood at the time of the notice that a licensee had power to enhance the rates and such power was not limited to an enhancement up to the limits fixed by the licence or otherwise by any order of the government.14.	None
On the question whether under Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 a licensee could enhance his rates beyond the limits fixed by the government or in the licence the High Court took the same view as I have done and held that the respondents could not claim any relief solely on the ground that the rates charged had exceeded those limits.	None
The High Court, however, observed that the appellant had failed to establish that it had revised its rates as provided by the Act of 1948 before its amendment in 1956 and, therefore, held that the appellant must be taken to have illegally continued the surcharge which it was levying under the Surcharge Act. 1946 even after its expiry on October 1, 1949.	None
It is somewhat difficult to understand these observations.	None
As I have earlier said, no question as to the legality of any charge made before the suit or at any rate, before November 1, 1958, arises in this case.	Reasoning
Therefore, even if the appellant had not revised its charge prior to the amendment, no grievance on that account can be made on the plaint on which the present suit is based.	None
Furthermore I do not see why the burden of proving that those charges were the charges duly revised under the Act of 1948 prior to its amendment should be upon the appellant.	Reasoning
No issue on this question also appears to have been framed by the trial Court at all.	Reasoning
Even the plaint does not say that what the appellant had done was to continue an illegal charge.	Reasoning
I repeat that whether the charges made before November 1, 1958 were illegal or not, is not a question that arises for decision in these cases.	Reasoning
Admittedly the notice of September 25, 1958, revised the unit charge and, therefore, in fact there was no continuation of an earlier illegal charge, assuming the earlier charge to have been illegal.15.	Reasoning
The High Court, however, also held that the appellant was under a statutory duty under the Act of 1948 to adjust its rates so that its clear profit did not exceed the amount of reasonable return and it had not established that it had done so after the Act was amended, nor had it proved that the enhancement mentioned in the notice of September 25, 1958 would not result in its clear profits exceeding the amount of reasonable return.	Reasoning
Lastly, the High Court observed that Even otherwise the enhancement is the continuation of the illegal charges and that by itself is invalid.	Reasoning
It was on these grounds that the High Court decided the cases in favour of the respondents.	Reasoning
I am unable to agree with the High Court on any of these points.16.	Reasoning
I will take the last point first.	Reasoning
With respect to the learned Judges of the High Court.	Reasoning
I do not understand what exactly is meant by the enhancement being the continuation of the illegal charge.	Reasoning
That there was a revision of the rates by the notice of September 25, 1958 is the respondents own case in the plaint.	Reasoning
I will assume that the revision raised the rates to the figures that were chargeable under the expired Surcharge Act of 1946.	Reasoning
But the identity of the figures cannot by itself make the enhancement illegal if it was legal under the Act of 1948 as amended.	Reasoning
Indeed as there was admittedly a revision there was really no continuation of a previous charge.	Reasoning
This point must, therefore, be rejected.17.	Reasoning
The other points on which, as stated above, the High Court based itself, appear to me to be equally untenable.	Reasoning
These points are really one and that is whether the appellant has established that the revised rate fixed by the notice of September 25, 1958 would not make its clear profit exceed the amount of reasonable return.	Reasoning
As already stated, it is admitted in the plaint that there was a revision of the unit charge by the notice.	Reasoning
So it is not in dispute that after the amendment of Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule the appellant had revised its unit charge.	Reasoning
I am unable to agree that the onus of establishing that the revision did not make the appellants clear profit exceed the amount of a reasonable return should be on the appellant.	Reasoning
I think that onus should be on the respondents because it is they who allege that the rates mentioned by the defendant are exceeding the reasonable return.	Reasoning
The more serious objection to this point, however is that it does not seem to me that it is competent for a civil court to go into the question whether the enhanced rates are illegal because they take the clear profit beyond the amount of the reasonable return, and to give any relief on that basis.	Reasoning
The reasons for this view will now be stated.18.	None
Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 no doubt prohibits the licensee from enhancing his rates beyond a figure which would make his clear profit exceed the amount of reasonable return.	None
The Act, however, at the same time provided the consequences of a breach of the prohibition.	None
Thus the fourth and the last proviso in Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 states.	None
Provided further that if the rates of supply fixed in pursuance of the recommendations of a rating committee constituted under S. 57A are lower than those notified by the licensee under and in accordance with the proceeding proviso, the licensee shall refund to the consumers the excess amount recovered by him from them.	None
One consequence of the breach of the prohibition therefore, is the liability to refund the difference between the enhanced rate which has to be notified under the third proviso and that fixed by the rating committee.	None
But a rating committee may not have been constituted, for it is constituted only where the licensee wants it, or the Government if entitled to constitute it under S. 57A (1) of the Act of 1948.	None
Where a rating committees is not constituted, there is no liability to refund but the provisions of Paragraph II of the Schedule would then apply and this equally whether there is an enhancement of the charge under Paragraph 1 and where there is none.	None
That paragraph is in these terms Paragraph II (I).	None
If the clear profit of a licensee in any year of account is in excess of the amount of reasonable return onethird of such excess, not exceeding five per cent of the amount of reasonable return, shall be at the disposal of the undertaking.	None
Of the balance of the excess, onehalf shall be appropriated to a reserve which shall be called the Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve and the remaining half shall either be distributed in the form of a proportional rebate on the amounts collected from the sale of electricity and meter rentals or carried forward in the accounts of the licensee for distribution to the consumers in future, in such manner as the State Government may direct.	None
This provision shows that where there was a revised rate and that rate exceeded the limit prescribed in Paragraph I, a consumer might get a refund of a part of the excess but that too only at the discretion of the government.	Reasoning
He had clearly no right to any refund even in such a case.	Reasoning
Quite obviously if the consumer could obtain refund of the whole excess as determined by a civil court, these provisions would be completely meaningless.	Reasoning
Equally obviously if a civil court could decide that the charge made had exceeded the limit and was, therefore, illegal, it could also direct a refund of the amount illegally realised.	Reasoning
Therefore, it seems to me clear that the question of a breach of the terms of the first part of Paragraph I of the Sixth Schedule was not intended to be canvassed in a civil court a civil court has no power to decide that question nor can it give any relief in respect thereof.	Reasoning
Indeed if this were not so the consequences would be most anomalous.	Reasoning
If the civil court could decide the question whether the enhanced rate resulted in the clear profit exceeding the amount of the reasonable return, then it is conceivable that different courts might come to different conclusions on different materials placed before them and the result of that would be to destroy the uniformity of rates chargeable by a licensee.	Reasoning
Such a situation could not have been intended.	Reasoning
Again the Act of 1948 did not give to the consumer the right to have a rating committee constituted.	Reasoning
This was obviously because it would be impossible to work a public utility concern like an electric supply business if every consumer could get a rating committee to go into the question of rates.	Reasoning
There may then be a continuous succession of rating committees and there would be no fixity of the rates chargeable.	Reasoning
The convenience of all had to be kept in mind.	Reasoning
Power was hence given only to the Government to take steps when a licensee committed a breach of its obligations.	Reasoning
Therefore, in my opinion, the High Court was in error in holding that the appellant should have shown that the enhancement did not result in its clear profit exceeding the amount of reasonable return and in deciding in favour of the respondents on that basis.	Reasoning
I hold that the respondents were not entitled to canvass in a civil court any question as to the rates of a licensee being in excess of the limit prescribed in Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948.	Reasoning
A civil court could not declare that the rates charged by a licensee were illegal as they made its clear profit exceed the reasonable return.	Reasoning
If there was such excess, the relief could be obtained only if the Government set up a rating committee, a refund became due thereupon under the last proviso to Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 or if relief was available under Paragraph II (1) of that Schedule.19.	Reasoning
Then it was said that the revision by the notice of September 25,1958 was bad in any case because under the third proviso to Paragraph 1 in the Sixth Schedule there could be no revision of rates under that paragraph unless a notice in writing of the intention to enhance was given by the licensee to the Government or to the State Electricity Board and no such notice was in fact given.	Reasoning
That proviso no doubt require a notice to be given but the contention is nonetheless clearly without foundation for as I shall immediately show such a notice was in fact given.	Reasoning
Now Ex. 62 is a copy of a letter received by the appellant from the Secretary of the State Electricity Board and it refers to a letter.	Reasoning
No AMAL BEL C2 dated 781958 written by the appellant to the Board and the letter last mentioned, which is Ex. 60, is the notice by the appellant to the Board expressing its intention to revise the rates.	Reasoning
It is quite clear, therefore, that notice had been given to the Board of the proposed enhancement.	Reasoning
This point, it may be stated, does not seem to have been taken in the High Court.20.	Reasoning
It was also said that the notice was bad as it did not state that the standing charge was being increased from Rs. 2/ to Rs. 2.69 per B.H.P. per month.	Reasoning
This again is an unfounded contention for the standing charge had not been increased by the notice at all.	Reasoning
Indeed the plaint itself in Paragraph 5 states that prior to November 1, 1958 the appellant had been levying standing charges at the rate of Rs. 2.69.	Reasoning
So there was no enhancement of this charge by the notice and, hence no question of giving any notice of any enhancement of the standing charge arises.21.	Reasoning
Lastly, it was said that in the notice to the consumers it was stated that the power supply would be restricted between certain hours but the notice to the government did not mention this restriction in the supply.	Reasoning
The notice to the consumers no doubt stated that the revised unit charge would be in respect of restricted hours of supply but that does not make the contention of any substance.	Reasoning
There was nothing in the notice to show that the supply would be restricted.	Reasoning
Further it is neither alleged in the plaint nor does it appear from anything on the record, that there was in fact any restriction in the supply.	Reasoning
That being so, the failure to give notice to the government of the restriction in the supply is wholly immaterial.	Reasoning
I have not, further, been shown any provision under which notice to the government of a restriction in the supply of electricity is necessary.	Reasoning
It is certainly not required by anything in Paragraph 1 in the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948.22.	Reasoning
I am, therefore, of the opinion that there is no reason to hold that the appellant was not entitled to levy the charge mentioned in its notice of September 25, 1948.23.	Reasoning
I come now to the standing charge of Rs. 2.69 per B.H.P. per month.	Reasoning
As in the case of the other charge and for the same reasons.	Reasoning
I am not concerned with any question as to its legality in respect of any period prior to the suit.	Reasoning
It has to be remembered that there is no complaint that this rate had been increased, by the notice.	Reasoning
Lastly, as already stated, a civil court cannot go into the question whether a charge is illegal inasmuch as it has been revised to an amount exceeding the limit mentioned in Paragraph 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948.	Reasoning
The only ground on which this charge is questioned is put up in Paragraph 23 of the plaint in these words any standing charges along with the usual Unit Charges is against equity and law, it being double charge for the industry to pay for the enrichment of the defendants the legality of the standing charge is not challenged on any other ground.	Reasoning
Now where a charge is permitted by a statute no question of its being inequitable can be raised in a court of law neither can the question whether the charge is in excess of the limit justified by the statute be canvassed in such a court.	Reasoning
Therefore, the respondents cannot in these cases challenge the legality of the standing charge.24.	Reasoning
What I have said so far disposes of the appeal in the suit concerning the rates charged for the supply of motive power.	Reasoning
That appeal must therefore be allowed.25.	Reasoning
The appeal in the suit with regard to the charges for lights and fans can be disposed of substantially on the grounds earlier discussed.	Reasoning
The High Court also placed its decision in respect of this matter on the same ground on which it had disposed of the other matter.	Reasoning
The only point made in this case is that the appellant had been wrongfully charging a rate in excess of the limit fixed by the order of December 30, 1942 by 006 np.	Reasoning
per unit.	Reasoning
On this basis a declaration that the excess charge was illegal was sought and also an injunction restraining the appellant from levying it.	Reasoning
It will be observed that in this case there was no notice given by the appellant of any increase in the charge.	Reasoning
No question of the charge being illegal by reason of any enhancement, therefore, arises.	Reasoning
The only complaint is that the charge is illegal as it is in excess of the limit fixed by the government.	Reasoning
As I have said, under Paragraphs I and II of the Sixth Schedule to the Act of 1948 a licensee can charge any amount so that his clear profit does not exceed his reasonable return and if he exceeds the limit he only exposes himself to the consequences mentioned in them and a consumer cannot go to a court of law for relief on the ground that the licensee had exceeded this limit.	Reasoning
Therefore, the respondent cannot ask for any relief in a civil court on the basis that the appellant had exceed the limit.	Reasoning
As in the other case, in this case also I am not concerned with the legality of any charge made prior to the date of the suit the only question is the legality of the charge made since March 31, 1959.	Reasoning
That question has to be decided under Act of 1948 as amended in 1956.	Reasoning
It follows that in this case also the respondents can get no assistance from the decision in Babulal Chaganlal, ILR (1955)	Reasoning
Bom 42 (AIR 1955 Bom 182 ) even if that case was rightly decided.	None
I therefore, think that this appeal also succeeds.26.	Decision
In the result I would allow both the appeals with costs throughout.	Decision
AYYANGAR, J. (For himself and Das Gupta J.)27.	None
These two appeals which come before us by virtue of special leave granted by this Court are against a common judgment of the High Court of Mysore in two Second Appeals preferred to it by the respective respondents in the two appeals.	Issue
They raise for consideration a question of the legality of certain rates charged by the AppellantCompany for the supply of electricity to the respondents for power and for lights and fans respectively.28.	Issue
The Appellantcompany is a licensee who is engaged in the business of supplying electricity in the town of Belgaum and other places.	None
A licence for the supply of electricity in the town of Belgaum was granted in 1932 to two persons V. S. Ankle and A. S. Ankle.	Facts
These two assigned their licence to a concern by name the Belgaum Electricity Co. Ltd. and by a further assignment by these assignees, the licence came to be owned by the Appellant who are now effecting the distribution and supply of electricity in Belgaum.	Facts
The original licence was granted by the Government of Bombay under S. 3 of the Indian Electricity Act of 1910 (Act IX of 1910) which we shall hereafter refer to as the Electricity Act, 1910 to whose provisions some reference would be necessary to be made later.	Facts
Broadly speaking under the provisions of this enactment the maximum and minimum rates which a licensee might charge its consumers were fixed by Government and licensees were afforded freedom to fix the rates to be actually charged within these limits.	Facts
Under the powers so vested in them in that behalf the Government of Bombay within whose jurisdiction Belgaum then was, passed an order on December 30, 1942 fixing the maximum rates which could be charged by licensees for supply to consumers and these rates which applied to the Appellant were to be effective from February 1, 1943.	Facts
The maximum rates for the supply of energy under the licence were, under this order, to be (1) where the energy was supplied for lights and fans 5 annas per unit (2) where energy was supplied for power purposes i.e., for purposes other than lights and fans the maximum rate was to be (a) upto and including 4 B.H.P. one anna per unit in addition to a standing charge of Rs. 2/ per month per B.H.P. connected, and (b) for over 4 B.H.P. the rate was 0.75 nP. unit it addition to a standing charge of Rs.2/ per month per B.H.P. connected.	Facts
Thereafter charges at the maximum permitted rate were levied and collected by the Appellant.	Facts
While so, on March 11, 1943 a notification was issued by the government of Bombay in exercise of powers conferred by rule 81 (2) (b) of the Defence of India Rules by which relaxation was made as regards the maximum rates for the supply of electrical energy chargeable by a licensee under the Electricity Act, Such licensees were permitted to charge amounts not exceeding 33 1/3 over the permitted maximum rates.	Facts
Later this surcharge under the Defence of India Rules fixed by the notification of 1943, was withdrawn and simultaneously what is known as War Costs Surcharge was permitted to be levied, but it did not make any practical difference as the permitted increases over the maximum was identical.	Facts
The War Costs Surcharge was continued up to the year 1946 when the Government of Bombay enacted a statute entitled the Bombay Electricity (Surcharge) Act of 1946 which came into force on September 30, 1946.	Facts
It was a temporary enactment which under subs.	None
(4) of S. 1 was to be in force for a period of three years only so that it lapsed on October 1, 1949.	Facts
The Provincial Government was under S. 3 of that Act empowered to fix rates of surcharge and under S. 5 of that Act the existing surcharge viz., the War Costs Surcharge were to be deemed surcharges fixed under S. 3.	Facts
As a result of this piece of legislation the position that emerged was that though the original licence issued under the Electricity Act, 1910 which empowered the Government to fix the maximum of the rates that could be charged by licensees for the supply of energy was determined by the order dated December 30, 1942, still practically almost from the commencement of the operation of that order a 33 1/3 surcharge was permitted to be levied by the licensees over the permitted maximum charge and this state of things continued until October 1, 1949.29.	Facts
Notwithstanding the lapse of the Act of 1946 the Appellant has continued to demand and collect practically the same charges for the supply of energy as it had done during the period when it was in force, with a slight variation by way of increase in regard to the supply of power to which we shall immediately advert.	None
In the case of supply for power, while the standing charges are being levied at the maximum permitted by the notification of December 30, 1942 with the addition of the surcharge, the unit charge has been increased even beyond this figure by resort to the provisions of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 (Central Act 54 of 1948) which it will be convenient to refer to as the Supply Act.	None
The legality of the continuance of the surcharge in regard to the standing charge from and after 1/10/1949 and of the increase in the unit rate even beyond it are challenged in the suit which has given rise to Civil Appeal 590 of 1963.	None
In the case of the charge for the supply of energy for lights and fans there has been no change since the 30th September 1949, but the maximum as increased by 33 1/3 still continues and it is the legality of this continuance of the surcharge that is impugned in Civil Appeal No. 591 of 1963.	None
The levy of the rates impugned is in every case justified by the Appellant by reference to the terms of the Supply Act to the relevant provisions of which we shall have to make detailed reference later.30.	None
Pausing here, we might advert to the fact that the Supply Act was enacted to provide for the rationalisation of the purchase and supply of electricity and generally for taking measures conducive to the electrical development.	None
The Act came into force from September 10, 1948.	None
The principal question that arises for decision in these appeals relates to the effect of the Supply Act, 1948 and the provisions that it contains on the rates to be charged by licensees which had been fixed under the Electricity Act, 1910a matter which we shall examine in its proper place.	Issue
We might even at this stage refer to S. 70 of the Supply Act which enacts1.	None
No provision of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, or of any rules made thereunder or of any instrument having effect by virtue of such law or rule shall, so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Act, have any effectProvided that nothing in this Act shall be deemed to prevent the State Government from granting, after consultation with the Board, a licence not inconsistent with the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act 1910, to any person in respect of such area and on such terms and conditions the State Government may think fit.2.	None
Save as otherwise provided in this Act, the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.We are drawing attention to this provision to indicate the interrelation between the two Acts  the Electricity Act, 1910 and the Supply Act, 1948.31.	Reasoning
We shall now briefly narrate the course of the proceedings which have led to the present appeals.	None
Two suits were filed by consumers of electrical energy in Belgaum receiving their supplies from the Appellant in the court of Civil Judge, Belgaum, both being representative suits under O. I. R. 8 of the Civil Procedure Code.	Facts
The first suit No 133 of 1959 was in relation to the supply of energy for power.	Facts
In the plaint it was pointed out that before November 1, 1958 the Appellant was charging the plaintiffs Rs. 2/11/ per B. H. Power per month as standing charges plus one anna per unit of energy consumed.	Facts
It was stated that the Appellant had by a notice to the consumers dated September 25, 1958, whose terms were set out, proposed to raise from and after November 1, 1958 the unit charge from one anna per unit to 1 1/2 anna or 9 naye paise per unit.	Facts
It recited that the plaintiffs had protested and addressed letters to the Government of Mysore, (Belgaum having been made part of this State by the State Reorganisation Act) but without any result.	Facts
Reference was made to the circumstance that the appellant justified the increase with reference to the provisions of the Supply Act, particularly after the same was amended by Central Act 101 of 1956.	Facts
The material averment on the basis of which relief was claimed in the plaint was that the revision effected by the notice of September 25, 1958 was illegal because it exceeded the maximum prescribed by the Government of Bombay in its order dated December 30, 1942 which, it was stated, still bound the Appellant.	Facts
The plaintiffs, therefore, sought a declaration that any increase beyond the rates fixed by the notification of the year 1942 was illegal and sought a declaration (a) that the standing charge was illegal to the extent of the excess of 69 nP. per B.H.P. over the 2 rupees and the increase by 4 naye paise per unit of energy consumed was also illegal and prayed for an injunction restraining the Appellant from levying or collecting these illegal and excess charges.32.	Facts
The other suit in relation to supply of energy for lights and fans was No. 135 of 1959.	Facts
That plaint pointed out that under the order of Government of Bombay dated December 30, 1942 the appellant could charge only 5 annas per unit or in decimal coinage 31 nP and taking advantage of the surcharges that were permitted during the war period and subsequently under the Bombay Electricity (Surcharge) Act 1946 it had been charging 6 anna per unit, and after the decimal coinage came into force 37 nP. The main point that was urged in the plaint was that on the lapse of the Bombay Electricity (Surcharge) Act 1956 on September 30, 1959 the right of the Appellant to charge anything above 31 nP ceased but that notwithstanding this want of legal sanction it had continued to levy the same rates even afterwards.	Facts
On this basis a prayer was made seeking a declaration about the invalidity of any charge beyond 31 nP per unit and an injunction restraining the appellant from charging this illegal excess.33.	Facts
The defence of the Appellant was based on the provisions contained in the Supply Act of 1948, the contention being that the charges they continued to levy or which they intended to levy by virtue of the notice of September 25, 1958, were well within the limits prescribed by the Supply Act of 1948 and consequently the plaintiffs in neither suit were entitled to any relief.34.	Facts
The learned trial Judge held on an examination of the provisions of the two Acts  the Electricity Act and the Supply Actand their schedules that even after the coming into force of the Supply Act the maximum limit of charge fixed by Government under the Electricity Act of 1910 continued to govern the maximum rate that could be charged and as admittedly the rates charged or threatened to be charged by the Appellant were in excess of those rates, it granted to the plaintiffs in each suit the declaration and injunction they sought.35.	Facts
The appellant thereupon filed appeals to the learned District Judge and contended that the Supply Act of 1948 effected such a radical change in the method of determining the reasonable rate as to completely supersede the rates and the maxima fixed under the Electricity Act of 1910.	Facts
This contention was accepted by the Appellate Court and the appeals were allowed and the suits directed to be dismissed.	Facts
The plaintiffs thereafter filed second appeals to the High Court.	Facts
The learned Single Judge of the Mysore High Court who heard the appeals accepted in part the submission made by the Appellant that the maxima prescribed by the Government under the powers vested in them by the Electricity Act of 1910 ceased to be in force on the enactment of the Supply Act.	Facts
He nevertheless held that the procedure prescribed for the fixing of rates to be charged by the licensees by the Supply Act of 1948 had not been followed by the Appellant with the result that it could not sustain the contention that the charges levied or to be levied were legal.	Facts
On this reasoning the learned Judge allowed the appeals and restored the decrees of the trial Court in two suits.	Facts
It is from these judgments of the High Court that the present appeals have been brought by special leave of this Court.36.	Facts
Before setting out the arguments addressed to us on behalf of the Appellant and to appreciate them it is necessary to read the statutory provisions which bear upon the controversy in the appeal.	None
The appellant was, as stated earlier, the transferee of a licence granted under the Electricity Act, 1910.	None
Section 3 of this Act enables the State Government, on application made to it, to grant to any person a licence to supply energy in any specified area.	Facts

(3) (a saving not now relevant) the prices charged by the licensee for energy supplied by him shall not exceed the maxima fixed by his licence, or, in the case of a method of charge approved by the State Government, such maxima as the State Government shall fix on approving the method.37A. It was in exercise of the powers conferred by the State Government under Section 3 (2) of this Act that the notification dated December 30, 1942 to which reference has already been made was issued and under it the charges for supply were fixed.	None
While narrating the facts we have already set out the maximum rate which was fixed as that which could be levied by licensees under the Act both for the supply of energy for power as well as for lights and fans.	None
This notification came into force on and was effective from February 1, 1943.	None
We have already seen how by virtue first of the notification under the Defence of India Rules and later under the War Costs Surcharge and still later under the Bombay Act of 1946, the maximum was raised by 33 1/3 of that specified in the notification of December 30, 1942 and how these rates continued to be validly charged by the Appellant till September 30, 1949 when the Bombay Act of 1946 lapsed.38.	None
The question that now falls to be considered is as regards the legality of the continuance of this rate beyond the maximum prescribed by the notification of December 30, 1942 subsequent to September 30, 1949.	Issue
For this purpose, it is necessary to refer to the Supply Act of 1948 and it is on the proper construction of its provisions and their effect on the limitations prescribed by the previous law on the rates to be charged that the decision of these appeals turns.	None
Reference has already been made to S. 70 of the Supply Act, 1948 and this provisions would show that where there is any inconsistency between the two Acts, the Supply Act, 1948 would prevail and it is only to the extent that the two enactments do not cover the same field that the provisions of the Electricity Act, 1910 would continue in operation.	None
Coming now to the provision relating to the fixation of the rates to be charged by a licensee for the supply of energy the relevant provisions of the Supply Act dealing with it are those contained in Ss. 57 and 57A and read with Sch.	None
VI of the Act.39.	None
Pausing here it is necessary to mention that some of the provisions of the Supply Act of 1948 were amended by Central Act 101 of 1956 and among them was S. 57.	None
Section 57, as originally enacted, contained substantially the same provisions as are after amendment contained in Ss. 57 and 57A and as thus there has been no material change effect by the Amendment for the purposes of the present appeal.	None
We shall set out Ss. 57 and 57A which were in force when the present proceedings were commenced57.	None
The provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the Seventh Schedule shall be deemed to be incorporated in the licence of every licensee, not being a local authority(a) in the case of a licence granted before the commencement of this Act, from the date of the commencement of the licensees next succeeding year of account and(b) in the case of a licence granted after the commencement of this Act, from the date of the commencement of supply.and as from the said date, the licensee shall comply with the provisions of the said Schedules accordingly, and any provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, and the licence granted to him thereunder and of any other law, agreement or instrument applicable to the licensee shall, in relation to the licensee be void and of no effect in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of S. 57A and the said Schedules.57A. (1) Where the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the Seventh Schedule are under S. 57 deemed to be incorporated in the licence of any licensee, the following provisions shall have effect in relation to the said licensee namely(a) the Board or where no Board is constituted under this Act, the State Government(i) may, if satisfied that the licensee has failed to comply with any of the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and(ii) shall, when so requested by the licensee in writing.constitute a rating committee to examine the licensees charges for the supply of electricity and to make recommendations in that behalf to the State Government.	None
Provided that where it is proposed to constitute a rating committee under this section on account of the failure of the licensee to comply with any provisions of the Sixth Schedule, such committee shall not be constituted unless the licencee has been given a notice in writing of thirty clear days (which period, if the circumstances so warrant may be extended from time to time) to show cause against the action proposed to be takenProvided further that no such rating committee shall be constituted if the alleged failure of the licensee to comply with any provisions of the Sixth Schedule raises any dispute or difference as to the interpretation of the said provisions or any matter arising therefrom and such difference or dispute has been referred by the licensee to the arbitration of the Authority under Paragraph XVI of the Schedule before the notice referred to in the preceding proviso was given or is so referred within the period of the said noticeProvided further that no rating committee shall be constituted in respect of a licensee within three years from the date on which such a committee has reported in respect of that licensee, unless the State Government declares that in its opinion circumstances have arisen rendering the orders passed on the recommendations of the previous rating commtee unfair to the licensee or any of his consumers(b) (c) (d) within one month after the receipt of the report under cl.	Arguments of Petitioner
(c), the State Government shall cause the report to be published in the Official Gazette, and may at the same time make an order in accordance therewith fixing the licensees charges for the supply of electricity with effect from such date, not earlier than two months or later than three months, after the date of publication of the report as may be specified in the order and the licensee shall forthwith give effect to such order(e) (The other subsecs.

(2) to (8) are not material and so are omitted).40.	None
Schedule VI referred to in Ss. 57 and 57A has undergone modification as a result of the amendment effected by Act 101 of 1956 and some argument has turned on these changes.	None
We shall set out Para I and also para II of this Schedule as they stood when originally enacted and as they now read.	None
As enacted the first two paragraphs ranI. The licensee shall so adjust his rates for the sale of electricity by periodical revision that his clear profit in any year shall not as far as possible exceed the amount of reasonable returnProvided that the licensee shall not be considered to have failed so to adjust his rates if the clear profit in any year of account has not exceeded the amount of the reasonable return by more than thirty per centum of the amount of the reasonable return.	None
II.	None
(1) If the clear profit of a licensee in any year of account is in excess of the amount of reasonable return, onethird of such excess not exceeding 7 1/2 per cent, of the amount of reasonable return, shall be at the disposal of the undertaking.	None
Of the balance of the excess, onehalf shall be appropriated to a reserve which shall be called the Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve and the remaining half shall either be distributed in the form of a proportional rebate on the amounts collected from the sale of electricity and meter rentals or carried forward in the accounts of the licensee for distribution to the consumers in future, in such manner as the State Government may direct.2.	None
The Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve shall be available for disposal by the licensee only to the extent by which the clear profit is less than the reasonable return in any year of account.3.	None
On the purchase of the undertaking under the terms of its license any balance remaining in the Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve shall be handed over to the purchaser and maintained as such Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve.	None
These paragraphs were amended in 1956 to readI. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 except subsec.	None
(2) of 22A, and the provisions in the licence of a licensee, the licensee shall so adjust his rates for the sale of electricity whether by enhancing or reducing them, that his clear profit in any year of account shall not, as far as possible, exceed the amount of reasonable returnProvided that such rates shall not be enhanced more than once in any year of accountProvided further that the licensee shall not be deemed to have failed so to adjust his rates if the clear profit in any year of account has not exceeded the amount of reasonable return by thirty per centum of the amount of reasonable returnProvided further that the licensee shall not enhance the rates for the supply of electricity until after the expiry of a notice in writing of not less than sixty clear days of his intention to the enhance the rates, given by the him to the State Government and to the BoardProvided further that if the rates of supply fixed in pursuance of the recommendations of a rating committee constituted under S. 57A are lower than those notified by the license under and in accordance with the preceding proviso, the licensee shall refund to the consumers the excess amount recovered by him from them.	None
II.	None
(1) If the clear profit of a licensee in any year of account is in excess of the amount of reasonable return, onethird of such excess, not exceeding 7( per cent of the amount of reasonable return, shall be at the disposal of the undertaking.	None
Of the balance of the excess, onehalf shall be appropriated to a reserve which shall be called the Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve and the remaining half shall either be distributed in the form of proportional rebate on the amounts collected from the sale of electricity and meter rentals or carried forward in the accounts of the licensee for distribution to the consumers in future, in such manner as the State Government may direct.(2) The Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve shall be available for disposal by the licensee only to the extent by which the clear profit is less than the reasonable return in any year of account.(3)	None
On the purchase of the undertaking under the terms of its licence any balance remaining in the Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve shall be handed over to the purchaser and maintained as such Tariffs and Dividends Control Reserve.	None
Paragraph 17 of this Schedule contains the definitions and among the terms there defined is clear profitan expression used in paragraphs I and II.	None
As nothing material turns on the manner in which the clear profit is to be computed which is described in Para 17 we do not think it necessary to refer to the details contained there.41.	None
The questions raised before us are principally three (1) The effect of the Supply Act, 1948 on the maxima of rates fixed by Government under S. 3(2) of the Electricity Act, 1910 which could be charged by a licensee.	Issue
The submission of the appellant which was accepted by the High Court but which was contested by the respondents before us was that any changes that might be effect by a licensee acting under the provisions under S. 57 of the Supply Act read with Paragraph 1 of Sch.	Arguments of Petitioner
VI in revising his rates so as to derive the reasonable return permitted by these provisions had still to be within the maxima prescribed by Government under the Electricity Act of 1910.	None
(2) The next point was that assuming that the Appellant was right on point No. 1, whether the charges demanded by the appellantcompany from the respondents were legal and justified by the Supply Act.	None
It is on this point that the learned Single Judge in the High Court has upheld the contention urged by the respondent, (3) Closely related to the 2nd point, the limits of the jurisdiction of a Civil Court to afford relief to consumers who complained of excessive charges being demanded by licensees.42.	None
So far as the 1st point is concerned viz., whether the maxima prescribed by Government under the Electricity Act, 1910 still continues to bind the licensee after the coming into force of the Supply Act, we feel no hesitation in agreeing with the submission of the Appellant which found favour with the High Court.	Reasoning
Section 57 of the Supply Act, 1948 both as originally enacted and as amended in 1956 expressly provided that the provisions of the VIth Schedule shall be deemed to be incorporated in the license of every licensee and that the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and the license granted thereunder and any other law, agreement or instrument applicable to the licensee shall be void and of no effect in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of the section and the said Schedule.	Reasoning
Read in the light of S. 70 of the Supply Act it would follow that if any restriction incorporated in the licence granted under the Electricity Act, 1910 is inconsistent with the rate which a licensee might charge under Para I of Sch.	Reasoning
VI of the Supply Act, 1948, the former would, to that extent, be superseded and the latter would prevail.43.	Reasoning
Para I of Sch.	Reasoning
VI both as it originally stood and as amended, as seen already empowered the licensee to adjust his rates, so that his clear profit in any year shall not, as far as possible, exceed the amount of reasonable return.	Reasoning
We shall reserve for later consideration the meaning of the expression so adjust his rates.	Reasoning
But one thing is clear and that is that the adjustment is unilateral and that the licensee has a statutory right to adjust his rates provided he conforms to the requirements of that paragraph viz.	Reasoning
, the rate charged does not yield a profit exceeding the amount of reasonable return.	Reasoning
The conclusion is therefore irresistible that the maxima prescribed by the State Government which bound the licensee under the Electricity Act of 1910 no longer limited the amount which a licensee could charge after the Supply Act, 1948 came into force, since the clear profit and reasonable return which determined the rate to be charged was to be computed on the basis of very different criteria and factors than what obtained under the Electricity Act.	Reasoning
In support of the submission that notwithstanding the Supply Act the maxima fixed by the State Government was still binding on the licensee and that any adjustment within 1st paragraph of Sch.	None
VI should be within the limits of this maxima we were referred to a decision of the Bombay High Court reported as 56 Bom LR 994 (ILR (1955)	None
Bom 42 (AIR 1955 Bom 182 ).	None
It is sufficient to extract the head note to understand the point of the decisionSection 57(1) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, or Cl. 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Act, does not confer a right upon a licensee unilaterally to alter the terms and conditions on which supply may be made by a licensee of electrical energy consumers in the area of supply irrespective of the restrictions contained in the license and the Indian Electricity Act.	None
1910.Not only does S. 57 (1) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, impose an obligation upon the licensee to conform to the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the table appended to the Seventh Schedule to the Act, but the first clause of the Sixth Schedule imposes a further obligation to make periodical revisions and to adjust the profits so that his profits in any year do not as for as possible exceed a reasonable return on his investment.	None
There is nothing in S. 57 or in the first clause of the Sixth Schedule which either expressly or by implication amends the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910,contained in S. 3 (2) (d) or in S. 21 (2) of that Act or the rates and methods of charging the same as fixed by the license.	None
The provision contained in S. 3 (2) (d) of Indian Electricity Act, 1910, which requires the State Government to prescribe the terms and conditions under which the supply of energy is to be made is not affected by the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948.	None
The right to amend the license is conferred by the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, upon the State Government and that right is not affected by the Electricity (Supply) Act.	None
1948.44.	None
With great respect to the learned Judge we are unable to agree with this decision, for, in our opinion, the provisions of the Supply Act, 1948 to which we have adverted are to strong to permit the construction, that the maxima prescribed under the Electricity Act of 1910 survives as a fetter on the rights of the licensee under paragraph I of the VIth Schedule.	Reasoning
If there was any room for any argument of this kind on the terms of Para I of Sch.	Reasoning
VI as originally enacted, the matter is placed beyond possibility of dispute by the amendment effected by Act 101 of 1956 to the VIth Schedule where the opening paragraph commences with the words notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Electricity Act and the provisions in the licence of a licensee.	Reasoning
We, therefore, consider that the first submission of learned Counsel for the Appellant that the limit imposed by the maxima prescribed by the State Government ceased to be in force after the Supply Act of 1948 came into force is well founded.45.	Reasoning
The next question for consideration is whether the action of the appellant company in continuing the charge the rates that it was permitted to charge by virtue of the War Costs.	Issue
(Surcharge) Rules and the Bombay Supply Act, 1946 i.e., by making an addition of 33( to the maxima which he was permitted by the notification dated December 30, 1942 is lawful.	None
This would have a vital bearing on the point involved in Civil Appeal 591 of 1963 which relates to the unit charge for light and fans for domestic consumption as well as on the legality of the standing charges for the supply of power which is raised in Civil Appeal 590 of 1963.	None
It would be recalled that in these cases the Appellant has merely continued the charges that it was making before September 30, 1949 even after that date, there being no variation in the rates charged.	None
On October 1, 1949 the position was this.	None
The Bombay Act of 1946 having lapsed by efflux of time, the previous charge which was 33 1/3 in excess of the maxima permitted could not be continued unless recourse was had to the provisions of paragraph I of Sch.	None
VI of the Supply Act of 1948.	None
It was not suggested that on or before that day there was any conscious act on the part of the appellant to determine (a) the clear profit on the basis formulated in Sch.	None
VI and (b) an adjustment of its rates so as not to exceed the amount of the reasonable return permitted by paragraph I of that Schedule.	None
In this connection there was some debate in the courts below as to the date the Appellants license came to be governed by the provisions of S. 57(1) and the VIth Schedule.	None
Section 57(a) fixes the period from which licenses previously in existence would be governed by Sch.	None
VI as the commencement of the licensees next succeeding year of account.	None
The controversy was as to the period which would be the date of the commencement of the Appellants next succeeding year of account.	None
Two possible interpretations were suggested of this provision (1) As the year of account of the Appellant was the financial year it was contended on behalf of the respondents that the Act became applicable to it from April 1, 1949 onwards the contention on the side of the Appellant being that it became applicable only on April 1, 1950 but for the purposes of the cases before us it makes little difference, because assuming that S. 57 and the Supply Act 1948 became applicable to the Appellant from April 1, 1950 onwards, still the same question would arise as to whether at the commencement of that year the requirements of paragraph I of the VIth Schedule had been complied with.46.	None
The material words of paragraph I of the VIth Schedule are The licensee shall so adjust his rates.	None
The normal interpretation of these words would imply that there should be a conscious act on the part of the licensee, for the Act and the Schedule for the first time specified the criteria for determining the maximum profit that shall be made by a company and gave elaborate calculations as to how the clear profit and the reasonable return were to be computed and determined.	None
It is, however, possible to read the paragraph as meaning that it was only in those cases where either an increase or a decrease of the charge was necessary in order to ensure (a) that a licensee obtained a reasonable return or that the profit that he made exceeded or fell below the amount of reasonable return that the rates had to be modified.	None
In other words, where no change is needed, it might be presumed that no adjustment was needed.	None
In view of the machinery that it provided for complaints in the event of the licensee deriving more than a reasonable return as contemplated by the VIth Schedule we consider that the failure consciously to adjust the rates by working out the details so as to reach at the same rate as was charged previously does not constitute a failure to adjust the rates as required by Paragraph 1.47.	Reasoning
This leads us to the further questions (1) as to whether assuming that the rates had been adjusted by the licensee as required by Paragraph I and the licensee is charging the rates so adjusted whether the rates now charged (a) for lights and fans, and (b) as standing charges for the supply of motive power, could be successfully impugned as not conforming to the requirements of the VIth Schedule, (2) and closely related to this, and that is the third question we have specified earlier, whether having regard to the provisions contained in Ss. 57 and 57A of the Supply Act.	Issue
Civil Court would have jurisdiction to entertain a suit for the reliefs claimed in the present plaints.48.	None
Taking up, first, the question of lights and fans (and the standing charges for the supply of power would be governed by similar considerations)	None
the position would be that the Appellant must be deemed to have adjusted his rates under Paragraph 1 of the VIth Schedule when after the lapse of the Bombay Act of 1946 it continued to levy the same charges.	Reasoning
When in 1949 or 1950 it is deemed to have adjustment, Paragraph I which empowered it to make this adjustment contained a proviso which we shall recallProvided that the licensee shall not be considered to have failed so to adjust his rates if the clear profit in any year of account has not exceeded by more than 30 per cent of the amount of the reasonable return.	None
The proviso, no doubt, uses a double negative not be considered to have failed but expressed in positive terms it would mean that where the licensee adjusted his rates so that his clear profit exceeds by more than 30 per cent the reasonable return to which it was entitled, it could not be said to have adjusted his rates.	Reasoning
In other words, such an adjustment would not be an adjustment at all as is contemplated by Paragraph 1.	Reasoning
Paragraph 2 of the VIth Schedule proceeds on the basis that there is an adjustment within Paragraph 1 in other words, that the rate charged would yield to the licensee a clear profit which would not exceed the reasonable return by more than 30 per cent.	Reasoning
It is only on that basis that the percentages specified in Paragraph 2 could be properly appreciated, for it proceeds to take the excess over the reasonable return, divide it by 3 and of that 1/3rd allot a proportion not exceeding 7 1/2over to the licensee himself.	Reasoning
Of the balance half is to be appropriated to the Tariffs and Dividend Control Reserve and the other half is directed to be given to the consumers by granting them proportional rebates.	Reasoning
From the percentages named in Para II read in conjunction with the absolute prohibition against a rate which would yield more than 30 over the reasonable return it appears to us that the lawfully adjusted rate contemplated by Paragraph 1 is one where the amount of clear profit does not exceed the reasonable return by more than the maximum specified i.e., 30 per cent.	Reasoning
The other paragraphs of the VIth Schedule deal with the creation and disposal of certain funds and reserves to which it is not necessary to refer.49.	Reasoning
We thus reach the position that there could be a unilateral adjustment of the rates by a licensee but that such an adjustment must not leave him with more than the reasonable return plus another 30 per cent, this being an absolute limitation on the power to adjust.	Reasoning
Where the amount of reasonable return is exceeded Paragraph 2 comes into play and the excess over the reasonable return is distributed in the manner laid down in that paragraph.50.	None
We have next to consider the effect of the amendment to Para 1 of the VIth Schedule brought about by Central Act 101 of 1956 by which the maximum rate permitted to a licensee became reduced from one which yielded him not more than 30 per cent beyond the reasonable return to one which yielded him not more than 15.	None
The result of this would obviously be that there should have been a further adjustment by licensees so as to conform to the revised pattern.	None
Here again, the question would arise whether there should be a conscious readjustment.	Reasoning
Applying the rule of construction we have explained, earlier in relation to adjustment in 1949 or 1950 it would be seen that if the rate previously charged yielded a profit over the reasonable return of 15 or less there need be no readjustment and if the rate charged yields more than this permitted profit there should be a readjustment.	Reasoning
The result would, therefore, be that unless it is established that the rate, charged by the Appellant for lights and fans and for the standing monthly charge for supply of power resulted in a profit to it of more than 15 over the reasonable return, the Appellant would be held to have properly adjusted these rates in conformity with the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Supply Act as amended by Act 101 of 1956.51.	Reasoning
We shall, when dealing with the question relating to the jurisdiction of a Civil Court to entertain suits relating to infractions by licensees of their obligations under Para 1 of the VIth Schedule which is the last of the matters debated before us, also examine the question as to the party on whom the burden of proof would lie to establish that the adjustment which is made or which could be deemed to be made by a licensee by the continuance of a preexisting rate contravenes the statutory provisions.52.	Reasoning
Coming next to the unit charge for supply for power, the impugned rate was that which had been stepped up from that which had been continued from before September 1949, by action taken in compliance with the 3rd proviso to Para 1 of Schedule VI as amended by Act 101 of 1956.	None
The licensee notified to the consumers on September 25, 1958 his intention to enhance the unit rate for the supply of power.	None
Previous thereto in terms of that proviso a notice in writing had been issued to the State Government intimating its intention to enhance the rate, and thereafter the consumers were notified of this increase in rates.	Reasoning
It would be seen that the 3rd proviso to para I requires a notice to the State Government of the intention of the licensee to enhance the rates.	Reasoning
On August 7, 1958 the Appellant intimated the Government of Mysore setting out the clear profit it had made in 195758 and the estimated working position in 195859 and its intention to increase the unit rate for supply of power from 6 nP to 9 nP. unit.	Reasoning
Thereafter, on September 25, 1958, it notified the consumers that on and after November 1, 1958 it would be charging the enhanced unit rate together with the previously existing standing charges of Rs. 2.69 per B.H.P. per month.	Reasoning
The only point that was suggested as invalidating the notice to the Government was that the Government were not informed that the licensee was effecting an enhancement of the rates as regards the standing charges and that the notice was, therefore, bad.	Reasoning
We do not consider that there is any substance in this objection, Rs. 2.69 was the charge which had been made prior to the notice as standing charges and if, as we have held, that was the rate which must be deemed to have been adjusted and which the appellant was entitled to charge when Sch.	Reasoning
VI as it originally stood, the continuance of the same charge after the amendment of the Schedule would not make it an enhancement.53.	Reasoning
There is, however, one circumstance to which it is necessary to advert.	Reasoning
As already stated, the rate charged prior to the Supply Act, 1948 and which was continued thereafter would be a lawful rate only if the profit that it left to the licensee was less than 30 over the reasonable return.	Reasoning
This was the position when the Supply Act, 1948 came into force.	Reasoning
By reason of the amendment effected by Act 101 of 1956 the percentage of permissible profit was reduced to 15 and so the adjusted rate would be valid if it was within this permissible limit.	Reasoning
Unless the adjusted rate prior to the amendment of 1956 was in excess of 15 per cent permitted by the 1st proviso to paragraph 1 the continuance of such rate could not be objected to as an enhancement or as a violation of the paragraph 1 of the VI the Schedule.	Reasoning
The question as to the burden of proof as regards this requirement and whether the same has been discharged in these cases we shall reserve for later consideration.	Reasoning
Subject to this so far as regards the unit charge, the requirement of the third proviso to paragraph 1 was complied with.	Reasoning
There was thus no illegality or invalidity attaching to the notice to the Government issued under proviso 3 to paragraph 1 and the contention raised in that behalf by respondents must be rejected.54.	Reasoning
The question next to be examined is as to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to entertain the suits from which these appeals arise for the reliefs prayed for therein.	None
Section 57 of the Supply Act, 1948 which incorporates the VIth Schedule in the license of every licensee lays on obligation on the licensee to comply with the provisions of the said Schedule.	None
Then comes S. 57 A under which where the Board or the State Government, where there is no Board.	None
if satisfied that the licensee has failed to comply with any of the provisions of the VIth Schedule and shall when so requested by the licensee in writing, constitute a rating committee.	None
It is unnecessary to refer to the provisions relating to the procedure to be followed by the rating committee but it is sufficient to recall that the rating committee is empowered to fix the rates to be charged by licensees and the duty is cast on the rating committee to recommend a rate which would ensure to the licensee a clear profit sufficient to afford it a reasonable return as defined in the VIth Schedule during the next three years of account.	None
The provisions in S. 57A have to be read in conjunction with the last proviso to paragraph 1 of the VIth Schedule under which where the rates are fixed in pursuance of the recommendations of the rating committee and they are lower than those adjusted by the licensee under the Schedule, the licensee is directed to refund to the consumers the excess amount recovered by him from them.55.	None
The argument of the learned SolicitorGeneral was that as the Supply Act had by S. 57A made special provisions and created a special machinery for the determination of a proper rate to be charged by a licensee on its consumers, a suit in a civil court by the consumers for obtaining the same relief was impliedly barred.	None
The procedure prescribed by S. 57A was (1) where a consumer complained that a rate charged was excessively high he should first approach the Board or where there was no Board, the State Government,.	None
(2) the Board or the State Government should, on considering the complaint, be prima facie satisfied about the reasonableness of the complaint and it was in their discretion to appoint a rating committee, (3) If the Board or the State Government decided that it was not necessary to appoint a rating committee there was an end of the matter.	Arguments of Petitioner
If however, a committee was appointed the rating committee would take evidence and applying the provisions of the Act and the Schedule, would arrive at a rate which would yield the licensee an amount not less than the reasonable return that is provided for him under the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that this procedure was wholly incompatible with the continued existence of the jurisdiction of the civil court to determine any question as to whether a licensee had failed to comply with the requirements of Sch.	Arguments of Petitioner
VI and in particular as to the reasonableness of the rate to be charged.	Arguments of Petitioner
Besides, attention was also drawn to the last proviso to paragraph 1 of the VIth Schedule under which provision is made for refund to consumers in cases where an excess amount is collected from them beyond what was fixed as a reasonable rate by the rating committee.56.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is undoubted that these provisions have laid down a specific procedure for violations by the licensee of the requirements of Sch. VI.	Reasoning
There being no express bar to the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, we have to determine the scope and extent of the bar that could be implied from the existence of these provisions.	Reasoning
One thing, however, is clear the bar cannot extent beyond the scope and limits of the jurisdiction of the rating committee or expressed in other words, the jurisdiction of the civil court could not be held to be excluded in respect of those matters which are no assigned by S. 57A to the Rating Committee, or in regard to which the rating committee cannot afford the consumer relief against an infraction of a statutory provision by which he is aggrieved.57.	Reasoning
Before turning to the facts of the present case with a view to examine whether the relief sought by the respondents viz., a declaration and injunction could be granted by a civil court, we shall deal with the major argument of the learned SolicitorGeneral that for no infraction by a licensee of his obligations under the schedule could a suit be filed in a civil court.	Arguments of Petitioner
This was based on the words of S. 57 A (1) (a) (i) which empowers the Board or the State Government to appoint a rating committee if satisfied that the licensee has failed to comply with any of the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.58.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned SolicitorGeneral further contended that the provisions contained in S. 57A were wholly incompatible with the existence of a right in a consumer to move a civil court for obtaining a refund even of an illegal collection which the licensee is prohibited from charging.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was in this connection that he invited our attention to the provision for refund contained in the last proviso to paragraph I of Sch.	Arguments of Petitioner
VI and relying on this he submitted that the scheme of S. 57A could obviously not have contemplated a procedure by which one consumer went to a civil court and obtained redress, the civil court holding that the rate charged so far as the particular plaintiff was concerned was illegal and therefore entitling him to a refund of a particular sum while another consumer approached the Government who appointed a rating committee which arrived at a different rate and providing, if it did provide, for a different amount of refund.	Arguments of Petitioner
This is doubtless a serious argument which requires careful examination.	None
In this context and in support of this submission stress was laid on the words the licensee has failed to comply with any of the provisions of the Sixth Schedule occurring in S. 57, A (1) (a) (i) and it was urged that for any and every default of the licensee resort must be had to the Board or the Government and could not be had to the civil courts.	Reasoning
But from these provisions it does not in our opinion, follow that the jurisdiction of a civil court is barred in respect of the infraction of every obligation cast on a licensee by Sch. VI.	Reasoning
Broadly speaking, the utmost that could be urged would be that the bar to the jurisdiction of a civil court would be coextensive with and be restricted to the powers of the rating committee and the reliefs which the committee could grant under S. 57A.A few examples of breaches of Sch.	Reasoning
VI which a licensee may commit and in regard to which a reference to the rating committee is not contemplated would make our meaning clear.	Reasoning
The first proviso to paragraph 1 specifies that such rates shall not be enhanced more than once in any year of account.	Reasoning
Let us suppose that the licensee contravenes this prohibition and enhances the rate more than once.	Reasoning
There is no provision in S. 57A for the rating committee to control the licensee in the event of his transgressing a positive prohibition of this sort and, indeed, it would be most anomalous to say that the statute having made a provision that the rates shall not be enhanced more than once in a year, the consumer is left without a remedy if the Government does not choose to appoint a rating committee which, as we said earlier, has no power to afford redress to the affected consumer.	Reasoning
In such a case it appears to us that by no principle of construction can the jurisdiction of a civil court to grant a declaration and an injunction be denied.	Reasoning
It would also follow that if that rate is collected, the court could order a refund of the illegal collection.	Reasoning
Take next the case where a licensee in contravention of the 3rd proviso enhances the rates for the supply of electricity without giving the requisite notice of his intention to the Government and to the Board.	Reasoning
Here again, the rating committee does not come into the picture for preventing the continued charging of the rates in contravention of the 3rd proviso and here we consider it impossible to contend that the jurisdiction of the civil court to grant a declaration and an injunction are affected by the provisions of S. 57A.We therefore arrive at this position that notwithstanding the generality of the words in S. 57A (1) (a) (i) referring to the failure on the part of the licensee in complying with the requirements of the Sixth Schedule, there are some failures in regard to which the jurisdiction of the civil court is it is clear not barred.59.	Reasoning
The next question would be whether the same principle is not applicable to a case where the 2nd proviso is contravened i. e., where the licensee so adjusts his rates as to yield him a profit beyond 15 over the reasonable return.	None
The proviso casts an absolute obligation on the licensee not to exceed this limit.	None
There is thus a statutory prohibition against the licensee of fixing a rate which would yield such excessive profit, and if he does so he would not be acting in terms of the VIth Schedule at all or by virtue of a power conferred by that Schedule and therefore he would be amenable to the jurisdiction of the court which would be competent to issue an injunction restraining him from charging that rate.	Reasoning
No doubt, the proviso also adds that if he does so he would be failing to comply with the requirement of the main part of paragraph 1.	Reasoning
It would therefore follow that in a case where in adjusting his rate the licensee fixes it so high as to contravene this proviso, it would be open to the aggrieved consumer to approach the Board or the State Government to appoint a rating committee.	Reasoning
But from this circumstance we are not prepared to hold (a) that the action of the licensee in charging a prohibited rate is any the less and illegality not countenanced by the statute and (b) that where such an illegality is made out the jurisdiction of a civil court to afford relief is ousted.	Reasoning
It is possible to hold, and we do not desire to express a final opinion on a point which is not directly involved in these appeals, that the jurisdiction of the court may be confined to granting a declaration as to the invalidity of the adjustment and injunction against the violation of the statutory prohibitions and not to grant a refund.	Reasoning
It is only necessary to add that the relief sought in these two suits was merely a declaration regarding the invalidity of the rates charged and an injunction restraining the appellant from continuing to charge them.60.We are, therefore, satisfied that the mere existence of S. 57A does not by itself and without reference to the particular violation complained of by the licensee, bar the jurisdiction of a civil court and the argument in the extreme form presented to us by the learned SolicitorGeneral must be rejected.61.	Reasoning
The next and the last question that arises is whether the respondents have established that the appellant has violated any of the provisions of the Supply Act and in particular those contained in Sch.	None
VI Paragraph 1 of the Supply Act.	Issue
We have already dealt with the objection that there was no adjustment of rates in 1949 or 1950.	None
Again, we have already held that in regard to the unit rate for power into which alone there was an enhancement there was a valid notice issued to Government as required by the 3rd proviso to paragraph 1.	None
In the circumstances of this case the only ground upon which the respondents would have been entitled to the relief of declaration and injunction that they claimed was they had established that the rate charged by the Appellant offended the second proviso, in that it yielded a profit in excess of 15 per cent of the reasonable return.	None
The learned Judge in the High Court has held that the onus of proving that the rate which the Appellant charged was within this limit was on it and that as no evidence had been led by it on this point he granted the plaintiffs the declaration and injunction they sought.	None
We consider that the learned Judge was in error in this respect.	None
There is no presumption that the rate charged by a licensee contravenes the statutory prohibition.	None
It is for the party who alleges his right to relief to establish the facts upon which such relief could be obtained.	None
It was, therefore, for the plaintiffs to prove by facts placed before the court that the rate charged offended the statutory provision.	None
This they admittedly failed to do and we, therefore, hold that they were not entitled to the declaration and injunction which the learned Judge of the High Court granted.62.	None
We accordingly allow the appeals and direct the dismissal of the suits.	Decision
The appellant would be entitled to its costs here and in the High Court  one hearing fee.63.	Decision
Appeal allowed.	None
