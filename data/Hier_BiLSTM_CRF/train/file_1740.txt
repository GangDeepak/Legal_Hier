Facts
From the information furnished by the complainant informant, it transpired that out of 139 items supplied by the appellants, 119 were trousers and the balance 20 were blazers and suits.9.	Facts

On the basis of the aforementioned complaint, the Commission arrived at the conclusion that the appellants had indulged in restrictive trade practice within the meaning of sections 2(o)(ii) and 33(1)(b) of the MRTP Act.13.	Facts
The Commission further observed that the termination of the dealership or appellants refusal to deal with a well established retailer was bound to have an adverse effect and impact on competition in so far as it would reduce the number of retail dealers in the local market and thus would have the effect of restricting and lessening of the competition in the sale and supply of readymade garments and, therefore, would also be prejudicial to public interest.	Facts
It was further observed that by restricting and reducing the supply of ready to wear garments would also attract the provisions of section 2(o)(ii) of the MRTP Act.14.	Facts
The Commission directed the appellants to cease the aforementioned restrictive trade practice forthwith and furnish an undertaking that they shall not repeat or indulge in same or similar trade practices in future.	Facts
The Commission further directed the appellants to file an affidavit of compliance within six weeks of the pronouncement of the order.15.	Facts
The appellants, aggrieved by the said order of the Commission, preferred this appeal.	Facts
The appellants submitted that the complaint filed by the retail dealer cannot be dealt with under section 10(a)(i) of the MRTP Act since a complaint thereunder could not be entertained from a retail dealer who was not a consumer.	None
Section 10(a) (i) (iv) of the MRTP Act reads as under Inquiry into monopolistic or restrictive trade practices by Commission.	None
The Commission may enquire into (a) any restrictive trade practice (i) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such practice from any trade association or from any consumer or a registered consumers association, whether such consumer is a member of that consumers association or not or(ii) (iii) (iv) upon its own knowledge or information.	None
It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that a complaint under the said provisions could only be filed by any trade association, or from any consumer or a registered consumers association, the said complaint was treated as information and dealt with by the Commission under section 10(a)(iv) upon its own knowledge or information and a suo motu enquiry was initiated in respect of the aforesaid allegation of tieup of sales.18.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the appellants, the allegation of tie up of sales is to be considered in the light of the above provisions of the MRTP Act, before any order directing that such practice shall be discontinued and shall not be repeated, can be passed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such an order is also referred to as a cease and desist order.	Arguments of Petitioner
For passing such an order under section 37 of the MRTP Act, the followings have to be established(i) That the evidence clearly establishes that a practice of tie up of sales of trousers as a condition of sales and supply of other garments like blazers, coats, safaris, suits was insisted upon.(ii) That the aforesaid trade practice, in fact, had the effect of restricting or distorting competition within the meaning of section 2(o) of the MRTP Act.(iii) That such competition is affected to a material degree in the relevant trade and industry.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the appellants, It is only when the above aspects have been established that an order of cease and desist can be passed under section 37 of the MRTP Act.19.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the appellants, on the basis of the record, none of the above conditions is satisfied in the present case.	Arguments of Petitioner
The evidence of the sole witness produced by the respondent, being Viren Shah, partner of M s Roop Milan, the complainant retail dealer, would show that even the allegation of tie up of sales of trousers as a condition for sale of other garments like blazers, coats, safaris, suits has not been established.	None
On the contrary, the evidence of the said witness establishes that there was no tie up, as alleged.	None
In fact, the evidence shows that all readymade garments manufactured by appellant no. 2 were in short supply since it could not expand its manufacturing capacity due to licensing controls.	None
When all items are in demand and are in short supply, there cannot be any question of tie up of sales, which is resorted to for the purpose of selling an unwanted item along with an item having high demand.	None
The appellants submitted that the sole witness produced by respondent no. 1 who had the carriage of proceedings in a suo motu enquiry under section 10(a)(iv), it is clear that trousers were supplied as ordered.	Arguments of Petitioner
The supply of trousers was not tiedup with the supply of other garments like blazers, suits etc.	Arguments of Petitioner
As such, there is no justification for any finding of tieup of sales.22.	None
The appellants referred to the evidence produced by P. H. Hiranandani, Sales Manager.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was stated as under It may be clarified that the manufacture of readymade garments is reserved for the small scale sector in India and accordingly the second respondent is not in a position to meet the market demand for its readymade garments including trousers.	Arguments of Petitioner
All the readymade garments including the trousers manufactured and marketed by the second respondent enjoyed a good demand in the market.	Arguments of Petitioner
Dealers placed order and supplies of goods are made by the second respondent to the dealers depending upon the orders subject to availability of stocks.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the circumstances, the question of any alleged tieup sale of trousers with other garments like blazers, coats, safaris, cannot and does not arise.	Arguments of Petitioner
The evidence of P. H. Hiranandani reveals that all garments including trousers were in short supply and had great demand.	Reasoning
Therefore, the allegation that the supply of trousers had been tied up with any other garment for sale is without any basis.	Reasoning
The appellants also submitted that the allegation of tie up of sales is not established, in any event, it is submitted that section 2(o) of the MRTP Act relating to the existence of restrictive trade practice can only be invoked when as a result of the alleged practice, competition is in fact restricted or affected.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the absence of any such proof of competition having been restricted, no allegation of restrictive trade practice can be established.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of their submissions, the appellants have placed reliance on the judgment of this court in Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Ltd., Bombay v. Registrar of the Restrictive Trade Agreement, New Delhi (1977) 2 SCC 55.	None
In this case, the scope of restrictive trade practice, as defined under section 2(o) of the MRTP Act, has been considered by this court.	None
The practice of imposing territorial restriction and exclusive dealings in the agreements with dealers were considered in the context of section 2(o) of the MRTP Act.	None
It was alleged that the restriction not to deal outside the prescribed territory and not to deal with competing products was a restriction which affected and restricted competition within the meaning of section 2(o) of the MRTP Act.	None
This court, while dealing with these allegations applied the rule of reason while dealing with the scope of section 2(o) of the MRTP Act and not the doctrine that any restriction as to area will per se be a Restrictive Trade Practice.	None
The relevant portion of para 29 reads as under Every trade agreement restrains or binds persons or places or prices.	None
The question is whether the restraint is such as regulates and thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.	None
To determine this question three matters are to be considered.	None
First, what facts are peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied.	None
Second, what was the condition before and after the restraint is imposed.	None
Third, what is the nature of the restraint and what is its actual and probable effect.	None
In para 37 of the said judgment, it was held that the area restriction did not constitute Restrictive Trade Practice.	None
In para 56 it was observed as under The question of competition cannot be considered in vacuo or in a doctrinaire spirit.	None
The concept of competition is to be understood in a commercial sense.	None
Territorial restriction will promote competition whereas the removal of territorial restriction would reduce competition It was further observed in para 59 that In the present case the restriction imposed by Telco on dealers not to sell bus and chassis outside their territories does not restrict competition for the foregoing reasons.	None
With regard to exclusive dealings, this court further observed in para 60 as under The other term of exclusive dealership in Clauses 6 and 14 of the agreement between Telco and the dealers that the dealer will not sell commercial vehicles of other manufacturers, does not amount to a restriction in competition because other manufacturers can appoint other persons to deal in their commercial vehicles.	None
It is also in public interest to see that vehicles of other manufacturers are sold in the same territory by other dealers.	None
Therefore, there will be competition between the manufacturers of different commercial vehicles and as far as exclusive dealership of Telco commercial vehicles is concerned, it will be in public interest and not be a restriction in competition.	None
With regard to territorial restriction and exclusive dealings, this court held in para 61 that these conditions were not prejudicial to public interest and that both these restrictions were in public interest.	Reasoning
The appellants have also relied upon the judgment of this court in the case of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. v. Union of India Another (1979) 2 SCC 529 and laid stress on paras 14 and 15 of the said judgment.	None
Clause (h) of section 38(1) of the MRTP Act provides that it is only when the restriction directly or indirectly restricts or discourages competition to any material degree in any relevant trade or industry that such restriction would be considered as prejudicial to public interest.	None
In a case where the alleged restrictive trade practice does not have the impact of restricting competition to any material degree in any relevant trade or industry, such trade practice cannot be considered as prejudicial to public interest and no order of cease and desist can be passed under section 37 of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similarly, for invoking section 38(1)(h) of the MRTP Act to show that in any event, it could not be said that competition was affected to any material degree in the relevant trade or industry, the appellants witness Pradeep H. Hiranandani has clarified in para 8 of the affidavit of evidence that in view of the negligible market share of the appellants in the relevant trade, it cannot be even alleged that the competition was affected to any material degree.	Reasoning
The relevant portion of the evidence of Pradeep H. Hiranandani reads as under I say and submit that there are several manufacturers of readymade garments in India including several small scale manufacturersin the circumstances, the market share of the second respondent is very negligible in the relevanttrade in India and accordingly circumstances exist within the meaning of section 38(1)(h) of the Act The appellants submitted that the Commission did not even consider the aforesaid aspect that in the present case competition was not affected to any material degree and as such it could not be held that the alleged Restrictive Trade Practice was prejudicial to public interest, keeping in view clause (h) of section 38(1) of the MRTP Act.	None
The gateway contemplated under clause (h) was specifically pleaded by the appellants and was supported by positive evidence, but the said evidence was not even considered in the impugned order.	None
This itself vitiates the order.	None
Reference to section 38(1)(h) was necessary in order to arrive at the finding relating to the practice being prejudicial to public interest.	None
The learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents referred to section 33(1)(b) of the MRTP Act.	None
Section 33 only deals with Agreements relating to Restrictive Trade Practices.	None
In the present case, there is no allegation of any Agreement entered into between the parties, either oral or in writing under which any practice of tieup sales was specified.	None
As such, section 33 has no relevance to the present case.	Reasoning
The appellants further submitted that even in cases where section 33 may be invoked, before passing an order of cease and desist under section 37, it would still be necessary to determine whether the alleged restrictive trade practice is prejudicial to public interest within the meaning of section 38 of the MRTP Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
In a case where the alleged restrictive trade practice does not restrict competition to any material degree in the relevant trade or industry, it could not be considered as prejudicial to public interest and no order under section 37 can be passed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned senior counsel for the respondents referred to the preliminary investigation report submitted by the Director General (IR).	Arguments of Respondent
The preliminary investigation report cannot be taken into consideration as it is not produced in evidence.	Arguments of Respondent
It is only a report submitted in terms of Section 11 of the MRTP Act for initiating the enquiry.	Arguments of Respondent
Only those facts contained therein, which are proved on record by evidence, can be looked into.	Arguments of Respondent
The preliminary investigation report, as such, is not evidence on record.	Arguments of Respondent
As such, any reference to the contents thereof, which have not been put in evidence and subjected to cross examination, cannot be looked into.	Arguments of Respondent
This is without prejudice to the contention that there is nothing stated in the preliminary investigation report, which in any way establishes that any competition was affected within the meaning of section 2(o) of the Act and that competition was affected to any material degree in the relevant trade or industry, as contemplated under clause (h) of section 38(1) of the Act.37.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellants submitted that the findings given by the Commission that the dealership of the complainant was terminated by the appellants herein and held it to be a restrictive trade practice, was wholly uncalled for and untenable.38.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants submitted that no finding with regard to termination of dealership could be made since there was no such charge or allegation made in the Notice of Enquiry.	Arguments of Petitioner
A reference has been made to the case of M s. Lakhanpal National Ltd. v. MRTP Commission and Another (1989) 3 SCC 251 .	Arguments of Petitioner
This court in para 9 of the said judgment observed as under The argument was rightly repelled on behalf of the appellant on the ground that this aspect cannot be examined in the present case in view of the limited scope of the charges as mentioned in the Show Cause Notice quoted above.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants contended that since there was no allegation of restrictive trade practice on account of the alleged termination of the agreement, no order in respect thereof could be passed by the Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
The order passed in respect of the same is clearly illegal and without jurisdiction.40.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants further contended that, in any event, the evidence in the present case clearly establishes that the complainant firm M s Roop Milan had itself asked for return of its security deposit from appellant No.2, which was duly returned and thereafter, there was no dealing between the parties.	Arguments of Petitioner
As such, there can be no case of termination of dealership.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said complainant firm was mainly dealing with the products of other manufacturers and out of its total turnover of Rs.25 lakhs per annum, its purchases from appellant no. 2 was only to the extent of Rs.50,000 per annum.	Arguments of Petitioner
In these circumstances, the said complainant firm did not desire to continue to deal with the appellants products and as such sought refund of its security deposit, which was duly made.	Arguments of Petitioner
The relevant extract in this behalf from the evidence of Viren Singh, partner of the complainant firm is reproduced as under It is correct that in our letter we had asked a refund of the security deposit which was refunded to us by the respondent no. 2 along with their aforesaid letter dated 28.9.1987.	None
In fact we received the refund as per memo dated 28.9.1987.	None
It is not a letter as such and this is Exh.	None
AW1/R18.	None
The appellants submitted that, in any event, mere termination of dealership agreement does not affect competition within the meaning of section 2(o) of the MRTP Act and cannot be treated as a Restrictive Trade Practice.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the termination, if any, of a single retail dealer cannot affect competition to any material degree in the relevant trade or industry, within the meaning of clause (h) of section 38(1) of the Act.42.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants submitted that the Commission was not justified in passing any order regarding termination of dealership.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants also submitted that appellant no. 1 is only a holding company of which appellant no. 2 is a subsidiary company.	Arguments of Petitioner
There is no transaction of sale or dealing by appellant no. 1.	Arguments of Petitioner
No manufacturing or selling activity is carried out by appellant no. 1 and as such, no tieup of sales could be resorted to by appellant no. 1.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the Commission was not justified in passing any order against appellant no. 1.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants submitted that the impugned order of the Commission ought to be set aside and the notice of enquiry be discharged.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have carefully gone through the entire record in this case and heard the learned counsel for the parties at length.	Reasoning
From the proper analysis of the entire evidence on record, we reach to an irresistible conclusion that no tieup of sales of trousers as a condition has been established.	Reasoning
Therefore, the Commissions passing any consequential order on the basis of tieup is wholly untenable and unsustainable in law.44.	Reasoning
The court would be justified in passing the order on alleged restrictive trade practice only when it is prejudicial to public interest under clause (h) of section 38(1) of the MRTP Act.	Reasoning
The precondition for passing such an order is that the restriction as imposed directly or indirectly when restricts or discourages competition to any material degree in any trade or industry, then only it would be considered as prejudicial to public interest.	Reasoning
The court should not pass an order of cease and desist where the alleged restrictive trade practice does not have the impact on restricting competition to any material degree.45.	Reasoning
When the evidence on behalf of the appellants clearly shows that there are several manufacturers including small scale manufactures, the little share of the complainant informant does not affect the competition in the relevant trade or industry and, accordingly, in these circumstances, to pass any order under section 38(1)(h) cannot be justified.46.	Reasoning
In the instant case, the complainant informant had requested for refund of the security amount and, therefore, it was refunded.	Reasoning
It was really not a case of termination of dealership.	Reasoning
There was no charge or allegation of termination of dealership in the notice of enquiry, therefore, the Commission was not justified in passing the order based on termination of dealership.	Reasoning
Even otherwise also, the termination of single dealership cannot affect competition to any material degree in the relevant trade or industry within the meaning of clause (h) of section 38(1) of the MRTP Act.47.	Reasoning
On consideration of the totality of the facts and circumstances, the appeal is allowed and the impugned order passed by the Commission is accordingly set aside.	Decision
The Notice of Enquiry is also discharged.	Decision
In the facts and circumstances of the case, the parties are directed to bear their own costs.	Decision
