 M. Lodha, J. Two contracts were entered into between the appellants and the respondents  (i) for construction of Tezpur Town Water Supply Scheme and (ii) for construction of Tinsukia Town Water Supply Scheme.	Facts
Certain disputes arose between the parties concerning these contracts and to resolve such disputes, sole arbitrator was appointed by the Chief Justice of Gauhati High Court on March 26, 2002 under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, 1996 Act).	Facts
On May 10, 2002 the appellants filed application under Section 16 of the 1996 Act questioning the jurisdiction of the sole arbitrator as according to the appellants there was no arbitration clause in the agreement.	Facts
This application came to be rejected by the sole arbitrator.2.	Facts
Thereafter, the sole arbitrator proceeded with the arbitration and passed two awards in relation to the above contracts in favour of the respondents on August 22, 2003.	Facts
The awards were received by the appellants on August 26, 2003.	Facts
On January 2, 2004, the appellants made two applications for setting aside the awards dated August 22, 2003 under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.	Facts
These applications were accompanied by two separate applications for extension of time under Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.3.	Facts
The District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati, dismissed the appellants applications under Section 34 of the 1996 Act on June 1, 2004 and June 5, 2004 on the ground of limitation.4	Facts
The appellants challenged the above orders of the Districted Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati, in the Gauhati High Court in two separate Arbitration Appeals, being Arbitration Appeal Nos. 6 of 2004 and 7 of 2004.	Facts
The Division Bench of that Court upheld the view of the District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati and dismissed the above Arbitration Appeals.	Facts
Mr. Bijender Singh, learned counsel for the appellants, submitted that the Division Bench gravely erred in applying the decision of this Court in Union of India Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Popular Construction Co. ((2001) 8 SCC 470 ) to the facts of the present case.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the judgment of this Court in Popular Construction Co. (supra) was rendered on the question of applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (for short, 1963 Act) and has no application to the peculiar facts of the present case where extension was sought by the appellants under Section 4 of the 1963 Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of his argument, Mr. Bijender Singh, learned counsel, referred to Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act that defines period of limitation and Section 43 of the 1996 Act that makes the 1963 Act applicable to arbitration matters.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that the High Court did not commit any error in upholding the view of the District Judge, Kamarup, Guwahati.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the learned senior counsel, the High Courts view is consistent with Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act, particularly proviso (3) thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act provides that an application for setting aside an award may be made within three months of the receipt of the arbitral award.	Reasoning
The proviso that follows subsection (3) of Section 34 provides that on sufficient cause being shown, the court may entertain the application for setting aside the award after the period of three months and within a further period of 30 days but not thereafter.	None
In Popular Construction Co. (supra), this Court has held that an application for setting aside an award filed beyond the period mentioned in Section 34(3) would not be an application in accordance with subsection (3) as required under Section 34(1) of the 1996 Act and Section 5 of the 1963 Act has no application to such application.	None
In para 12 of the report, it was held in Popular Construction Co. (supra) thus As far as the language of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial words are but not thereafter used in the proviso to subsection (3).	None
In our opinion, this phrase would amount to an express exclusion within the meaning of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, and would therefore bar the application of Section 5 of the Act.	None
Parliament did not need to go further.	None
To hold that the court could entertain an application to set aside the award beyond the extended period under the proviso, would render the phrase but not thereafter wholly otiose.	None
No principle of interpretation would justify such a result Recently, in the State of Maharashtra Vs.	None
Hindustan Construction Company Limited ((2010) 4 SCC 518 ), a two Judge Bench of this Court speaking through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) emphasised the mandatory nature of the limit to the extension of the period provided in proviso to Section 34(3) and held that an application for setting aside arbitral award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act has to be made within the time prescribed under subsection (3) of Section 34, i.e., within three months and a further period of 30 days on sufficient cause being shown and not thereafter.	Reasoning
Section 43(1) of the 1996 Act provides that the 1963 Act shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to proceedings in court.	None
The 1963 Act is thus applicable to the matters of arbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and except to the extent its applicability has been excluded by virtue of the express provision contained in Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.	None
The facts in the present case are peculiar.	Reasoning
The arbitral awards were received by the appellants on August 26, 2003.	Reasoning
No application for setting aside the arbitral awards was made by the appellants before elapse of three months from the receipt thereof.	Reasoning
As a matter of fact, three months from the date of the receipt of the arbitral award by the appellants expired on November 26, 2003.	Reasoning
The District Court had Christmas vacation for the period from December 25, 2003 to January 1, 2004.	Reasoning
On reopening of the court, i.e., on January 2, 2004, admittedly, the appellants made applications for setting aside those awards under Section 34 of the 1996 Act.	Reasoning
If the period during which the District Court, Kamrup, Guwahati, remained closed during Christmas vacation, 2003 is extended and the appellants get benefit of that period over and above the cap of thirty days as provided in Section 34(3), then the view of the High Court and the District Judge cannot be sustained.	Reasoning
But this would depend on the applicability of Section 4 of the 1963 Act.	None
The question, therefore, that falls for our determination is  whether the appellants are entitled to extension of time under Section 4 of the 1963 Act in the above facts.	Issue
Section 4 of the 1963 Act reads as under  Expiry of prescribed period when court is closed.	Reasoning
Where the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or application expires on a day when the court is closed, the suit, appeal or application may be instituted, preferred or made on the day when the court reopens.	Reasoning
Explanation.	Reasoning
A court shall be deemed to be closed on any day within the meaning of this section if during any part of its normal working hours it remains closed on that day.	Reasoning
The above Section enables a party to institute a suit, prefer an appeal or make an application on the day court reopens where the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or application expires on the day when the court is closed.	Reasoning
The crucial words in Section 4 of the 1963 Act are prescribed period.	Reasoning
What is the meaning of these words?Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act defines period of limitation which means the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by the Schedule, and prescribed period means the period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.	Reasoning
Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act when read in the context of Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act, it becomes amply clear that the prescribed period for making an application for setting aside arbitral award is three months.	Reasoning
The period of 30 days mentioned in proviso that follows subsection (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is not the period of limitation and, therefore, not prescribed period for the purposes of making the application for setting aside the arbitral award.	Reasoning
The period of 30 days beyond three months which the court may extend on sufficient cause being shown under the proviso appended to subsection (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act being not the period of limitation or, in other words, prescribed period, in our opinion, Section 4 of the 1963 Act is not, at all, attracted to the facts of the present case.	Reasoning
Seen thus, the applications made by the appellants on January 2, 2004, for setting aside the arbitral award dated August 26, 2003 were liable to be dismissed and have rightly been dismissed by the District Judge, Kamrup, Guwahati, as time barred.	None
The dismissal of the Arbitration Appeals (6 of 2004 and 7 of 2004) by the High Court, thus, cannot be legally flawed for the reasons we have indicated above.	None
The Appeal has no force and is dismissed with no order as to costs.	Decision
