According to the plaintiffs, though they were parties to the award along with defendants in Civil Suit No. 481/2007	None
but since the award dated 22.08.2007 was obtained by the parties by misrepresenting the facts to the plaintiffs which was nothing short of fraud played by the defendants on them to grab their more land without their knowledge and taking advantage of their illiteracy, the same is not a legal award and hence not binding on the plaintiffs.	Facts
On these averments, the plaintiffs prayed that the award dated 22.08.2007 be declared illegal, void, inoperative and not binding on the plaintiffs.	None

17) Heard Mr. Dushyant Dave and Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the appellants and Mr. B. Adinarayana, learned senior counsel, Mr. D. Mahesh Babu, Mr. Pranab Mullick, Mr. Ejaz Maqbool for the respondents.	None
18)	None
Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellants (defendants) while assailing the legality and correctness of the impugned order argued only one legal point.	Arguments of Petitioner
He urged that the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the Trial Court was right whereas the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the High Court was not so and hence the Trial Courts order deserves to be restored.	Arguments of Petitioner
19) Elaborating his submission, Mr. Dushyant Dave placed reliance on the law laid down by this Court in State of Punjab (supra) and contended that the issue urged by him no longer remains res integra and stands answered by this Court in appellants favour.	Arguments of Petitioner
20)	Arguments of Petitioner
It was his submission that the expression barred by any law occurring in clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 not only includes any Act enacted by the legislature creating a ?bar?	Arguments of Petitioner
but the expression ?law? includes therein ?	Arguments of Petitioner
judicial decision of the Supreme Court also, which are binding on all the Courts in the Country by virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution of India. 21)	Arguments of Petitioner
In other words, his submission was that the expression ?law?	Arguments of Petitioner
occurring in clause(d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 should be construed liberally so as to include therein not only any ?Act which is admittedly a ?law?	Arguments of Petitioner
made by the legislature but also include therein a a decision of Supreme Court .	Arguments of Petitioner
22) Learned counsel urged that the appellants (defendants) were, therefore, fully justified in invoking the powers under Order 7 Rule 11(d) of the Code praying for rejection of the plaint as being barred on the strength of law laid down by this Court in State of Punjab (supra).	Arguments of Petitioner
23)	None
In reply, learned counsel for the respondents while supporting the impugned order contended that the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the High Court is just and proper and hence does not call for any interference.	Arguments of Respondent

25)	None
The question arose before this Court (Three Judge Bench) in the case of State of Punjab (supra) as to what is the remedy available to the person aggrieved of the award passed by the Lok Adalat under Section 20 of the Act.	None
In that case, the award was passed by the Lok Adalat which had resulted in disposal of the appeal pending before the High Court relating to a claim case arising out of Motor Vehicle Act.	None
One party to the appeal felt aggrieved of the Award and, therefore, questioned its legality and correctness by filing a writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India.	None
The High Court dismissed the writ petition holding it to be not maintainable.	None
The aggrieved party, therefore, filed an appeal by way of special leave before this Court.	None
This Court, after examining the scheme of the Act allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court.	None
This Court held that the High Court was not right in dismissing the writ petition as not maintainable.	None
It was held that the only remedy available with the aggrieved person was to challenge the award of the Lok Adalat by filing a writ petition under Article 226 or and 227 of the Constitution of India in the High Court and that too on very limited grounds.	Reasoning
The case was accordingly remanded to the High Court for deciding the writ petition filed by the aggrieved person on its merits in accordance with law.	None
26)	None
This is what Their Lordships held in Para 12?12.	None
It is true that where an award is made by the Lok Adalat in terms of a settlement arrived at between the parties (which is duly signed by parties and annexed to the award of the Lok Adalat), it becomes final and binding on the parties to the settlement and becomes executable as if it is a decree of a civil court, and no appeal lies against it to any court.	None
If any party wants to challenge such an award based on settlement, it can be done only by filing a petition under Article 226 and or Article 227 of the Constitution, that too on very limited grounds.	None
But where no compromise or settlement is signed by the parties and the order of the Lok Adalat does not refer to any settlement, but directs the respondent to either make payment if it agrees to the order, or approach the High Court for disposal of appeal on merits, if it does not agree, is not an award of the Lok Adalat.	None
The question of challenging such an order in a petition under Article 227 does not arise.	None
As already noticed, in such a situation, the High Court ought to have heard and disposed of the appeal on merits.?27)	None
In our considered view, the aforesaid law laid down by this Court is binding on all the Courts in the country by virtue of mandate of Article 141 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
This Court, in no uncertain terms, has laid down that challenge to the award of Lok Adalat can be done only by filing a writ petition under Article 226 and or Article 227 of the Constitution of India in the High Court and that too on very limited grounds.	Reasoning
28)	None
In the light of clear pronouncement of the law by this Court, we are of the opinion that the only remedy available to the aggrieved person(respondents herein plaintiffs) was to file a writ petition under Article 226 and or 227 of the Constitution of India in the High Court for challenging the award dated 22.08.2007 passed by the Lok Adalat.	Facts
It was then for the writ Court to decide as to whether any ground was made out by the writ petitioners for quashing the award and, if so, whether those grounds are sufficient for its quashing.	None
29)	None
The High Court was, therefore, not right in by passing the law laid down by this Court on the ground that the suit can be filed to challenge the award, if the challenge is founded on the allegations of fraud.	None
In our opinion, it was not correct approach of the High Court to deal with the issue in question to which we do not concur.	None
30)	None
We also do not agree with the submissions of Mr. Adinarayana Rao, learned senior counsel for the respondents when he urged that firstly, the expression law occurring in clause(d) of Rule 11 Order 7 does not include the judicial decisions and clause (d) applies only to bar which is contained in ?the Act? enacted by the Legislature and Secondly, even if it is held to include the ?judicial decisions?, yet the law laid down in the case of State of Punjab (supra) cannot be read to hold that the suit is barred.	Reasoning
Both these submissions, in our view, have no merit. 31)	None
Blacks Law Dictionary (Ninth Edition) defines the expression law.	None
It says that ?	None
Law includes the ?judicial precedents (see at page 962).	None
Similarly, the expression law? defined in Jowett?s Dictionary of English Law (Third Edition Volume2, (pages 1304/1305) says that law is derived from judicial precedents, legislation or from custom.	None
When derived from judicial precedents, it is called common law, equity, or admiralty, probate or ecclesiastical law according to the nature of the Courts by which it was originally enforced.	None
32)	None
The question as to whether the expression law occurring in clause(d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 of the Code includes judicial decisions of the Apex Court came up for consideration before the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Virender Kumar Dixit vs. State of U.P., 2014(9) ADJ 1506.	None
The Division Bench dealt with the issue in detail in the context of several decisions on the subject and held in para 15 as under?15.	None
Law includes not only legislative enactments but also judicial precedents.	None
An authoritative judgment of the Courts including higher judiciary is also law.?33)	None
This very issue was again considered by the Gujarat High Court (Single Bench) in the case of Hermes Marines Limited vs. Capeshore Maritime Partners F.Z.C. Anr.	None
(unreported decision in Civil Application (OJ) No.144 of 2016 in Admiralty Suit No.10 of 2016 decided on 22.04.2016).	None
The learned Single Judge examined the issue and relying upon the decision of the Allahabad High Court quoted supra held in Para 53 as under?53.	None
In the light of the above discussion, in the considered view of this Court, it cannot be said that the term ?barred by any law?	None
occurring in clause(d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 of the Code, ought to be read to mean only the law codified in a legislative enactment and not the law laid down by the Courts in judicial precedents.	None
The judicial precedent of the Supreme Court in Liverpool London Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association vs. M.V. Sea Success, 2004(9) SCC 512 has been followed by the decision of the Division Bench in Croft Sales Distribution Ltd. vs. M.V. Basil, 2011(2) GLR 1027.	None
It is, therefore, the law as of today, which is that the Geneva Convention of 1999 cannot be made applicable to a contract that does not involve public law character.	None
Such a contract would not give rise to a maritime claim.	None
As discussed earlier, the word law?	None
as occurring in Order 7 Rule 11(d) would also mean judicial precedent.	None
If the judicial precedent bars any action that would be the law.?34)	None
Similarly, this very issue was again examined by the Bombay High Court (Single Judge) in Shahid s. Sarkar Ors.	None
Vs.	Facts
Usha Ramrao Bhojane, 2017 SCC OnLine Bom 3440.	None
The learned Judge placed reliance on the decisions of the Allahabad High Court in Virender Kumar Dixit vs. State of U.P. (Supra) and the Gujarat High Court in Hermes Marines Limited (supra) and held as under?18.The law laid down by the highest court of a State as well as the Supreme Court, is the law.	None
In fact, Article 141 of the Constitution of India categorically states that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all Courts within the territories of India.	None
There is nothing even in the C.P.C. to restrict the meaning of the words ?barred by any law?	None
to mean only codified law or statute law as sought to be contended by Mr. Patil.	None
In the view that I have taken, I am supported by a decision of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Hermes Marines Ltd? ?	None
19.	None
One must also not lose sight of the purpose and intention behind Order VII Rule 11(d).	None
The intention appears to be that when the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law, the Courts will not unnecessarily protract the litigation and proceed with the hearing of the suit.	None
The purpose clearly appears to be to ensure that where a Defendant is able to establish that the Plaint ought to be rejected on any of the grounds set out in the said Rule, the Court would be duty bound to do so, so as to save expenses, achieve expedition and avoid the court?s resources being used up on cases which will serve no useful purpose.	None
A litigation, which in the opinion of the court, is doomed to fail would not further be allowed to be used as a device to harass a Defendant?35)	None
Similarly, issue was again examined by the High Court of Jharkhand(Single Judge) in Mira Sinha Ors.	None
Vs.	Facts
State of Jharkhand Ors., 2015 SCC OnLine Jhar.4377.	None
The learned Judge, in paragraph 7 held as under?7.	None
In the background of the law laid down by the Hon?ble Supreme Court, it is apparent that Order VII Rule 11(d) C.P.C. application is maintainable only when the suit is barred by any law.	None
The expression ?law? included in Rule 11(d) includes Law of Limitation and, it would also include the law declared by the Hon?ble Supreme Court?36)	None
We are in agreement with the view taken by Allahabad, Gujarat, Bombay and Jharkhand High Courts in the aforementioned four decisions which, in our opinion, is the proper interpretation of the expression law occurring in clause (d) of Rule 11 of Order 7 of the Code.	Reasoning
This answers the first submission of the learned counsel for the respondents against the respondents.	None
37) So far as the second submission of learned counsel for the respondents is concerned, it also has no merit.	None
In our view, the decision rendered in the case of State of Punjab (supra) is by the larger Bench (Three Judge) and is, therefore, binding on us.	Reasoning
No efforts were made and rightly to contend that the said decision needs reconsideration on the issue in question.	Reasoning
That apart, when this Court has laid down a particular remedy to follow for challenging the award of Lok Adalat then in our view, the same is required to be followed by the litigant in letter and spirit as provided therein for adjudication of his grievance in the first instance.	Reasoning
The reason being that it is a law of the land under Article 141 of the Constitution of India (see  M. Nagaraj Ors.	Reasoning
Vs. U.O.I. Ors. 2006	Reasoning
( 8 ) SCC 212).	Reasoning
It is then for the writ court to decide as to what orders need to be passed on the facts arising in the case.	Reasoning
38)	None
In the light of foregoing discussion, we cannot concur with the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the High Court.	None
39)	None
As a result, the appeal succeeds and is allowed.	None
Impugned order is set aside and that of the order passed by the Trial Court is restored.	Decision
As a consequence, the application filed by the appellants (defendants) under Order 7 Rule 11 (d) of the Code is allowed resulting in rejection of the plaint.	None
40)	None
We, however, make it clear that the respondents (plaintiffs) would be at liberty to challenge the legality and correctness of the award dated 22.08.2007 passed by the Lok Adalat by filing the writ petition under Article 226 or and 227 of the Constitution in the High Court in accordance with law.	Reasoning
41)	None
We also make it clear that we have not examined the merits of case of either parties which is the subject matter of the suit and hence the writ court, in the event of writ petition being filed, would decide the writ petition strictly in accordance with law without being influenced by any of our observations.	None
