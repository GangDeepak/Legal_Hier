The rest of the appellant Nos. 1 and 2, the parents, were accepted as dependents.	None
The Tribunal taking into consideration the fact that the deceased was unmarried and 26 years old young man at the time of accident and his salary was Rs.99,000/ per annum, deducted 50 of the income and applying the multiplier of 17 as per the decision of this Court in Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation (2009) 6 SCC 121 held that the appellants are entitled to get compensation of Rs.8,66,000/. Rest of the issues were decided in favour of the appellants.	None

The High Court by impugned order dated 12.11.2010 reduced the compensation to Rs.6,68,000/ by applying the multiplier of 13 and observed as follows The impugned award of the Tribunal is liable to be modified as we feel that looking to the age of the deceased as 26 years, the multiplier of 13 was to be applied according to the decision of Honble the Apex Court in the case of Sarla Verma (Smt) and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Another, reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121 , but the learned Tribunal has applied the multiplier of 17.	None
Therefore, without changing the annual income and other amounts as awarded by the Tribunal on other heads, in our opinion, the multiplier of 13 would be appropriate in the instant case.	None
Thus the compensation towards dependency would come to Rs.6,43,500/ (Rs.49,500 X 13 6,43,500/).	None
Besides this amount, the claimants (father mother of deceased) are entitled to get Rs.10,000/ (each) (i.e. Rs.20,000/) on account of loss of love affection, Rs. 2,000/ on account of funeral expenses and Rs.2500/ on account of loss of estate as awarded by the Tribunal.	None
Therefore, the Total amount comes to Rs.6,68,000/ (Rs.6,43,500/ 20,000/2,000/2500/Rs.6,68,000/).	None
Therefore, the claimants are entitled to get the said amount of compensation instad of the amount as awarded by the Tribunal.	None
The claimants would be entitled to get interest 6 per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition.	Reasoning
Rest of the conditions mentioned in the impugned award shall remain intact.	None
Learned counsel appearing on behalf the appellants submitted that 50 deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased is totally disproportionate to the size of the his family and as the family of the deceased bachelor was large and there are three dependentnonearning members, the personal and living expenses ought to have been restricted to onethird and contribution to the family should have been taken as two third.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further submitted that the High Court committed serious error by applying multiplier of 13 which was against the law laid down by this Court in the case of Sarla Verma (supra).13. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondentsInsurance Company submitted that the deceasedRitesh Bhanu Shali was unmarried boy aged about 26 years and the High Court rightly applied the multiplier of 13 as per the age of the claimants, i.e. parents.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the respondents, the multiplier is to be applied as per the age of the deceased or as per the age of the claimant, whichever is higher but aforesaid submission cannot be accepted in view of the finding of this Court in the case of Sarla Verma (supra).14.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the respective arguments and perused the record.	None
The questions which arise for consideration are What should be the deduction for the personal and living expenses of the deceased Ritesh Bhanu Shali to decide the question of the contribution of the dependent members of the family and What is the proper selection of multiplier for deciding the claim.	None
The question relating to deduction for personal and living expenses and selection of multiplier fell for consideration before this Court in the case of Sarla Verma (Smt) and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121.	None
In the said case this Court taking into consideration the decisions in Kerala SRTC v. Susamma Thomas, (1994) 2 SCC 176 U.P. SRTC v. Trilok Chand, (1996)4 SCC 362 New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Charlie, (2005) 10 SCC 720 and Fakeerappa v. Karnataka Cement Pipe Factory, (2004) 2 SCC 473 , held as follows Re Question Deduction for personal and living expenses Though in some cases the deduction to be made towards personal and living expenses is calculated on the basis of units indicated in Trilok Chandra, the general practice is to apply standardised deductions.	None
Having considered several subsequent decisions of this Court, we are of the view that where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased, should be onethird (1/3rd) where the number of dependent family members is 2 to 3, onefourth (1/4th) where the number of dependent family members is 4 to 6, and onefifth (1/5th) where the number of dependent family members exceeds six.	None
Where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are the parents, the deduction follows a different principle.	None
In regard to bachelors, normally, 50 is deducted as personal and living expenses, because it is assumed that a bachelor would tend to spend more on himself.	None
Even otherwise, there is also the possibility of his getting married in a short time, in which event the contribution to the parent(s) and siblings is likely to be cut drastically.	None
Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependant and the mother alone will be considered as a dependant.	None
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as dependants, because they will either be independent and earning, or married, or be dependent on the father.	None
Thus even if the deceased is survived by parents and siblings, only the mother would be considered to be a dependant, and 50 would be treated as the personal and living expenses of the bachelor and 50 as the contribution to the family.	None
However, where the family of the bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, as in a case where he has a widowed mother and large number of younger nonearning sisters or brothers, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to onethird and contribution to the family will be taken as twothird.	None
Re Question  Selection of multiplier We therefore hold that the multiplier to be used should be as mentioned in Column (4) of the table above (prepared by applying Susamma Thomas, Trilok Chandra and Charlie), which starts with an operative multiplier of 18 (for the age groups of 15 to 20 and 21 to 25 years), reduced by one unit for every five years, that is M 17 for 26 to 30 years, M16 for 31 to 35 years, M15 for 36 to 40 years, M14 for 41 to 45 years, and M13 for 46 to 50 years, then reduced by two units for every five years, that is, M11 for 51 to 55 years, M9 for 56 to 60 years, M7 for 61 to 65 years and M5 for 66 to 70 years.	None
Admittedly both the parents, Ist appellant Amrit Bhanu Shali (father) and 2nd appellant Smt.	None
Sarlaben (mother) have been held to be dependents of deceased Ritesh Bhanu Shali and, therefore, the Tribunal held that the Ist appellant and 2nd appellant have the right to get the compensation.	None
On the date of the accident the 3rd appellant Mamta was not married but by the time the case was heard by the Tribunal the 3rd appellantMamta had already been married.	None
In these circumstances, she is not found to be dependent upon the deceased.	None
Thus, both the parents being dependents, i.e., father and the mother, the Tribunal rightly restricted the personal and living expenses of the deceased to 50 and contribution to the family was required to be taken as 50 as per the decision of this Court in the case of Sarla Verma (supra).	None
The selection of multiplier is based on the age of the deceased and not on the basis of the age of dependent.	Reasoning
There may be a number of dependents of the deceased whose age may be different and, therefore, the age of dependents has no nexus with the computation of compensation.	Reasoning
In the case of Sarla Verma (supra) this Court held that the multiplier to be used should be as mentioned in Column (4) of the table of the said judgment which starts with an operative multiplier of 18.	None
As the age of the deceased at the time of the death was 26 years, the multiplier of 17 ought to have been applied.	None
The Tribunal taking into consideration the age of the deceased rightly applied the multiplier of 17 but the High Court committed a serious error by not giving the benefit of multiplier of 17 and brining it down to the multiplier of 13.	None
The appellants produced Income Tax Returns of deceasedRitesh Bhanu Shali for the years 2002 to 2008 which have been marked as Ext.P10C. The Income Tax Return for the year 20072008 filed on 12.03.2008 at Raipur, four months prior to the accident, shows the income of Rs.99,000/ per annum.	Reasoning
The Tribunal has rightly taken into consideration the aforesaid income of Rs.99,000/ for computing the compensation.	Reasoning
If the 50 of the income of Rs.99,000/ is deducted towards personal and living expenses of the deceased the contribution to the family will be 50, i.e., Rs.49,500/ per annum.	Reasoning
At the time of the accident, the deceasedRitesh Bhanu Shali was 26 years old, hence on the basis of decision in Sarla Verma (supra) applying the multiplier of 17, the amount will come to Rs.49,500/ x 17	Reasoning
Rs.8,41,500/. Besides this amount the claimants are entitled to get Rs.50,000/ each towards the affection of the son, i.e., Rs.1,00,000/ and Rs.10,000/ on account of funeral and ritual expenses and Rs.2,500/ on account of loss of sight as awarded by the Tribunal.	Reasoning
Therefore, the total amount comes to Rs.9,54,000/ (Rs.8,41,500/ Rs.1,00,000/ Rs.10,000/ Rs.2,500/) and the claimants are entitled to get the said amount of compensation instead of the amount awarded by the Tribunal and the High Court.	Reasoning
They would also be entitled to get interest at the rate of 6 per annum from the date of the filing of the claim petition leaving rest of the conditions mentioned in the award intact.	Reasoning
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.	Decision
The impugned judgment dated 12.11.2010 passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in Misc.	Decision
Appeal No.(C)	Decision
No.515 of 2010 is set aside and the award passed by the Tribunal is modified to the extent above.	Decision
The amount which has already been received by the claimantsappellants shall be adjusted and rest of the amount be paid at an early date.	Decision
No order as to costs.	Decision
