Facts
Counter affidavit has been filed by respondent No.1 Mazdoor Union and the respondent No.2employer.	None
Mr. Anil Divan, learned senior counsel invited our attention to the various orders passed by the High Court in the writ petition on 19.05.1986, 17.07.1987, 09.03.1988 and the final order passed by the High Court in the impugned judgment.	Facts
Our attention was also drawn to the petition to vacate the exparte order dated 19.05.1986 passed by the High Court with a prayer to suitably modify to safeguard the interest of the management with regard to the anomalies mentioned in the counter affidavit.	Facts
It is stated in the counter affidavit that the workmen got the facilities contemplated under the ESI Act and that the workmen did not get the medical allowance but the management pays more in the form of its ESI contribution than what it would pay in the form of medical allowance to the workmen.	Facts
It is also stated that the distance of the dispensary from the factory is nearly 8 kms.	Facts
which is highly inconvenient for the workmen to really avail of the facility intended to be provided to them.	Facts
In view of the exparte order, the ESI deductions of the members of the Union have been stopped and in compliance with the Courts Order the management was not deducting the ESI contributions of its workmen.	Facts
However, the aforesaid order, according to the learned senior counsel for the management, though has been complied with is creating, inter alia, many anomalies.	Facts
The Court has not made it clear as to what shall be the effect of the stoppage of the deductions on the statutory liability of the answering respondent contemplated under sections 40 and 41 of the ESI Act.	Facts
It has also not been made clear as to what shall be the consequences if a workman dies or sustains injury during the substance of the interim order as it is very likely that the Corporation in such an event may take a stand of not compensating the workmen for the injury sustained as their contribution is not being paid to the Corporation.	None
That the answering respondent is nevertheless depositing 5 per cent contribution without any benefit to its workmen and it is just and proper that so long as the deductions are not being made the answering respondent should also not be obliged to pay its E.S.I contribution with regard to its workmen.	None
With the above averments, the management employer filed the petition to vacate the exparte order granted by the High Court on 19.05.1986 or to suitably modify the same to safeguard the interest of the management in regard to the anomalies mentioned in the paragraphs (supra).	Facts
However, the High Court, by its order dated 17.07.1987 instead of vacating the interim stay confirmed the same with certain modifications that no deduction shall be made either from the employer or from the employees towards the contribution under the ESI Act.	Facts
The said order was again modified on 09.03.1988 to the effect that the words payments and allowances occurring in order dated 17.07.1987 shall be substituted by the words provide and facility.	Facts
That the appellant has not referred to or mentioned about the two important orders that has been passed by the High Court.	None
The said order would show that The employer company have initially opposed the writ petition filed by the Employees Union and had also prayed for vacation of the exparte interim order dated 19.05.1986 passed by the High Court and or prayed for suitable modification of the order to safeguard the interest of the respondent company (employer), in view of the provisions of the Act.	Facts
However, the High Court after hearing the parties, confirmed the interim order dated 19.05.1986 and directed that no deduction shall be made either from the employer or the employees towards the contribution under ESI Act provided the respondent employer shall pay medical allowance to its workmen.	Facts
Respondent No.2 again applied for modification instead of medical allowance, Respondent No.2 was providing willing to provide medical facilities.	Facts
The High Court thereafter by order dated 09.03.1988 substituted the words payment and allowances with provide and facilities.	Facts
Therefore with the modification of the initial ex parte order dated 19.05.1986 by subsequent orders dated 17.07.1987 and 09.03.1988, the respondent No.2 was restrained from making contribution to ESIC and was directed to provide medical facilities to the employees.	Facts
ESIC was not providing medical facilities to the employees in as much as the employees themselves contented in the writ petition that the hospital of ESIC was more than 12 kms away from the factory and even ordinary medical facilities are not available to them and it was therefore, impossible for them to avail of the facilities.	Facts
It is submitted by learned senior counsel that under compulsion of the above order, the employer company did, in fact, provided medical facilities to the employees as per directions of the High Court and that the employees were also fully satisfied with the medical facilities provided by the employer and have never raised any grievance till date.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also submitted that the respondentcompany has spent large amount of money in view of the order of the High Court for providing medical facilities and subsequently also paid medical allowances to the employees.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is stated that if the High Court had not passed the order of injunction, the respondentcompany would have contributed to the ESIC instead of spending monies on the medical facilities and allowances.	Arguments of Petitioner
In these circumstances, Mr. Anil Divan submitted that it would be unfair and unjust to make the employer to pay contribution towards ESIC since in lieu of the contribution to ESIC, the employer provided medical facilities as per the directions of the High Court and it would cause extreme and grave hardship to the employer if it is required to pay contribution for the past for no fault of its own.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also submitted that no party should suffer because of the orders of the Court if duly complied with.	Arguments of Respondent
We see much force, substance and merit in the above submission of the learned senior counsel.	None
It is further pertinent to see that the first interim order was passed by the High Court on 19.05.1986 and it was modified on the application of the respondent No.2 on 17.07.1987 and 09.03.1988.	None
The interim orders were not challenged at all by the ESIC and were thus accepted.	None
Despite the pendency of the matter for 17 years, the ESIC did not file any reply or counter affidavit in the writ petition nor filed any application for variation vacation of the stay as stated in the special leave petition and in fact accepted the interim order.	None
It was, thus, not disputed by the ESIC that the employees were not getting any medical facilities from ESIC and they were in fact getting medical facilities from the employer.	None
The High Court observed as follows However, since there was an interim order of this court dated 19.05.1986 as modified on 17.07.1987, which directed that no deduction shall be made from the employer or employees towards contribution for E.S.I, and in fact E.S.I facility was not availed by the employees of respondent No. 3 hence in our opinion it would be unfair if the respondent No.3 and its employees are directed to pay contribution for the period when they never got this facility.	None
Learned Counsel for respondent No.3 has stated that the respondent No.3 was giving medical relief to its employees on its own and no medical benefit was given by the E.S.I Corporation.	None
Under these circumstances, we direct that no contribution shall be realized from the employer or employees till today towards E.S.I contribution, but from today onwards they will start paying E.S.I Contribution and employees may avail benefit of the E.S.I Scheme.	Facts
With the above observation, this petition is disposed off finally.	None
In our opinion, the High Court was fully justified in passing the judicious order after considering the equities by directing the employer and the employees to make ESIC contribution for the future i.e. from the date of disposal of the writ petition and should not bear with the liability for the past inasmuch as the employees of the respondent No.2 has not availed any medical facilities from ESIC and at the same time the employer was providing the medical facilities due to interim order of the High Court.	Reasoning
In these circumstances, the order passed by the High Court, in our considered opinion, meets the ends of justice and does not require interference by this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.	None
This apart it is important to note that in the past 17 years when the interim orders passed by the High Court was enforced, several employees have left retired and were paid the entire salary without any deduction and, therefore, it will be impossible for the employer to recover the part of the employees contribution in respect of the ESIC from the employees.	Reasoning
A separate counter affidavit was filed by the Mazdoor Union in support of the employer.	Reasoning
As regards the question of law raised by learned counsel for the ESIC regarding the view taken by the High Court, we are of the opinion that the view taken by the High Court was on account of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.	Reasoning
As already noticed, the deduction of contribution of the members of the Union had been specifically stayed by the High Court and the same continued for a period of 18 years till the disposal of the petition and that none of the members of the Union had availed facilities of the ESI.	Reasoning
In our view, passing of the final order by the High Court directing the payment of ESI contribution from the date of the said judgment does not amount to postponing the enforcement of notification and the same is also not in violation of the principles laid down by this Court in the various judgments referred to above.	None
There has been no postponement of the enforcement of the notification in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, namely, the nonavailability of the facilities, nondeduction of contribution from the members of the Union for 18 long years, provision of medical relief by the Management.	Reasoning
The High Court had directed deduction of contribution with effect from the date of the judgment, which, in our opinion, is perfectly justified.	Reasoning
This apart, the members of the Union included casual, temporary, contractual, badli workmen and it will be practically impossible to find each and every member of the Union to recover their contribution for the last 18 years and in fact some of the workmen who would have been the employees during all these years would have left, expired etc.	Reasoning
and on account thereof also their contribution cannot be recovered.	Reasoning
The judgments relied on by counsel for the appellant are distinguishable on facts and on law.	Reasoning
The order passed by the High Court, in our opinion, is perfectly justified in view of the facts and circumstances of the case and it has been repeatedly held by this Court that such a relief can be granted in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and that there can be an exception as in the present case and, therefore, it cannot be said that the directions issued by the High Court are not correct or that they are contrary to the power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.	Reasoning
The High Court, in our opinion, while disposing off the writ petition filed by the Union has taken a just, pragmatic, fair and judicious view after considering all the equities and facts and circumstances of the case.	None
Extreme hardship might have been caused to both the employer as well as the employee since no medical facilities have been availed by the workmen from ESIC and the employer had provided medical facilities to the workmen as per the Court orders and also had paid medical allowances.	Decision
In the result, all the three appeals are dismissed and the judgments passed by the High Court are affirmed.	Decision
However, there will be no order as to costs.	None
The question of law is left open to be decided in an appropriate case.	None
