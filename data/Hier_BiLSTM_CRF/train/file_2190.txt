Assuming such transfer was bad in law, the voting rights in relation thereto continued to remain vested with the transferors.	Facts
In a petition under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act, the Court is concerned with the question as to whether the control of the company slipped from one party to the other and as the Appellants, in any event, continued to form majority and, thus, any transfer made in favour of Indreni did not amount to oppression.

As far as 3000 shares are concerned, the Division Bench did not accept the authenticity of the letter by the Company Secretary of FRG renouncing the shares.	Facts
Transfer of 9415 shares to Indreni was held to be invalid as no transfer notice was given to the company as required in terms of Article 8 of the Articles of Association.	Facts
As the transfer was duly recorded, to undo any such transfer, a resolution by the Board of Directors of Indreni would be required.	Facts
In the absence of any such resolution the transfer being complete, only Indreni could have transferred the shares back to the Appellants.	Facts
The Division Bench further held that there was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Appellant No.1.	None
It opined that the relief that may b granted by the Courts is equitable though originating from a statutory provision.	None

In assailing the judgment of the Division Bench, the learned counsel at the outset would draw our attention to the fact that the concerned companies were family companies, having been floated by FRG and the affairs of several of them were being managed by his brothers and sisters.	Arguments of Petitioner
Appellant No. 1 had been put incharge of the BRC and GIC for a long time.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that no dispute was ever raised as regard the decision of the Board of Directors to broadbase the company by floating 25000 shares out of which 15000 shares were to be allotted at the first instance.	Arguments of Petitioner
The pattern of share allotment pursuant to or in furtherance of the decision of the Board of Directors i.e. 8000 shares were allotted to FRG and 6475 shares were allotted to the Appellants stood admitted.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that the Division Bench of the High Court committed a manifest error insofar as it failed to take into consideration the admission of Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.12 herein that 6475 shares were allotted pursuant to the Resolution of the Board during the life time of FRG.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such allotment was in fact admitted in the company petition filed by the Respondent No.1.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel would contend that only at a later stage when the Respondent No.12 herein filed a company petition before the Company Law Board, Delhi a challenge as regards allotment of 6475 shares was also made.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the Company Petition although the reliefs were later on amended, pleadings were not.	Arguments of Petitioner
On a fair and reasonable reading of the pleadings, it was submitted that only inference that can be drawn was that the subject matter of challenge centered round the allotment of 3000 shares only and transfer of their shares by the Appellants to Indreni on the premise that it being an outsider it was impermissible in terms of the relevant provisions of the Articles of Association.	Arguments of Petitioner
35.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Salve would argue that as the Appellants had acquired 6475 additional shares, there was indisputably no question of their abusing any position to take over the company as they had all along been incharge thereof.	Arguments of Petitioner
36.	Arguments of Petitioner
Respondent Nos.1 and 12, Mr. Salve would contend, having taken inspection of the documents on 10.12.1990 and company petition having been filed on 4.3.1991 as well as the relevant documents having been annexed thereto would clearly demonstrate that reliance thereupon had been placed by the Respondent No.1 herein and, thus, on the admitted fact, the Division Bench committed a manifest error in issuing the impugned directions insofar as it failed to take into consideration that the company was a family concern in respect whereof a completely different standard should be applied.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this case, it has not been found that the Respondents had been thrown out of the Management or they were deprived of the shares of BRC.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that the company was not in active business and had held only some shares in Alaukik and BRC.	Arguments of Petitioner
Furthermore, there was no lack of probity or acts of misfeasance of company property on the part of the Appellants.	Arguments of Petitioner
The composition of the parties would not change even if allotment of 3000 shares as also the transfer of Indreni are held to be invalid inasmuch as by reason of the shareholding pattern the Appellants would continue to be in the majority.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel would contend that the dispute arose only after Mrs. Puar transferred 1500 shares of Alaukik to herself and by reason thereof the mother and daughter intended to take over Alaukik and consequently BRC.	Arguments of Petitioner
Only as a face saving measure, Respondent No.1 claimed 8000 shares which were allotted to FRG on 29.11.1990 and not prior thereto.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that Respondent No.1 applied for succession certificates on 28.11.1989 wherein she disclosed the assets of FRG but except 22 shares in GIC she did not lay claim on any other share of GIC, far less 8000 shares.	Arguments of Petitioner
Before filing their respective company petitions both Respondent Nos.1 and 12 were aware about the entire state of affairs and their purported ignorance about the internal affairs of the company is not borne out of records.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, our attention has been drawn to paragraphs 7 and 8 of the statements made in the company petition by the Respondent No.1.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that identical statements were made by the Respondent no.12 in her Company Petition before the Company Law Board, Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
37.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even therein no allegation as regard fabrication of document or any aggrandizement on the par to of the Appellant was raised.	Arguments of Petitioner
Respondent Nos.1 and 12, it was urged, prevaricated their stand from time to time and as such their plea should not have been accepted by the Division Bench.	Arguments of Petitioner
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS Mr. Ashok Desai and Mr. P.V. Kapoor, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 respectively, on the other hand, would submit Appellant No.1 being in fiduciary position as the Director of GIC as also a family member was required to act in utmost good faith, make full and honest disclosure to other shareholders and thus he could not have made any profit by allotting shares to himself and his family members directly or indirectly and was furthermore required to inform the shareholders as regard the benefits arising therefrom so that they could participate therein.	Arguments of Respondent
Such a fiduciary position remains, despite nonapplicability of Section 81 of the Company Act.	None
Appellant No.1 in breach of said fiduciary duty aggrandized himself by transforming himself from a miniscule minority of 1.86 to 86 and failed to explain as to how he got such advantages to the detriment of other shareholders.	Arguments of Respondent
The explanations offered by him as regard allotment of shares are wholly inconsistent and contradictory as conflicting versions had been set out which do not clearly and cogently explain as to how the different shares were (a) decided to be issued, (b) offered for subscription, (c) allotted to Appellant No.1 and (d) allotted to nonmembers.	Arguments of Respondent
Transfer to Indreni was a device to put the shares beyond the reach of the original shareholders and the said company actually received the benefits thereof by getting dividends.	Arguments of Respondent
It is true that Respondents came out with a different case but that was because of the fact that they had no knowledge about the complete affairs of the company to start with having regard to the fact that the Appellants were in control of the relevant documents.	Arguments of Respondent
The total constellation of the circumstances would show that the Appellant No.1 had aggrandized himself and his conduct had led to oppression of other members.	Arguments of Respondent
The power of the company court under Sections 397 and 398 being of widest amplitude the reliefs granted by the Division Bench were permissible in law.	None
Each share of GIC way a valuable one keeping in view of the share price of BRC, Alaukik and other properties possessed by it.	None
The value of each share of GIC which was floated at the rate of Rs. 100 would have been worth more than Rs.900 and furthermore by investing nine lakhs, the Appellants received more than 30 lakhs of rupees by way of dividend.	Arguments of Respondent
As BRC had declared dividend and was a profit making company, there was no need to broadbase company.	None
The burden to prove bonafide was on the Appellants.	Arguments of Respondent
REPLY Mr. Salve in reply would inter alia contend that the question of aggrandizement had neither been pleaded nor proved.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel furthermore urge that there was no factual foundation as regard the allegation of fraud or selfaggrandizement.	Arguments of Petitioner
He would contend that a distinction has to be borne in mind as regard fiduciary relationship with the company and with the shareholder.	Arguments of Petitioner
POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION Whether the Appellant No.1 in his capacity as Director of the Company had a fiduciary duty towards the shareholders.	Issue
Whether there has been a valid decision to broadbase the company by issuing additional shares.	None
Whether the allotment of 6475 shares and 3000 shares in favour of the Appellants herein was valid in law.	None
Whether the Respondent No.1 herein could claim title in respect of 8000 shares in the petition filed under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act.	Issue
Whether transfer of 9415 shares in favour of Indreni by the Appellants was valid and if not the effect thereof.	Issue
Whether the issue of oppression and or mismanagement on the part of the Appellant No.1 herein in running the affairs of the Company towards the Respondent Nos.1 and 12 have been proved.	None
FIDUCIARY DUTY Chapter IX of the Indian Trusts Act provides for certain obligations in the nature of trusts.	None
The Trust Act recognizes various kinds of trusts including resulting trust.	None
An express trust, however, may be created by reason of an agreement between the parties.	None
See Barclays Bank vs. Quistclose Investments 1970 AC 567	None
By reason of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act, a person bound in fiduciary character is required to protect the interests of other persons but the heart and soul thereof is that as between two persons one is bound to protect the interest of the other and if the former availing of that relationship makes a pecuniary gain for himself Section 88 would be attracted.	Reasoning
What is sought to be prevented by a person holding such fiduciary benefit is unjust enrichment or unjust benefit derived from another which is against conscience that he should keep.	Reasoning
When a person makes a pecuniary gain by reason of a transaction, the cestui qui trust created thereunder must be restored back.	Reasoning
The purported breach of trust on the part of Appellant No.1 herein relate to Issuance of additional 15000 shares Allotment of 6475 shares to himself and his family members as also an HUF and Allotment of 3000 shares out of 8000 shares which had been allotted to FRG in favour of his minor children.	None
Transfer of 9415 shares in favour of Indreni.	None
Issuance of equity based capital shares under the Companies Act in relation to a private company would be governed by its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association.	None
It has not been pointed out that in terms of Memorandum of Association the Board of Directors acted ultra vires in adopting a resolution as regard issuance of 25000 capital shares out of which 15000 shares were to be issued at the first instance.	None
Section 81 of the Companies Act indisputably has no application in relation to a private company, the prerequisite thereof is, thus, not attracted in the instant case.	None
Appellant No.1, therefore, apart from Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act in the event of its applicability did not have any statutory obligation to discharge as a trustee in this behalf.	None
A Director of a Company indisputably stands in a fiduciary capacity visavis the Company.	None
He must act for the paramount interest of the company.	None
He does not have any statutory duty to perform so far as individual shareholders are concerned subject of course to any special arrangement which may be entered into or a special circumstance that may arise in a particular case.	None
Each case, thus, is required to be considered having regard to the fact situation obtaining therein and having regard to the existence of any special arrangement or special circumstance.	None
The question came up for consideration as far back in 1901 in Percival vs. Wright 1902 (2) Ch. 421.	None
In that case, the shares of the company were in few hands which were transferable only with the approval of the Board of Directors.	None
The shares did not carry any market price and were not to be quoted at the stock exchange.	None
The plaintiffs therein intended to dispose of certain shares wherefor they offered 12/5s.	None
per share purported to be based on a valuation which they had obtained from independent valuers a few months prior thereto.	None
The said offer was accepted.	None
The transaction pertaining to the said agreement was entered into but it was later on discovered by the plaintiffs that prior to and during their own negotiations for sale the Chairman and the Board were approached by one Holden with a view to the purchase the entire undertaking of the company with a view to resell the same at a profit to a new company.	None
The question of fiduciary obligation on the part of the Directors arose therein when the plaintiff brought an action against the Chairman and the two other purchasing Directors asking for setting aside the sale on the ground that the defendants as Directors ought to have disclosed the feature of negotiations with Holden when negotiating purchase of their shares.	None
The question therein posed was Assuming that directors are, in a sense, trustees for the company, are they trustees for individual shareholders?	None
The Chancery Division dispute holding that the Directors must be bonafide and for the best interest of the company did not accept the argument that the relationship between the shareholders inter se are the same as that of partners in an unincorporated company holding The contrary view would place directors in a most invidious position, as they could not buy or sell shares without disclosing negotiations, a premature disclosure of which might well be against the best interests of the company.	None
I am of the opinion that directors are not in that position.	None
There is no question of unfair dealing in this case.	None
The directors did not approach the shareholders with the view of obtaining their shares.	None
The shareholders approached the directors, and named the price at which they were desirous of selling.	None
46.h of this Court in Nanalal Zaver and Another vs. Bombay Life Assurance Co.Ltd. and Others 1950 SCR 391 in the following terms It is clear that until the Singhania group get their names entered in the register of the members they are not shareholders but are complete strangers to the company.	None
It has been held in Percival vs. Wright L.R. (1902) 2	None
Ch. 421 that ordinarily the directors are not trustees for the individual shareholders.	None
Even if the directors owe some duty to the existing shareholders on the footing of there being some fiduciary relationship between them as stated in some cases see for example.	None
In re Gresham Life Assurance Society L.R. 8 Ch. App. 446 at p.449 I see no cogent reason for extending this principle and imputing any kind of fiduciary relationship between the directors and persons who are complete strangers to the company.	None
In my judgment, therefore, the conduct of the respondents 2 to 9 cannot be judged on the basis of any assumed fiduciary relationship existing between them and the Singhamia group.	None
In my opinion, the respondents 2 to 9 owed no duty to the Singhania group and, therefore, the motive to exclude them cannot be said to be mala fide per se.	None
The Court further held that having regard to Regulation 42 read with Section 105C of 1936 Companies Act visavis Regulation 27 of 1882 Act, the directors exercise a larger power to issue additional capital shares.	None
It is true that while referring to Percival, the court used the expression ordinarily, but if a special situation arises, it would be for the person complaining to plead and demonstrate the same.	None
We, however, do not intend to put our seal of approval on Percival (supra) in its entirety.	None
The situation may be different when a special contract, special relationship or special circumstances arise.	None
Percival (supra) may not also be applicable in a case of take over bid (Gelting vs. Kilner 1972 (1) All ER 1166) or when the general body of shareholders is only two of them (Glavanies vs. Brurning hausen (1996) 19 ACSR 204)	None
In Palmers Company Law, 23rd edition, page 848, it is stated 6402.	None
Relationship is with company.	None
the fiduciary relationship of a director exists with the company the director is not usually a trustee for individual shareholders.	None
Thus, a director may accept a shareholders offer to sell shares in the company although he may have information which is not available to that other, and the contract cannot be upset even if the director knew of some fact which made the offer an attractive proposition.	None
So in Percival vs. Wright a person who had approached a director and sold him shares in the company, afterwards, upon discovering that the director had known at the time of the contract that negotiations were on foot for the purchase by an outsider of all the shares in the company at a higher figure, could not impeach the contract.	None
In his judgment SwinfenEady J. said there is no question of unfair dealing in this case.	None
The directors did not approach the shareholders with the view of obtaining their shares.	None
The shareholders approached the directors and named the price at which they were desirous of selling.	None
In Penningtons Company Law 6th Edn.	Reasoning
at page 60809, it is stated Directors we no fiduciary or other duties to individual members of their company in directing and managing the companys affairs, acquiring or disposing of assets on the companys behalf, entering into transactions on its behalf, or in recommending the adoption by members of proposals made to them collectively.	None
If directors mismanage that companys affairs, they incur liability to pay damages or compensation to the company or to make restitution of it, but individual members cannot recover compensation for the loss they have respectively suffered by the consequential fall in value of their shares, and they cannot achieve this indirectly by suing the directors for conspiracy to breach the duties which they owed the company.	None
However, there may be certain situations where directors do owe a fiduciary duty and a duty to exercise reasonable skill and care in advising members in connection with a transaction or situation which involves the company or its business undertaking and also the individual holdings of its members.	None
In Dawson International plc vs. Coats Patons plc 1988 SLT 854 Percival (supra) was relied upon holding that the Directors are, in general, under no fiduciary duty to shareholders and in particular current shareholders with respect to the disposal of their shares in the most advantageous way as directors are not their agents and as such are not normally entrusted with the management of their shares.	None
It was, however, observed that if the directors take it upon themselves to give advice to current shareholders they have a duty to act in good faith and not fraudulently nor can mislead the shareholders whether deliberately or carelessly, in which event, they may have remedy.	None
A distinction, thus, has been carved out as regards the fiduciary duty of the directors with regard to the property and funds of the company as contradistinguished from the duty of directors to current shareholders as sellers of their shares.	Reasoning
In case of conflict between two interests, the companys interest must be protected.	Reasoning
The directors, however, will have a fiduciary relation if they have taken unto themselves the burden of giving advice to current shareholders.	Reasoning
The aforementioned principles of law found favour with the Court in Needle Industries (India) Ltd. and Others vs. Needle Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd and Others (1981) 3 SCC 333 wherein it was held Where directors of a company seek, by entering into an agreement to issue new shares, to prevent a majority shareholder from exercising control of the company, they will not be held to have failed in fiduciary duty to the company if they act in good faith in what they believe, on reasonable grounds, to be the interests of the company.	None
If the directors primary purpose is to act in the interests of the company, they are acting in good faith even though they also benefit as a result.	None
In Needle (supra), this Court furthermore noticed Punt vs. Symons (1903) 2 CH 506 and opined in the following terms In Punt vs. Symons (1903) 2 Ch 506 72 LJ Ch 768 89 LT 525 52 WR 41), which applied the principle of Fraser vs. Whalley (71 ER 361 11 LT 175), it was held that Where shares had been issued by the Directors not for the general benefit of the company, but for the purpose of controlling the holders of the greater number of shares by obtaining a majority of voting power, they ought to be restrained from holding the meeting at which the votes of the new shareholders were to have been used.	None
But Byrne, J stated There may be occasions when Directors may fairly and properly issue shares in the case of a company constituted like the present for other reasons.	None
For instance it would not be at all an unreasonable thing to create a sufficient number of shareholders to enable statutory powers to be exercised.	None
Peterson J. applied the principle enunciated in Fraser (71 ER 361 11 LT 175) and in Punt (((1903)	None
Ch 506 72 LJ Ch 768 89 LT 525 52 WR 41) in the case of Piercy vs. S. Mills Company Ltd. ((1920)	None
1 Chancery 77 (191819)	None
All ER Rep 313 (Ch D) 122 LT 20 35 TLR 703).	None
The learned Judge observed at page 84 The basis of both cases is, as I understand, that Directors are not entitled to use their powers of issuing shares merely for the purpose of maintaining their control or the control of themselves and their friends over the affairs of the company, or merely for the purpose of defeating the wishes of the existing majority of shareholders merely for an extraneous purpose like maintenance or acquisition of control over the affairs of the Company In Needle Industries (supra), Nanalal Zaver (supra) was affirmed stating the sole test is whether the issue of shares is simply or solely for the benefit of the Directors holding If the shares are issued in the larger interest of the company, the decision to issue shares cannot be struck down on the ground that it has incidentally benefited the Directors in their capacity as shareholders.	None
Fiduciary duty of the Directors to the company should not be equated with the duty to the shareholders.	None
In Peskin and Another vs. Anderson and Others 2001 1 BCLC 372, Percival (supra) as also other decisions taking similar or contrary view were noticed by the Court of Appeal including the judgment of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in Coleman vs, Myrs as also Court of Appeal of New South Wales in Brunninghausen vs. Glavnics (1999) 46 NSWLR and held that the directors had no fiduciary duty to the shareholders in the facts and circumstances obtaining therein.	None
However, observations were made therein that such duties may arise in special circumstances demonstrating the salient features and wellestablished categories of fiduciary relationship such as agency which involves duties of trusts, confidence and loyalty.	None
Absence of special circumstances or special reasons as pointed out hereinbefore normally would not bring in the concept of fiduciary relationship in a director visavis the current shareholders.	None
However, in Coleman (supra) and Brunninghausen (supra) it was held that the fiduciary duties of directors to the shareholders exist in the specially strong context of the familial relationship having regard to their personal position of influence in the company concerned.	None
We may at this stage consider the case laws replied upon by Mr. Desai.	None
M s. Dale Carrington Invt.	None
P.Ltd.	None
Anr.	None
vs. P.K. Prathapan Ors. 2004 (7) SCALE 586 requires a closer scrutiny.	None
In that case one P.K. Prathapan (Prathapan), and NRI through his mother induced Ramanujam to promote a company by making initial investment of Rs.5 lakhs is shares.	None
Prathapan, the principal shareholder of the Company came to know that the Board of Directors in its meeting held on 24th October, 1994 and chaired by Ramanujam, adopted a resolution on the premise that a sum of Rs. 6,86,500/ stood to the credit of said Ramanujam and in lieu thereof equity shares of Rs.100/ each would be allotted in his favour.	None
Prathapan was not intimated about the said meeting.	None
By reason of the said act, Prathapan who was a majority shareholder in the Company was reduced to a minority.	None
The case of Prathapan was that Ramanujam did not contribute any money from his own resources for the purpose of starting the company and he all along drew a handsome salary for working as Managing Director thereof.	None
The charge of oppression and mismanagement against Ramanujam by Prathapan before the Company Law Board succeeded.	None
However, the only relief which Prathapan obtained was a direction upon him to sell his shares to Ramanujam which was questioned by him.	None
This Court held that the directors act on behalf of a company in a fiduciary capacity and their acts and duties are to be exercised for the benefit of the company.	None
It, however, while analyzing the acts of a director as an agent of the company observed that in limited sense they are also trustees for the shareholders of the company.	None
However, without discussing the limitations of such fiduciary relationship, it was observed 15The fiduciary capacity within which the Directors have to act enjoins upon them a duty to act on behalf of a company with utmost good faith, utmost care and skill and due diligence and in the interest of the company they represent.	None
They have a duty to make full and honest disclosure to the shareholders regarding all important matters relating to the company.	None
It follows that in the matter of issue of additional shares, the directors owe a fiduciary duty to issue shares for a proper purpose.	None
This duty is owed by them to the share holders of the company.	None
Therefore, even though Section 81 of the Companies Act which contains certain requirements in the matter of issue of further share capital by a company does not apply to private limited companies, the directors in a private limited company are expected to make a disclosure to the shareholders of such a company when further shares are being issued.	None
This requirement flows from their duty to act in good faith and make full disclosure to the shareholders regarding affairs of a company.	None
The acts of directors in a private limited company are required to be tested on a much finer scale in order to rule out any misuse of power for personal gains or ulterior motives.	None
Evidently, therefore, the ratio which emerges from the decision is that the duty to disclose as regard issue of additional shares is relatable to proper purpose thereof.	None
If the purpose is proper and the action of the director is bonafide, the ratio should not be extended so as to hold that such a duty of the director towards the shareholders is absolute despite the fact that there is no legal requirement therefor.	None
Duty of disclosure to shareholders in that case and a strong nexus with the affairs of the company.	None
Date Carrington (supra0 in not an authority for the proposition that the purported fiduciary duty of a director towards the shareholder is absolute although the transaction in question may not have a direct corelationship with the affairs of the company.	None
Moreover, the Bench did not have the advantage of considering the 4Judge Bench decision of this Court in Nanalal Zaver (supra).	None
It furthermore did not have the advantage of noticing the decisions of other jurisdictions which had been noticed hereinbefore.	None
The Court, it is interesting to note, noticed Needle Industries (supra) as regards the power of the company to issue new shares but the legal effect thereof was not considered in details.	None
The directors have a power to issue additional capital shares and in the process may obtain some pecuniary gain but only when such pecuniary gain is obtained through ulterior motive they would be answerable to the shareholders.	None
It is also interesting to note that while applying the extraneous purpose test or ulterior motive test, the Court noticed Piercv vs. S. Mills Co. Ltd. (1920) 1	None
Ch. 77 wherein it was held The basis of both cases is, as I understand, that Directors are not entitled to use their powers of issuing shares merely for the purpose of maintaining their control or the control of themselves and their friends over the affairs of the company, or merely for the purpose of defeating the wishes of the existing majority of shareholders.	None
The expression merely assumes significance.	None
Significantly, in Needle Industries (supra) it was categorically held that the Directors have power to issue shares at par even if their market price is higher being primarily a matter of policy.	None
(See para 120) Proper purpose doctrine and the doctrine of fairness visavis the doctrine of bona fide as considered in view of its findings that the allotment of all additional shares was gained by Ramanujam through manipulations and commission of acts of frauds upon becoming the Managing Director of the Company with a view to gain sole control of the management thereof and to the exclusion of Prathapan.	None
The ratio in Dale and Carrington (supra), thus, must be understood to have been rendered in the fact situation obtaining in that case.	None
It does not lay down a law that fiduciary duty of a director to the company extends to a shareholder so as to entitle him to be informed of all important decisions taken by the Board of Directors.	None
Such a broad proposition of law, if understood to have been laid down in Dale and Carrington, would be inconsistent with the duty of a director visavis the Company and the settled law that the statutory duty of a direction is primarily to look after the interest of the company.	None
In Bajaj Auto Ltd. vs. N.K. Firodia and Another etc. (1970) 2 SCC 550 the Court was concerned with the discretionary exercise of power by the Directors in terms of Section 111(3) of the Companies Act.	None
In the light or refusal by director of register a transfer, the Court held that it is necessary for the directors to act bonafide and not arbitrarily in the following terms Article 52 of the appellant company provided that the Directors might at their absolute and uncontrolled discretion decline to register any transfer of shares.	None
Discretion does not mean a bare affirmation or negation of a proposal.	None
Discretion implies just and proper consideration of the proposal in the facts and circumstances of the case.	None
In the exercise of that discretion the Directors will Act for the paramount interest of the company and for the general interest of the shareholders because the Directors are in a fiduciary position both towards the company and towards every shareholders.	None
The Directors are therefore required to act bona fide and not arbitrarily and not for any collateral motive.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
This Court therein also applied the bona fide test of the Director and for the benefit of the company as a whole.	None
In that case, the directors assigned reason which were tested from three angles view, viz (i) whether the directors acted in the interested of the company (ii) whether they acted on a wrong principle and, (iii) whether they acted with an oblique motive or for a collateral purpose.	None
It was observed in M s. Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd vs. Shyam Sunder Jhunjhunwala Others (1962)	None
SCR 39 that the action of the directors must be set aside if the same was done oppressively, capriciously, corruptly or in some other way malafide.	None
In this case, this Courts is not faced with such a situation.	None
In Coleman and Others vs. Myres and Others (1977)2 NZLR 225 the gist of the complaint made by the appellants against the first respondent was that he planned to acquire total control of the company at virtually no cost to himself by means of selling the StrandCoburg and other properties of the company and making use of its liquid capital reserves that his inside knowledge of the companys affairs of the advice he obtained showed him that there were good prospects of accomplishing this, leaving him sole owner of an unencumbered asset worth some millions and that he not only refrained from disclosing to the shareholders generally his plan and the magnitude of his potential gain, but also made misrepresentations tending to conceal the plan.	None
In the aforementioned factual backdrop while holding that mere status of a company director would not create any responsibility towards a shareholder but it was observed that the standard of conduct required from a Director in relation to dealings with them will depend upon all the surrounding circumstances and the nature of responsibility which in a real and practical sense he has assumed.	None
In Penningtons Company Law, at page 609, on Coleman (supra), it is commented.	None
It is uncertain whether this reasoning can be extended to other situations where directors owe duties to the company but the relevant decision has to be made by its members individually or collectively and the directors advise them as to the decision they should make.	None
Such situations would include a proposed sale or disposal of the companys assets and undertaking, a proposed merger or division of the company, a proposed reorganization of the companys share capital affecting existing members and a proposal for the voluntary liquidation of the company.	None
Now law in absolute terms, thus, had been laid down therein.	None
In the instant case, there had been no transaction of sale and purchase of shares between the director and the shareholder.	None
The said decisions, therefore, have no application in the instant case.	None
In a way it instead of supporting the contention of Mr. Desai, counters his views.	None
It is interesting to note that in Needle Industries (supra) this Court said even in certain cases the Directors attempt to maintain their control over the company or in newly acquiring may not amount to abuse of their fiduciary power stating Applying this principle, it seems to us difficult to hold that by the issue of rights shares the Directors of NIIL interfered in any manner with the legal rights of the majority.	None
The majority had to disinvest or else to submit to the issue of rights shares in order to comply with the statutory requirements of FERA and the Reserve Banks directives.	None
Having chosen not to disinvest, an option which was open to them, they did not any longer possess the legal rights to insist that the Directors shall not issue the rights shares.	None
What the Directors did was clearly in the larger interests of the Company and in obedience to their duty to comply with the law of the land.	None
The fact that while discharging that duty they incidentally trenched upon the interests of the majority cannot invalidate their action.	None
The conversion of the existing majority into a minority was a consequence of what the Directors were obliged lawfully to do.	None
Such conversion were obliged lawfully to do.	None
Such conversion was not the motive force of their action.	None
No argument in this case was advanced as regard the purported breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Appellant No. 1 in the matter of increase of shares during the life time of FRG before the learned Single Judge on the other hand it was admitted the FRG during his life time was controlling the company, and thus, the Appellants herein in no way can be held, to have any fiduciary liability towards other shareholders in respect of issuance of 6475 shares in their favour.	None
Directors may have a fiduciary duty were a take over bid is made for a company and its directors advise its shareholders whether to accept or reject the bid as they owe a duty to advice honestly.	None
The standard of conduct expected of a director in relation to transaction with the shareholders will differ and would necessarily depend upon the circumstances and the nature of the responsibility.	None
It is, thus, not possible to lay down a law which will have universal application.	None
No authority has been brought to our notice which states that there exists and duty in a director to advise the shareholder as to whether they should purchase and share of the company or avail the benefit of an offer.	None
In an appropriate case, a fiduciary relationship may come into being having regard to the responsibility undertaken by the directors towards the shareholders by way of a special contract.	None
The law which emerges from the discussions made hereinbefore is that the directors do not have any fiduciary duty to advice shareholders as to when and in what manner they should enter with the transactions with the company including acceptance of offer of additional shares.	Reasoning
Such a fiduciary duty would arise inter alia in exceptional situations when the directors take upon themselves the task of advising the shareholders who may be his family members or when a transaction of purchase or sale is entered into by and between the director and the shareholders wherein the former taking undue benefit or having ill or improper or ulterior motive or malafide act solely to make pecuniary benefit and gain for himself and to the detriment of such shareholders.	Reasoning
If a general fiduciary duty of a director visavis shareholders is laid down the same would lead the directors to the risk of multiple legal actions by dissenting minority shareholders.	Reasoning
Burden of Proof According to Mr. Desai, however, the burden to prove his bona fide was upon the Respondent No.1.	None
The learned counsel in support of the said contention has referred to Section 111 of the Evidence Act and also relied upon a decision of this Court in Krishna Mohan Kul Alias Nani Charan Kul and another vs. Pratima Maity and others (2004) 9 SCC 468 ).	None
In Krishna Mohan (supra), this Court was considering a transaction resulting in execution of a deed of settlement by one Dasu Charan Kul.	None
The said deed was executed in presence of the witnesses although they were not in existence.	None
The executant in that case was more than 100 years of age.	None
He was paralytic and his mental and physical conditions were found to be not in order.	None
Though his leftthumb impression was stated to have been affixed on the document, there was no witness who could substantiate that he had in fact put his thumb impression.	None
In the aforementioned fact situation, provisions of Section 111 of the Indian Evidence Act was invoked holding that the burden of establishing perfect fairness, adequacy and equity is cast upon the person in whom the confidence has been reposed and the rule applies to all persons standing in confidential relations such as agents, trustees, executors, administrators, auctioneers, etc.	None
It was, however, clarified that in term of Section 111 of the Evidence Act, the person concerned should have been in a position of active confidence where fraud is alleged.	None
In this case no transaction took place between the parties, and thus, the ratio of Krishna Mohan (supra) is not applicable to the fact of the present case.	Reasoning
In view of our findings that having regard to the nature of transactions as the Appellant No.1 did not have any fiduciary duty towards the contesting Respondents, the question of invoking the provisions of Section 111 of the Evidence Act does not arise in the instant case.	Reasoning
In Regal (Hastings) Ltd. vs. Gulliver and others (1967) 2 AC 134), an action was brought by the Appellants therein against the Respondents who were defendants to recover the amount specified therein towards profits made by them upon the acquisition and sale by them of shares in the subsidiary company formed by the Appellant.	None
The said action was also brought against the companys solicitor for recovery of the amount specified therein being profits made by him in similar dealings in the shares.	None
The action was based on claim for damages and misfeasance and for negligence on their part.	None
It is in that situation, the doctrine of trust was applied.	None
In the fact of the present matter neither a case of trust nor negligence nor misfeasance has been made out.	None
The ratio which can be carved out from this case is that the Directors must not derive personal profit from information acquired by them as Directors.	None
Such is not the case here.	None
In Needle Industries (supra), this Court, observed that Section 397 warrants the court in looking at the business realities of the situation and does not confine them to a narrow legalistic view.	None
For the said purpose, the test required to be adopted is the true character of the company.	None
The initial burden was upon the Respondent No.1 but nothing had been shown so as to hold that the burden shifted to the Appellants herein.	None
ISSUE OF ADDITIONAL 15000 SHARES AND 6475 SHARES TO THE APPELLANTS An Extraordinary General Meeting of the GIC was to be convened pursuant to the Board meeting dated 10.11.1987 wherein a resolution was adopted in the following terms Resolved that an ExtraOrdinary General Meeting of Gaekwad Investment Corporation Private Limited be convened to consider increase issue the capital of the company on Thursday the 17th December 1987 at 11.00 A.M. in the registered office of the company.	None
Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said resolution an Extraordinary General Meeting of the GIC was held wherein a resolution was passed to increase the equity shares by 25000 shares at the rate of Rs. 100/ to the members of the company in the following terms Resolved that Clause V of the Memorandum of Association of Gaekwad Investment Corporation Private Limited be changed as under That the authorised capital of the Company shall consist of Rs. 1,00,00,000/ (Rupees One Crore) divided into 25,000 equity shares of Rs.	None
100/ each and 75,000 four percent.	None
Noncumulative Irredeemable Preference Shares of Rs	None
. 100/. Resolved that capital clause of the Articles of Association of Gaekwad Investment Corporation Private Limited be changed as under That the Authorised Capital of the Company shall consist of Rs. 1,00,00,000/ (Rupees one crore) divided into 25,000 equity shares of Rs.100/ each and 75,000 four per cent Noncumulative Irredeemable Preference Shares of Rs.	None
100/ each.	None
Further Resolved that the Board of Directors of the Company be and is hereby authorized to issue 25,000 equity shares to any members they deem fit.	None
Further Resolved that in the event of the company being wound up on reduction of capital or otherwise the holders of the said Irredeemable Preference Shares shall be entitled to the surplus assets of the company applied in the first place in repaying to them the amount paid up on the irredeemable preference shares held by them respectively but shall not be entitled to any further participation in such surplus assets.	None
In case of reduction of capital of the equity share capital, the holders of equity capital shall not be entitled for repayment unless consent of the irredeemable preference share holders is obtained.	None
Further Resolved that the holders of the said preference shares shall not have any right to vote on any resolution placed before the company unless if directly affects the rights attached to their preference shares even if the dividend is not paid for any number of years, however, will have a right to vote only on those resolutions which will affect their interests.	None
However, on 8.1.1988, the Board decided to issue 15000 shares out of 25000 shares to its members at that time.	None
On or about 12.2.1988, a notice was issued asking the members for acceptance and remit cheque covering the full amount as regard shares allotted to them in three weeks, i.e. by 10th March, 1988.	None
Issuance of the aforementioned notice is not disputed.	None
The appellant No.	None
I herein in the company petition filed by Respondent No.1 alleged that prior to the Managing Committee meeting a Board meeting was also held.	None
Similar assertion was made in his affidavit dated 11.4.1992 in C.P. No. 7 of 1992.	None
Reference to the Managing Committee meeting, however, was not made by the Appellant No.1 in his affidavit dated 10.12.1992 in C.P. No. 13 of 1992, but it is of not much consequence as would appear from the discussions made hereinafter.	None
However, it appears that with a view to give effect to aforementioned letter dated 12.2.1988, a meeting of the Board of Directors was held on 13.2.1988 wherein FRG was present.	None
In the said meeting, the following resolution was adopted The Board confirmed the minutes of the Directors Meeting held on 8th January, 1988.	None
It was reported to the Board that necessary action has been taken on the Agenda of the Board Meeting held on 8th January, 1988.	None
The Financial Position of the Company was discussed at length.	None
The Board was informed that letters have been addressed on 12th February, 1988 to the shareholders informing them that the company has issued 15000 equity shares of Rs.	None
100/ each to the members and to convey their acceptance on or before 10th March 1988.	None
The company would know the amount, the company would receive from them.	None
The said meeting bears the signature of the Secretary to the Chairman.	None
However, although in her original pleadings the factum of issuance of such circular letter dated 12.2.1988 had not been denied or disputed but in her rejoinder to the reply she said so.	None
The said stand apparently was taken by way of afterthought and, thus, cannot be accepted.	None
We, moreover, do not see any reason to come to the conclusion as has been done by the Division Bench of the High Court that the said meeting was not held at all.	None
The Company being a family company, the minutes of the said meeting, which bear the signature of the Appellant No.1 herein, should not be discarded.	None
In the pleadings, it was accepted, as would appear from the discussions made hereinafter, that a decision had been taken to broadbase the company by the Board of Directors during the life time of FRG himself who participated in the meetings.	None
His Secretary had furthermore endorsed the draft minutes of one of the meetings which was in the handwriting of N.K.K. Mohammed and the Chairman (FRG) had okayed the same.	None
The said draft minutes are annexed to the company petition of the Respondent No.1 herself.	None
Further Mr. M.N. Khade, Company Secretary had confirmed the facts relating to the issue of allotment of 15000 shares.	None
The 31st Annual General Meeting of GIC held on 30th September, 1989 in this situation assumes importance.	None
In the said meeting the annual accounts together with Directors Report and Auditors Report for the year ended 31st March, 1989 were discussed at length and the following resolution was passed Resolved that the Directors Report and the Audited accounts of the Company for the year ended 31st March, 1989 placed before the meeting be and the same are hereby received and adopted.	None
The minutes of this meeting were signed by Mr. P.U. Rana, Director of the Company.	None
It appears that Balance Sheet as on 31.3.1989 clearly indicated the issue of additional equity share capital being 10,5000 equity shares of Rs. 100 each.	None
The amount of loan of Rs. 15 lakhs from Shantadevi is clearly shown under unsecured loans, remaining amounts have also been advanced to the company by way of loan No dispute was raised in the said meeting as regard the aforementioned transactions.	None
Furthermore, Annual Return of this meeting held on 30th September, 1989 was filed before the Registrar of Companies, Gujarat at Ahmedabad on 30.11.1989.	None
Mr. H.A. Shinde wrote a letter to Registrar of Companies.	None
The Annual Return was signed by Mr. P.U. Rana and Mr. H.A. Shinde.	None

Thus, the above allotment of 10500 equity shares was confirmed and accepted in the 31st Annual General Meeting of G.I.C. All disputes which are now being raised about the issue of additional capital of 10,500 equity shares cannot be raised since the allotment is confirmed ratified in the said Annual General Meeting.	None
We would, however, deal with the question as regard validity of allotment of 3000 shares in favour of the appellants and 500 shares allotted in favour of the Respondent No.12 separately.	None
Furthermore, taking a view of the admitted unequivocal stand taken by Respondent No.1 as also by Respondent No.12 in Company Petition No. 7 of 1992, the High Court was not correct in holding that the party should be relegated back to the same position as if no additional shares other than 425 shares were issued and in that view of the matter the reliefs granted by the Division Bench appear to be selfcontradictory and inconsistent with each other.	Reasoning
If the only relief to which the Respondent Nos. 1, 12 and 13 became entitled to that all additional shares over and above 425 original shares should be directed to be cancelled, the question of Respondent No. 1s entitlement to further 8000 shares from the additional 15000 shares would not arise.	Reasoning
Her claim in this behalf is not only wholly inconsistent but also selfdestructive.	Reasoning
It is difficult to believe that the contesting respondents herein were not aware of the decision of the Board of Directors to broadbase the company and allotment of 8000 shares in favour of FRG out of the same.	Reasoning
Mr. Desai assails the findings of learned Single Judge contending that if FRG was not inclined to subscribe to 8000 shares kept apart for him, there was absolutely no reason as to why he should acquire 22 shares belonging to the following Shri Ashokraje Gaekwad1	None
Shri R.V. Dhaibar10 Smt.	None
Kusum Desai and Shri Dilip Desai5	None
Shri Dilip Desai and Smt.	None
Kusum Desai5	None
Shri M.N. Khade1	None
All the aforementioned shares are held by the outsiders.	None
The very fact that the Board had approved the transfer of aforementioned 22 shares is also indicative of the fact that had FRG been interested in subscribing 8000 shares, he would have applied and paid the requisite amount therefore and as he did not take any such step, it is difficult to hold that the offer became a firm one.	None
Furthermore, the very fact that some outsiders have transferred shares in favour of FRG also belies the argument of Mr. Desai to the effect that the intrinsic value thereof was Rs. 1 lakh or 2 lakh per share.	None
Had this been so, there was no reason for the outsiders to transfer their shares in the name of FRG.	None
It was, therefore, not a case where FRG would to try to consolidate his position by purchasing 22 shares.	None
Some other considerations therefore must have weighed with him.	None
One of them may be that he intended to oust the outsiders.	None
FRG admittedly was Chairman of the company till his death.	None
No dispute was raised by any member as regard allotment of shares during his life time.	None
The findings of the Division Bench that he had full interest in the company shares may not be correct inasmuch as had that been the position, he would have definitely opted for allotment of 8000 shares in his name.	None
In any event, he would have opposed allotment of 7500 shares in the name of Appellant and Respondent Nos. 12 and 13 if he intended to consolidate his position as had been opined by Division Bench of the High Court.	None
It is not necessary for us to dwell at length the question as to whether there had been an express renunciation by FRG in relation to 8000 shares allotted to him as the letter dated 11.6.1988 purported to have been written by Shri Khade to the Appellant No.1 is disputed.	None
Even if we proceed on the basis that there had been no express renunciation by FRG as regards 8000 shares allotted in his favour, there may not be any doubt whatsoever that in law, having regard to the fact that he acquired only a personal interest therein, the same came to an end with his death.	None
In absence of any documentary evidence, it is also difficult for us to accede to the contention raised on behalf of the Respondents herein that the Respondent Nos. 1 and 12 advanced a sum of Rs. 15 lakhs each without any interest and, thus, they were in a position to purchase 8000 shares.	None
The fact remains that the same had not been done.	None
The fact remains that advancement of loan by both Respondent Nos. 1 and 12 whether with or without interest stands accepted, which was done in November, 1988.	None
However, the question as to whether an interest of 14 per annum was payable thereon or not is in dispute.	None
According to the Appellants, however, TDS had been deducted on the interest amount and the certificates had been issued by GIC.	None
There is also no gainsaying that at least Mrs. Puar was having full knowledge as regards floating of additional shares.	None
She even in her affidavit did not explain as to under what circumstances she had applied for allotment of only 1000 shares and not more.	None
It is inconceivable having regard the tenor of her letter of May 1988 that she was asked the Appellant No.1 to send a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/ towards purchase of share by Appellant No.1 and she complied with the said request without knowing the implication thereof.	None
There is no allegation (much less proof) that she even made inquiries as regard the status of allotments.	None
She being the managing director of a subsidiary of GIC, it is difficult to believe that she was entirely oblivious to the share issue of GIC having a very small capital base of 425 shares.	None
She had moreover sent two cheques of Rs. 80,000 and 20,000 respectively being dated 23rd March, 1988 and 10th May, 1988 and thereby categorically opted to purchase 1000 shares.	None
There is no mention in the said letter that such offer was made at the instance of the Appellant No.1 herein.	None
It is not uncommon to advance loan on interest in preference to purchase of shares as a person may be certain about the return of money visavis the uncertainty as regard purchase of shares as in the case of latter, the person investing in the shares may lose if not entirely, to some extent.	None
Similarly, the question as to why the Appellants herein did not advance any loan to the Company is again a matter of not much consequence, particularly, when the parties have not been examined on oath.	None
It is furthermore not necessary for us to dwell at length the submissions of Mr. Desai as regard effect of absence of any notice of closure.	None
It is futile to go into the question as to whether 14 interest was to be paid on the amount of loan admittedly.	None
Respondent Nos. 1 and 12 advanced the said amount by way of loan only.	None
Only at a later stage, a claim was laid to utilize the amount towards the purchase of 8000 shares.	None
Significantly, although the Respondent No.1 participated in the family meeting dated 23.3.1988 and had received the letter of offer dated 12.2.1988, did not opt for any share.	None
As indicated hereinbefore, she had not claimed for allotment of any share even after the death of FRG which took place on 1st September, 1988.	None
Even in November, 1988, she even did not subscribe for rights issue of BRC and in fact renounced such offer as had been admitted in her rejoinder affidavit filed in Company Petition No. 51 of 1991 to the reply filed by the Appellant No.1 herein.	None
In the said rejoinder a story was made out for the first time that such renunciation was made so that BRC equity shares can be purchased by the family in the name of such persons as was decided.	None
In view of our findings that the Respondent No.1 is estopped and precluded from questioning the allotment of 6475 shares to the Appellant herein.	None
It may not be necessary for us to go into the details of alleged inconsistencies and contradictions in the three minutes of the meetings as also alleged three different versions of the Appellant No.1 herein.	None
Suffice it to point out that the Appellant No.1 alone is not guilty, if at all, of taking inconsistent plea.	None
The contesting Respondents are also guilty to that effect in equal measures.	None
The Respondents herein, as discussed hereinbefore, have taken not only contradictory stand and inconsistent pleas but also prevaricated the same from stage to stage.	None
Even before us different contentions have been raised which were not raised before the learned Single Judge nor were pleaded in the company petition.	None
It must also be placed on records that in the written submissions, several contentions have been raised which were not raised in oral submissions.	None
Moreover, the Respondent No. 12 was given power of attorney by the Respondent No.1.	None
A transaction by a lady who is illiterate or a purdahnashin and a transaction by a lady who looks after the family business family property would be differently viewed.	None
She, being the Managing Director of Alaukik, a subsidiary company of GIC would presumed to know the affairs of the Company as Alaukik on her own showing would be vitally affected by the rights issue.	None
She also chaired a meeting of the Company on 12.10.89.	None
It is, therefore, clear that the dispute was raised despite full knowledge about allotment of shares by different persons only after the Respondent No. 12 got 1500 shares of Alukik allotted in her name as a result whereof the suit No. 675 of 1990 was instituted.	Reasoning
Even in the prayer portion, no relief has been prayed for to set aside the transfer, recession as regard allotment of 6475 shares.	None
In Paragraph (2) while dealing with the contentions of the Respondents purporting to be as regard alleged false statement relating to the issue of 15000 shares and related aspects, the Appellants herein had given in great details the manner in which the company was being managed holding of Board meeting on 10th November, 1997 which was attended by FRG, Appellant No.1 and Mr. P.H. Chinoy wherein it was resolved that an ExtraOrdinary General Meeting be convened on 17th December, 1987 to consider the increase issue of capital of the company.	None
holding of ExtraOrdinary General Meeting of the Company on 17th December, 1987 chaired by Mr. P.U. Rana and attended by Mr. Shinde and Mr. M.N. Khade wherein the financial position of the company in the absence of dividend income was discussed and resolution was adopted that company would issue 25000 equity shares to any members as the Board of Directors deem fit and subsequent thereto and as consequence of the authority given by the shareholders to raise capital, a Board Meeting of the Company was held on 8th January, 1988 wherein Appellant No.1, Mr. P.H. Chinoy, Mr. P.U. Rana were present and after discussion, it was resolved that 15000 equity shares of Rs. 100 each be issued at par to the members of the company.	None
The issuance of a circular letter dated 12.2.1988 pursuant to or in furtherance of the said resolution to all members of the company.	None
But in para 10 of her reply to the said affidavit, Respondent No.12 stated What is stated in Paras II 2(ii)(iii)(iv) (v) of the affidavit in reply is broadly true except that Shri Khade was not only then the Company Secretary of respondent No. 6 Company but still continues to be the Company Secretary.	None
The Respondent No.1, therefore, accepted and admitted the allegations made by the Appellant No.1 herein by reason of nontraversal of the said pleadings.	None
It is interesting to note that the Respondent No.1 in her rejoinder categorically stated that everybody received the circular letter and even Appellant No.1 did not apply for the shares pursuant thereto but the same had not been replied to.	None
In the aforementioned situation, in our considered opinion, she cannot now be permitted to turn around and contend that there was no requirement to raise any kind or there was no valid reason to increase the capital of GIC by issues of shares.	None
Once it is held that the decision to issue 15000 additional shares was validity taken, out of which 6475 shares were allotted to the Appellants, the Appellants were in majority.	None
Furthermore, there does not appear to be any reason as to why the Respondents herein despite knowledge did not object thereto.	None
No sufficient material has been brought on records to satisfy us that the minutes of the said Board meeting dated 13.2.1988 was a forged and fabricated one.	Reasoning
However, it is not disputed that no offer was received upto 10th March, 1988.	Reasoning
The stand of the Appellants herein is that the said date was later on extended.	Reasoning
However, on 21.3.1988 6475 shares were allotted in terms of the said Resolution to Appellant No.1 herein, 8000 shares were allotted to FRG, 500 shares to Mrs. Mrunalini Devi Puar and 25 shares to Mrs. Shubhangini Raje.	Reasoning
Furthermore, it was an adhoc allotment and not a confirmed one.	Reasoning
Let us now consider the effect of three draft minutes of meetings which are placed on records by the parties.	None
Admittedly on 21.3.1988, a meeting was held.	None
Draft minute No.1, although was unsigned and sent with a covering letter of Mr. Khade on or about 29.3.1988 in the following manner The Committee considered the allotment of 15000 Equity Shares of Rs.	None

Shrimant Sangramsingh Gaekwad Shri P.H. Chinoy Shri Sangramsingh Gaekwad was in the Chair.	None

100/ each of the Company offer letter dated 12th February, 1988 have been sent to the Shareholders of the Company requesting them to convey their acceptance for the number of shares they would like to subscribe alongwith their cheques for the full amount of Share.	None
Subscription accepted by them.	None
Out of these additional Equity Shares it is decided to issue 51 additional Equity Share Capital to Lt. Col. Dr. Fatehsinghrao Gaekwad and the balance 49 to be issued to the existing members depending on the offer accepted by them.	None
In case the existing members do not subscribe to the additional Share Capital offered to them in terms of the letter of offer dated 12th February, 1988 sent to all the members of the Company, it was decided to offer these Equity Share Capital remaining unsubscribed to the persons as the Committee deems fit.	None
As there was no other business, the meeting terminated.	None
Sd Chairman The apparent difference between the first and second versions of the meeting is that whereas the words and others appear after the words Chairman, Sangramsingh Gaekwad, in the second one the same is missing.	None
However, having regard to the endorsement made therein the genuineness whereof has not been doubted or disputed and moreover, as in sum and substance the contents of both the meetings are same, the fact that 6475 shares were allotted to Sangramsingh Gaekwad, the Appellant No.1 herein is beyond any doubt particularly when such a fact stands admitted by the Respondent No.1 in the company petition itself.	None
The purported third minute, however, had been filed by Mrs. Puar in her company petition, the correctness whereof is in question.	None
Even in the second draft of the minutes of meeting however, it was mentioned that the shares will be allotted in the name asked for by the above parties and, thus, there may not be in variance of substance in the two drafts.	None
According to Mrs. Shandadevi Gaekwad, Respondent No.1 herein and others, it was a family meeting (para 6.5 of the company petition).	None
She has also annexed the draft minutes of the meeting with the said petition and further annexed allotment ratio discussed at the meeting.	None
The draft minutes forwarded by Mr. M.N. Khade had also been annexed in the company petition.	None
It may, therefore, be safe to opine that the purported family meeting was in fact a Board meeting of which the parties were fully aware of.	None
The minutes of the said meeting clearly suggest that the shares were to be allotted if an offer to that effect was made together with the tender of value thereof whereupon the shares would be allotted in the names of the persons as asked by the above parties.	None
Liberty, thus, was given to all the parties named in the said minutes of the meeting to either apply for shares in their own names or in the names of any other person of their choice.	None
In that view of the matter, the words written by hand and others as contained in the first draft of the meeting may not be of much significance.	None
Furthermore, as noticed hereinbefore, the said draft minute was sent by Mr. M.N. Khade with a covering letter.	None
In the company petition, the issuance of the said letter and the ratio of allotment having not been denied or disputed, we have to proceed on the basis that the contents of the said minutes of meetings are correct.	None
Even in law, shares can be allotted as and when the amounts were received.	None
Admittedly, all the family members had participated in the issue even if the last date of offer dated 10.3.1988 had expired.	None
The restriction as regard time of allotment, thus, may not be of much significance.	None
Another aspect of the matter also cannot also be lost sight of 6475 shares were allotted in the name of the Appellants as also in the names of SPG, HUF were allotted between April and June, 1988.	None
Mrs. Shubhanginidevi Gaekwad was allotted 25 shares and Mrs. Puar was allotted 1000 shares on or about 30.5.1988.	None
All the share certificates had been issued which bear the signatures of Appellant No.1 and Mr. H.A. Shinde, Directors of Company and countersigned by Mr. M.N. Khade.	None
It is apparent from the records that Shri Shinde and Shri Khade are now siding with the Respondents and have filed affidavits in support of their case.	None
It is also of some significance to note that out of two cheques of Rs. 80,000 and Rs. 20,000 issued by Respondent No.12 for purchase of 1000 shares, one is dated 23rd March, 1988 and the other is dated 10th May, 1988.	None
It is, therefore, difficult to accept having regard to the aforementioned fact situation that the Respondent No. 12 was not aware of the affairs of the company.	None
If she had no knowledge about the issue of the shares, we wonder how she could draw a cheque in March, 1988.	None
We, therefore, are of the opinion that in relation to allotment of 7500 shares, Mrs. Puar and Mrs. Shubhanginidevi Gaekwad and estopped and precluded from questioning the allotment having received the benefit thereof and having full knowledge thereabout all along.	None
An attempt has been made by Mr. Desai to show that some contradictory and inconsistent statements have been made by the Appellant No.1 herein his affidavits dated 21st March, 1991, 10th April, 1992 and 10th December, 1992.	None
For the views we have taken, it is not necessary to go into the said question as also the question as to whether in fact time for actual payment towards allotment of shares had been extended or not.	None
Shantadevi in her company petition categorically stated that prior to filing of petition under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act, she made inspection of the records of the company and obtained notorised copy thereof on 10th December, 1990.	None
At the time of filing the said company petition concededly she had complete knowledge of the affairs of the company as reflected from the documents maintained at the Registered Office of the Company.	None
On her own showing, Mr. P.U. Rana who was a director of the company had at her request gave her inspection of the registers including company registers, minute book, share registers, etc.	None
Relying on or on the basis of the said documents, Respondent No.1.	None
herein categorically stated (6.5) It was decided and agreed in the said family meeting and also subsequently in a meeting of the Companys Board of Directors, that out of the 15,000 equity shares, 8000 equity shares would be allotted to Shri Fatehsinhrao Gaekwad, 500 equity shares to Shrimati Mrunalini Devi Puar, the sister of Shri Fatehsinhrao Gaekwad, 25 shares to Princess Shubhangini Raje and 6475 shares for Shri Sangramsinh Gaekwad, the First Respondent herein.	None
Despite such categorical admissions in the pleadings, a statement was made across the bar that at the time of filing of the Company Petition the Respondent No.1 herein did not have all informations which came to light at a much later stage.	None
It was urged that only with a view to obtain complete reliefs, prayers made in the company petition were amended and reliefs had been granted by the High Court keeping in view the pleadings and affidavits filed by the parties in all the three matters.	None
We have our own doubts how far the procedure adopted were correct when in a case of oppression the court must strictly go by the pleadings made in the application.	None
The provisions of the Civil Procedure Code do not envisage that pleadings in any other case should be the basis for grant of relief, particularly, when the plea taken in both the petitions are contradictory and inconsistent with each other.	None
Before us affidavits from different proceedings made by the same person or by the other supporting or opposing the application have been placed.	None
They have not been crossexamined.	None
Their attention had not been drawn to their earlier statements which could be done only in terms of Section 145 of the Evidence Act.	None
With the view to elicit the truth the court must have before it a clear picture.	None
In this case, unfortunately, the parties herein have not made any efforts to examine themselves themselves in court so as to enable the other side to crossexamine them.	None
Had the parties to the proceedings been examined and crossexamined, the could have been confronted with the earlier statements made by them in another affidavit.	None
In Needle Industries (supra), this Court has frowned upon such practices.	None
Similarly, Mrs. Puar in her rejoinder to the counteraffidavit filed by the Appellants herein Company Petition No. 7 of 1992 accepted that during the life time of FRG and to his knowledge, a decision to broadbase company by issuing 25000 shares out of which 15000 at the first instance was taken.	None
It also stands admitted from one or the other minutes of meetings referred to in her petition that out of the 15000 shares 6475 shares were to be allotted to the Appellants herein.	None
In view of the fact that the presence of FRG in the decision making process to broadbase the company, the authority of FRG as regards control of the company had never been disputed and his presence in one of the Board meetings, the plea of issuance of additional shares has sufficiently been established.	Reasoning
A decision to which FRG is a party can only give rise to a question of oppression on his part and no one else.	Reasoning
In any event, such a case has never been made out that FRG was guilty of commission of any acts of oppression or mismanagement had been committed while he was the chairman of the company.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the Respondent No.1 failed to substantiate the charge of oppression on the ground of issuance of 6475 shares in favour the Appellants.	Reasoning
CLAIM OF THE FIRST RESPONDENT IN RESPECT OF 8000 SHARES 141 The First Respondent herein claimed 8000 shares evidently relying on or on the basis of such allotment on the sole ground that on the death of FRG, the same was inherited by her as a ClassI heir.	None
She raised a grievance only as regards allotment of 3000 shares to the Respondents Nos. 3 and 4 herein, as would appear from a perusal of the allegations made in the company petition and on a reasonable construction thereof.	None
The allotments made to the parties including 8000 shares were provisional in nature and as such shares were to be allotted on payment, as is evident from the minutes of the meeting.	None
No other person except the Appellants herein, Mrs. Puar and Mrs. Shubhangini Devi opted for allotment of shares to the extent of 6475, 1000 and 25 shares respectively.	None
It is not in dispute that upon demise of FRG, Respondent No.1 applied for grant of succession certificate on 28.11.1989 wherein the disclosed the assets of FRG but except for his 22 shares in GIC, no claim for any other share was made far less her right as regard 8000 shares.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also not in dispute that the matter relating to her claim to succeed FRG as his Class	None
I heir is pending adjudication in Civil Suit No. 725/1991 in Baroda Civil Court.	None
She claimed title in respect of 8000 shares by inheritance in terms of Hindu Succession Act.	None
Indisputably, in terms of Section 15 of the said Act she is a Class I heir	None
but the Appellants herein contended that the said provision has no application having regard to Section 5(2) thereof as inheritance in the family is governed by the rule of primogeniture.	None
A pure question of title is alien to an application under Section 397 of the Companies Act wherefor the lack of probity is the only test.	None
Furthermore, it is now wellsettled that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not completely ousted by the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956.	None
(See Dwarka Prasad Agarwal vs. Ramesh Chander (Agarwal (2003) 6 SCC 220 ).	None
A dispute as regard right of inheritance between the parties is eminently a civil dispute and cannot be said to be a dispute as regards oppression of minority shareholders by the majority shareholders and or mismanagement.	None
Furthermore, in the said suit when an application for interim injunction was filed only, a prima facie observation was made to the effect that the succession was not to be governed by Hindu Succession Act.	None
Such observations do not constitute a binding decision as no finality is attached thereto.	None
The matter came upto this Court in S.L.Ps.	None
(C) No. 17018/95 and 17020/95 which were disposed of observing We may also allay the fears of the petitioner regarding the observations made by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in his order now impugned while accepting the appeals against him.	None
It is made clear that those observations are not meant to be final, but have obviously been made to dispose of the claim to temporary injunction which shall keep confined to that limited exercise without affecting the merits of the case.	None
This disposes of the Special Leave Petitions.	None
Our attention has been drawn to an interlocutory proceedings in the suit relating to title, wherein allegedly a prima facie case was not found in favour of the Appellants herein but this Court is not concerned therewith as it has been accepted at the Bar that keeping in view of the fact that the question is subjudice, this Court would not go into the said issue.	None
In fact, Mr. Desai, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent No.1, has given up the same.	None
The finding of the Division Bench of the High Court to the effect that the Respondent No.1 is entitled to get 8000 shares which was firm allotment made to FRG is, thus, not sustainable in law.	Reasoning
Moreover, the allotment in favour of the members of the Company was provisional in nature which would amount to invitation to offer and not an offer.	None
A right to a share would fructify only when an offer made by the company is accepted.	None
Only upon acceptance of such offer, a binding contract comes into being.	None
A right, as is well known, fructifies only upon conclusion of a contract and not prior thereto.	None
When a share is allotted in favour of a person as a member of the company, it becomes his personal right.	None
Such a personal right is not heritable.	None
By reason of a mere provisional allotment without making any payment therefor no legal right in the shares was created.	None
It would also be of some interest to note that even initial allotment of shares cannot be transferred.	None
In Canbank Financial Services Ltd. vs. The Custodian and others (JT 2004(7) SC 266 ), it has been held The allotment of CANCIGOS is not a transfer as thereby Canbank Mutual Fund had allowed the shares not as owner thereof.	None
The Benami Transactions Act applies when there is a transaction in which the property is transferred.	None
If allotment of CANCIGOS is not a transfer of property, the Act would not apply.	None
(See Sri Raj Sachdeva vs. Board of Revenue (AIR 1959 All 595 ), and The Swadeshi Cotton Mills, Co. Ltd., In re. (1932 Comp.	None
Cas 411).	None

Madura Mills Co. Ltd.	None
In Re (1937 Comp.	None
Cas 71), Varadachariar, J., stated the law thus As we have already observed, it is no doubt true that in the hands of a shareholder, a share is property and when a shareholder exchanges his shares with another it may be possible to regard the transaction as amounting to a transfer whether by way of exchange or conveyance Cf.	None
Coats vs. Inland Revenue Commissioners (1897) 2 Q.B. 423.	None
But when the company is for the first time issuing shares, it seems to us that there is no question of property already possessed by the company being thereby transferred to the allottee.	None
In Needle Industries (supra), this Court opined We see no substance in Shri Narimans contention that the letter of offer could not have been sent to the Holding Company without first obtaining the RBIs ap	None
The Division Bench of the High Court treated the allotment to be a confirmed one purported to be relating to Regulation 28 of the Table A of the Companies Act.	Reasoning
The said provision has no application in the facts and circumstances of this case.	Reasoning
ISSUE OF 3000 SHARES The allotment of 3000 shares, however, stand on a different footing.	None
The conduct of the Appellants in this regard would call for a closer scrutiny.	None
There is no proof of express renunciation of his 8000 shares by FRG in favour of the Appellant.	None
It is true that the Respondent No.1 herein although questioned the allotment of 3000 shares given to the son and daughter of the Appellant Nos. 1 and 2 herein, no such challenge was made as regards 500 shares allotted to Respondent No.12.	None
It is also true that the dividend had been paid for the year ending 31.3.1991 at the rate of 10 and 300 respectively to both Respondent Nos. 12 and 13 in respect of 1000 shares and 25 shares held by them respectively.	None
But this action on the part of the contesting respondents would not validate the transaction as regard issuance of 3000 shares in favour of the Appellants.	None
Even assuming that the children of the Appellant Nos. 1 and 2 became members, in relation to the shares originally allotted to Fatehsingh Gaekwad, as was submitted by Mr. Jethmalani, no further circular or notice to the shareholders about the availability thereof had been issued.	None
Even the Appellant No.1 in his affidavit has contradicted himself by making inconsistent statements.	None
Furthermore, in absence of any resolution by the Board of Directors, no offer could be made to the Respondent No.12 as regard 500 shares out of 8000 shares which were allotted to FRG.	None
The Appellants herein have utterly failed to prove that there has been any renunciation of 8000 shares by Fatehsinh Gaekwad or any resolution was taken in this behalf of the Board.	Reasoning
We have grave doubt about the authenticity of the letter of the Company Secretary of FRG renouncing his shares.	Reasoning
Even allotment of 500 shares in favour of Respondent No. 12 out of aid 8000 shares is invalid.	Reasoning
In that view of the matter, the contentions of the Appellant No. 1 to the effect that his children, Pratapsinh S. Gaekwad and Priyadarshiniraje S. Gaekwad applied for further 3000 shares through him and in view of the availability of shares, the Board of the Company decided to issue and allotted the said 3000 shares to them cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
It also does not appear that the Board of Directors or the Management Committee took any resolution to allot shares to allot shares to the other members out of the said 8000 shares.	Reasoning
It is also difficult to accept the efforts had been made by the Appellant No.1 to find out if any other member would like to offer subscription of shares of the company as alleged by him and that efforts had also been made to find out subscribers for those shares.	Reasoning
We, therefore, are of the opinion that the transactions relating to issue of 3000 additional shares in the names of the Appellant Nos. 3 to 5 and 500 shares to the Respondent No. 12 out of the 8000 shares originally allotted to FRG are bad in law.	Reasoning
TRANSFER IGNORING RIGHT OF PREEMPTION Article 3 of the Company states that the Company is a private company and the right of transfer is restricted in the manner provided for therein.	None
Article 4 provides for capital of the Company.	None
Article 5 provides that the share in the capital of the Company for the time being would be under the control of the Directors who may allot or otherwise dispose of the same to such persons in such persons in such proposition and on such terms and conditions and either at a premium or at par or at a discount.	None
Article 6 provides that the transfer of shares shall be restricted in the manner to the extent provided in Articles 7 to 15 thereof.	None
Article 7 of the Articles of Association of the company provides for embargo in favour of a person who is not a member of a company and thus postulates the policy of transfer first to a member only.	None
Article 8 provides for a notice to transfer for a fair value.	None
A transfer notice is not revocable except with the sanction of the Directors.	None
Upon receipt of such notice, if the company finds out a person who intends to purchase the same, a notice of the Proposing Transferor shall be issued.	None
Article 10 provides for valuation of shares by the auditors in case of any difference between the Proposing Transferor and Purchasing Member Article 12, however, provides that if the company does not find a Purchasing Member and give notice in the matter stated in Article 9 with a period of 28 days after being served with a transfer notice, the Proposing Transferor shall at any time within three months afterwards be at liberty subject to Article 16 thereof to sell the share to any person and at any price.	None
Article 14 envisages transfer to a member of the family in respect whereof the embargo contained in Articles 7 to 13 would not apply.	None
Only when a share is to be transferred by a member to an outsider being a person of his choice other than those specified in Article 14, the requirements contained in the aforementioned Articles are required to be complied with.	None
Article 15 provides for registration of transfer whereas Article 16 empowers the Directors to register any transfer or transmission of a share without assigning any reason except in a case where the transferee is a member of the Company or in whose favour the transferee has been effected in terms of Article 14.	None
Indreni is a wholly owned company of the Appellants.	Facts
Such a family company may be considered to be a quasipartnership.	None
The learned Single Judge lifted its corporate veil and held that having regard to the nature of the investment made by the family the transfer may not be held to be illegal.	None
However, in law no transfer could be made in favour of a body corporate having regard to the Articles of Association of the Company.	None
In any event when a notice to the company by a member is vitiated the same can be withdrawn in law.	None
Furthermore a transfer in violation of Article is void (See Palmers Company Law, 23rd Edition 22 14)	None
In the instant case the actual notice of transfer has not been produced.	None
However, a letter has been brought on record to show that Mr. Khade was asked to serve the notice to the members of the company which he did not.	None
Mr. Desai submitted that a notice of transfer had already been issued the same become irrevocable which entitled the Appellants to opt for purchasing the shares on a prorata basis.	None
The said submission of Mr. Desai cannot be accepted as it is not the case of the Respondents that the said notice was acted upon and the provisions of Article 9 to 11 had been complied with.	None
It may be noticed that in the suits filed by the shareholders against the Appellant relating to transfer of shares in favour of Indreni, except in suit No. 872 of 1990, no prayer for prorata allotment thereof in favour of other members had been made.	None
The contents of the said circular letter appear to be vague inasmuch as how many shares are proposed to be transferred had not been stated therein.	None
Furthermore, no action having been taken within a period of 28 days from the date of issuance of such notice, the proposed transferee is entitled to transfer the shares to any person of his choice.	None
It is now wellsettled that only one preemptive offer is to be made which is otherwise to be accepted or not at all.	Reasoning
The existing shareholders are not entitled to be given further preemptive rights in respect of those unaccepted shares.	Reasoning
Even such a right can be waived or modified.	Reasoning
In any event, the transfer has been rescinded in terms of the resolution passed in a meeting dated 9.8.1990.	None
At this stage, it is not necessary to consider the validity or otherwise of the said meeting as no sufficient materials except the factum of payment to Indreni had been brought on records to show that the said resolution dated 13.7.1990/9.8.1990 adopted by the Board are forged and fabricated.	None
In any event, it is not necessary to go into the details of the matter as the three suits filed by the Respondents are pending in different courts of law.	None
It has further to be borne in mind that a preemptive right is granted in favour of a member of a private company so that his right of control is not taken away.	Reasoning
Exercise of such preemptive rights is particularly needed in relation to those private companies which are essentially incorporated partnerships.	Reasoning
(See Grower and Daviss Principles of Modern Company Law Seventh Edition page 635).	Reasoning
As the notice of transfer itself was rescinded, we are of the view that Indrani was not required to transfer the said shares back to the Appellants.	Reasoning
In any event, the title in relation to the aforementioned shares is a matter between the Appellants and the Indreni and the Respondents herein cannot have any say therein.	Reasoning
For the foregoing reasons, we are of the opinion that the Division Bench of the High Court committed a serious error in holding that the transfer by the Appellants in favour of the said Indreni being bad in law, the member of the company were entitled to allotment thereof on prorata basis.	Reasoning
OPPRESSION AND MISMANAGEMENT Sections 397 of the Companies Act reads as under 397(1).	None
Any member of a company who complain that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest or in a manner oppressive to any member or members (including any one or more of themselves) may apply to the Company Law Board for an order under this section provided such members have a right so to apply in virtue of Section 399.	None
If, on any application under subsection (1), the Company Law Board is of the opinion (a) that the companys affairs are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest or in a manner oppressive to any member or members and (b) that to wind up the company would unfairly prejudice such member or members, but that otherwise the facts would justify the making of a winding up order on the ground that it was just and equitable that the company should be wound up the Company Law Board may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters have a right so to apply in virtue of Section 399.	None
If, on any application under subsection (1) the Company Law Board is of the opinion (a) that the companys affairs are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest or in a manner oppressive to any member or members and (b) that to wind up the company would unfairly prejudice such member or members, but that otherwise the facts would justify the making of a winding up order on the ground that it was just and equitable that the company should be wound up the Company Law Board may, with a view to bringing to an end the matters complained of make such order as it thinks fit.	None
Section 398 provides for relief in cases of mismanagement in the following terms Application to Company Law Board for relief in cases of mismanagement.	None
(1)  Any members of a company who complain  (a) that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest or in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company or (b) that a material change (not being a change brought about by, or in the interests of, any creditors including debenture holders or any class or shareholders of the company has taken place in the management or control of the company, whether by an alteration in its Board of directors or manager or in the ownership of the companys shares, or if it has no share capital, in its membership, or in any other manner whatsoever, and that by reason of such change, it is likely that the affairs of the company will be conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest or in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company may apply to the Company Law Board for an order under this section, provided such members have a right so to apply in virtue of section 399.	None
If, on any application under subsection (1), the Company Law Board is of opinion that the affairs of the company are being conducted as aforesaid or that by reason of any material change as aforesaid in the management or control of the company it is likely that the affairs of the company will be conducted as aforesaid the Company Law Board may, with a view to bringing to an end or preventing the matters complained of or apprehended, make such order as it thinks it.	None
Section 402 of the Companies Act provides for the reliefs which may be granted without prejudice to the generally of the powers of the court under the aforementioned provisions.	None
The expression oppressive, it is now wellsettled, would mean burdensome, harsh and wrongful.	None
Oppression complained of, thus, must relate to the manner in which the affairs of the company are being conducted and the conduct complained of must be such as to oppress the minority members.	Reasoning
By reason of such acts of oppression, it must be shown that the majority members obtained a predominant voting power in the conduct of the companys affairs.	Reasoning
The jurisdiction of the Court to grant appropriate relief under Section 397 of the Companies Act indisputably is of wide amplitude.	Reasoning
It is also beyond any controversy that the court while exercising its discretion is not bound by the terms contained in Section 402 of the Companies Act if in a particular fact situation a further relief or reliefs, as the court may seem fit and proper, is warranted (See Bennet Coleman Co.	Reasoning
Vs. Union of India and others (1977) 47 Comp.	Reasoning
Cases 92) and Syed Mahomed Ali vs. R. Sundramurthy and others (AIR 1958 Madras 587).	Reasoning
But the same would not mean that Section 397 provides for a remedy for every act of omission or commission on the part of the Board of Directors.	Reasoning
Reliefs must be granted having regard to the exigencies of the situation and the court must arrive at a conclusion upon analyzing the materials brought on records that the affairs of the company were such that it would be just and equitable to order winding up thereof and that the majority acting through the Board of Directors by reason of abusing their dominant position had oppressed the minority shareholders.	Reasoning
The conduct, thus, complained of must be such so as to oppress minority of the members including the petitioners visavis the shareholders which a fortiorari must be an act of the majority.	Reasoning
Furthermore, the fact situation obtaining in the case must enable the court to invoke just and equitable rules even if a case has been made out for winding up for passing an order of winding of the company but such winding up order would be unfair to the minority members.	Reasoning
The interest of the company visavis the shareholders must be uppermost in the mind of the court while granting a relief under the aforementioned provisions of the Companies Act, 1956.	Reasoning
Mala fide, improper motive and similar other allegations, it is trite, must be pleaded and proved as envisaged in the Code of Civil Procedure.	Reasoning
Acts of mala fide are required to be pleaded with full particulars so as to obtain an appropriate relief.	Reasoning
The remedy under Section 397 of the Companies Act is not an ordinary one.	Reasoning
The acts of oppression must be harsh and wrongful.	Reasoning
An isolated incident may not be enough for grant of relief and continuous course of oppressive conduct on the part of the majority shareholders is, thus, necessary to be proved.	Reasoning
The acts complained of may either be designed to secure pecuniary advantage to the detriment of the oppressors or wrongful usurpation of authority.	Reasoning
In Halsburys Laws of England, 4th Edition, Volume 7, para 1011, it is stated 1011.	None
Conduct amounting to oppression.	None
In this context, oppressive means burdensome, harsh and wrongful.	None
It does not include conduct which is merely inefficient or careless.	None
Nor does it include an isolated incident there must be a continuing course of oppressive conduct, which must be continuing at the date of the hearing of the petition.	None
Further, the conduct must be such as to be oppressive to the petitioner in his capacity as a member whatever remedies he may have in respect of exclusion from the companys business by being dismissed as an employee or a director, he will have none under the provisions relating to oppression.	None
On the other hand, these provisions are not confined merely to conduct designed to secure pecuniary advantage to the oppressors they cover the case of wrongful usurpation of authority, even though the affairs of the company prosper in consequence.	None
It has to be borne in mind that when a complaint is made as regard violation of statutory or contractual right, the shareholder may initiate a proceeding in a civil court but a proceeding under Section 397 of the Act would maintainable only when an extraordinary situation is brought to the notice of the court keeping in view of the wide and farreaching power of the court in relation to the affairs of the company.	Reasoning
In this situation, it is necessary that the alleged illegality in the conduct of the majority shareholders is pleaded and proved with sufficient clarity and precision.	Reasoning
If the pleadings and or the evidence adduced in the proceedings remains unsatisfactory to arrive at a definite conclusion of oppression or mismanagement, the petition must be rejected.	Reasoning
It may be true that the parties had agreed before the High Court that pleading in all connected cases be treated as part of the records of the High Court but by reason thereof it cannot be inferred that although the High Court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the company petition filed by the Respondent No.12 herein filed before the Company Law Board, Delhi and the Company Petition filed by the Respondent No. 1 before the Company Law Board, Bombay, they would be the basis for grant of relief particularly in view of the fact that the reliefs claimed therein are different.	None
After the amendment in the Companies Act, the Company Law Board alone had the jurisdiction to entertain an application under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act, as the jurisdiction of the High Court was ousted thereby and, thus, the allegations made in the Company Petition filed by the Respondent No.12 being company petition No. 7 of 1992 could not have been the subject matter of adjudication by the High Court.	None
It is trite that what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.	None
The conduct and the status of the parties visavis the company also assume significance.	None
Whereas the Respondent No.1 herein claimed relief inter alia as a sole class their of the FRG, the Respondent No. 12 claimed her relief on the basis of being a person involved in protecting the affairs of the Gaekwad family as also in her own right as a shareholder.	None
It is significant, however, that in Suit No. 675 of 1990 pending in the court of Baroda, Gujarat in her written statement the Respondent No. 12 claimed that if her mother had been issued the 8000 shares, her holding together with that of her mothers would exceed 60.	None
The Respondent Nos. 1 and 12 had initiated different proceedings in different forums to suit their own purposes.	None
From the materials brought on records, it can safely be inferred that proceeding before the Company Law Board, Delhi was initiated by the Respondent Nos. 12 herein when it was discovered that the Respondent No.1 may not obtain any relief in the Company Petition filed by her before the Gujarat High Court.	None
The Respondent No.1 in her application did not disclose the grounds for challenging the issue of 6475 shares to the Appellants.	None
In that view of the matter the relief granted by the High Court to the effect that issue of all shares beyond 425 shares is bad in law cannot be sustained having regard to the fact that a bald prayer was made in the petition without laying any foundation therefor in the company petition.	None
Such reliefs evidently had been granted keeping in view the allegations made by the Respondent No.12 in her company petition filed before the Company Law Board, Delhi which is impermissible in law.	None
We may at this juncture have a look to the case laws operating in the field with a view to find out as to what relief, if at all, could be granted to the Respondent No.1 by the Gujarat High Court in the facts and circumstances of the present case.	None
In Shanti Prasad Jain vs. Kalinga Tubes Ltd. etc. (AIR 1965 SC 1535 ), this Court quoted with the approval the following passage from the decision in Elders Case, AIR 1952 SC 49, as summarized at page 394 in Meyers case, AIR 1965 SC 381.	None
Although the word oppressive is not defined it is possible, by way of illustration, to figure a situation in which majority shareholders, by an abuse of their predominant voting power, are treating the company and its affairs as if they were their own property to the prejudice of the minority shareholders and in which just and equitable grounds would exist for the making of a windingup order but in which the alternative remedy provided by Section 210 by way of an appropriate order might well be open to the minority shareholders with a view to bringing to an end the oppressive conduct of the majority.	None
In Shanti Prasad Jain (supra) referring to Elder case, it was categorically held that the conduct complained of must relate to the manner of management of the affairs of the company and must be such so as to oppress a minority of the members including the petitioners qua shareholders.	None
The court, however, pointed out that that law, however, has not defined what oppression is for the purpose of the said Section and it is left to court to decide on the facts of each case whether there is such oppression.	None
In Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society Ltd. vs. Meyer and Another (1958) 3 WLR 404)	None
it was categorically held that the conditions precedents contained in Section 210 of the Act of 1948 must be satisfied before any relief can be granted.	None
Yet again in H.R. Harmer Ltd.	None
In re (1958) 3	None
All ER 689 (CA), the Court of Appeal held that the section does not purport to apply to every case in which the facts would justify the making of a winding up order under the just and equitable rule, but only to those cases of that character which have in them the requisite, element of oppression.	None
It was observed It is not lack of confidence between shareholders per se that brings S.210 into play, but lack of confidence springing from oppression of a minority by a majority in the management of the companys affairs, and oppression involved at least an element of lack of probity or fair dealing to a member in the matter of his proprietary rights as a shareholder.	None
In Needle Industries (supra), this Court observed Coming to the law as to the concept of oppression, Section 397 of our Companies Act follows closely the language of Section 210 of the English Companies Act of 1948.	None
Since the decisions on Section 210 have been followed by our Court, the English decisions may be considered first.	None
The leading case on oppression under Section 210 is the decision of the House of Lords in Scottish Coop.	None
Wholesale Society Ltd. vs. Meyer (1959)	None
AC 324 (1958) 3	None
All ER 66 (HL).	None
Taking the dictionary meaning of the word oppression, Viscount Simonds said at page 342 that the appellantsociety could justly be described as having behaved towards the minority shareholders in an oppressive manner, that is to say, in a manner burdensome, harsh and wrongful.	None
The learned Law Lord adopted, as difficult of being bettered the words of Lord President Cooper at the first hearing of the case to the effect that Section 210 warrants the court in looking at the business realities of the situation and does not confine them to a narrow legalistic view.	None
Dealing with the true character of the company, LordKeith said at page 361 that the company was in substance, though not in law, a partnership, consisting of the society, Dr. Meyer and Mr. Lucas and whatever may be the other different legal consequences following on one or other of these forms of combination, one result followed from the method adopted, which is common to partnership, that there should be the utmost good faith between the constituent members.	None
Finally, it was held that the court ought not to allow technical pleas to defeat the beneficent provisions of Section 210 (page 344, per Lord Keith, pages 36869, per Lord Denning).	None
In Re Five Minute Car Wash Service Ltd. (1966) 1 All ER 242), the Court upon considering the nature of relief which can be granted under Section 210 of the Companies Act, 1948 observed that in a case falling under Section 210 of the Companies Act, 1948, relief will be granted if the petitioner establishes that at the time when the petition was presented the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner oppressive of himself and if he fails to allege facts capable of establishing that the companys affairs are being conducted in such a manner the petition will disclose no ground for granting any relief and must be dismissed in limine.	None
It was observed Those who are alleged to have acted oppressively must be shown to have acted at least unfairly towards those who claim to have been oppressed.	None
In Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society, Ltd. vs. Meyer (a case under section 210) Viscount Simonds adopted a dictionary definition of the meaning of oppressive by, it is said, burdensome, harsh and wrongful.	None
In Elder vs. Elder Watson, Ltd., also a case under section 210, the Lord President (Lord Cooper) said the essence of the matter seems to be that the conduct complained of should at the lowest involve a visible departure from the standards of fair dealing, and a violation of the conditions of fair play on which every shareholder who entrusts his money to a company is entitled to rely.	None
Lord Keith said oppression involves, I think, at least an element of lack of probity or fair dealing to a member in the matter of his proprietary rights as a shareholder.	None
The Court in an application under Sections 397 and 398 may also look to the conduct of the parties.	Reasoning
While enunciating the doctrine of prejudice and unfairness borne in Section 459 of the English Companies Act, the Court stressed the existence of prejudice to the minority which is unfair and not just prejudice per se.	Reasoning
The Court may also refuse to grant relief where the petitioner does not come to court with clean hands which may lead to a conclusion that the harm inflicted upon him was not unfair and that the relief granted should be restricted.	Reasoning
(See Re London School of Electronics, (1986) Ch. 211).	None
Furthermore, when the petitioners have consented to and even benefited from the company being run in a way which would normally be regarded as unfairly prejudicial to their interests or they might have shown no interest in pursuing their legitimate interest in being involved in the company.	Reasoning
(See Re RA Noble Sons (Clothing) Ltd. (1983)	None
BCL C 273).	None
In a given case the Court despite, holding that no case of oppression has been made out may grant such reliefso as to do substantial justice between the parties.	Reasoning
It is now wellsettled that a case for grant of relief under Sections 397 and 398 of the Company Act must be made out in the petition itself and the defects contained therein cannot be cured nor the lacuna filled up by other evidence oral or documentary.	Reasoning
(See In Re Bengal Luxmi Cotton Mills Ltd. (1965 (35) CC 187).	Reasoning
In Shanti Prasad Jain vs. Union of India (75 Bom I.R. 778), it was held that the power of the company court is very wide and not restricted by any limitation contained in Section 402 thereof or otherwise.	None
In Shoe Specialities Ltd. vs. Standard Distilleries and Breweries (P) and Others (1997(1) Comp.	None
LJ 243), it is stated While exercising the powers under sections 397 and 402 of the Companies Act, the Court is considering not only the relief that is sought for but also considers as to what is the nature of the complaint and how the same has to be rectified.	None
It is the interest of the company that is being considered and not the individual dispute between the petitioner and the respondent.	None
If that be so, the interest of the company requires that the majority shareholders must have their say in the management.	None
In Jesner vs. Jarrad Properties (1993) BCLC 1032), a question arose as to whether the conduct and the background of the two companies (their informed way of doing business disregarding the Companies Act, etc.) could be taken into account to decide whether there had been unfair prejudice to one party in an application under Section 459 of the English Companies Act was answered in the affirmative.	None
When a decision is taken on a business consideration, it is trite, the court should not ordinarily interfere.	Reasoning
(See Maharashtra Power Development Corporation Ltd. vs. Dabhol Power Co. and others (2004)	Reasoning

The burden to prove oppression or mismanagement is upon the petitioner.	None
The Court, however, will have to consider the entire materials on records and may not insist upon the petitioner to prove the acts of oppression.	None
An action in contravention of law may not per se be oppressive.	None
Bhagwati, J. (as His Lordship then was) in Mohanlal Ganpatram and another vs. Shri Sayaji Jubilee Cotton and Jute Mills Co. Ltd. and others (AIR 1965 Guj. 96 .	None
at 103) stated the law, thus It may be that a resolution may be passed by the Directors which is perfectly legal in the sense that it does not contravene any provision of law, and yet it may be oppressive to the minority shareholders or prejudicial to the interests of the Company.	None
Such a resolution can certainly be struck down by the Court under Section 397 or 398.	None
Equally a converse case can happen.	None
A resolution may be passed by the Board of Directors which may in the passing contravene a provision of law, but it may be very much in the interests of the Company and of the shareholders.	None
The said decision has been referred to with approval in Needle Industries (supra).	None
(Para 49).	None
The conduct which is technically legal and correct, thus, may justify grant of relief on the application of the just and equitable jurisdiction and conversely that conduct involving illegality and contravention of the Act may not suffice to warrant grant of any remedy Isolated act of oppression may not be sufficient to grant any relief but there should be a continued oppression therefor.	None
The test of lack of bonafide should be applied in both for the winding up petition while determining an application under Section 397 of the Companies Act.	None
(See Re Guidezone Ltd. (2000) 2 BCLC 321).	None
We may at this juncture notice that the Respondent No.1 in her application under Section 397 of the Companies Act did not complain of any act of mismanagement Complaints of mismanagement were made by the Respondent No. 12 only.	None
For the purpose of grant of relief, the High Court could only consider the pleadings filed in Company Petition No. 5 of 1991.	None
If no relief could be granted having regard to the pleadings contained therein, it is inconceivable in law that such relief would be granted on the basis of the pleadings made in other proceedings and totally ignoring the admissions made by the Respondent No.1 herein the proceedings initiated by her.	None
Pleadings and Proof  Legal Requirements We may now consider the submissions of Mr. Desai that the Appellant No.1 herein is guilty of commission of fraud.	None
Application filed by the Respondent No.1 before the Gujarat High Court does not contain the requisite pleadings in this behalf, the requirements wherefor can neither be denied nor disputed.	None
It is not in dispute that having regard to Rule 6 of the Company Courts Rule, the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure will be applicable in a proceeding under the Companies Act.	None
It terms of Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the plaintiff is bound to give particulars of the cases where he relies on misrepresentation, fraud, breach of trust, etc.	None
In Chief Engineer, M.S.E.B. Anr.	None
vs. Suresh Raghunath Bhokare (2004 (8) Supreme 845), this Court held Thus, applying the basic principle of rule of evidence which requires a party alleging fraud to give particulars of the fraud and having found no such particulars the Industrial Court came to the conclusion that the respondent could not be held guilty of fraud.	None
It was observed In the absence of any such particulars being mentioned in the show cause notice or at the trial, attributing some overt act to the respondent, we do not think the Board can infer that the respondent had a role to play in sending a fraudulent list solely on the basis of the presumption that since respondent got a job by the said proposal, said list is a fraudulent one In A.C. Ananthaswamy and others vs. Boraiah (Dead) by LRS.	None
(2004) 8 SCC 588 ), this Court held that the level of proof required for proving fraud is extremely high.	None

Order 6, Rule 17 provides for amendment of the pleading whereas Order 8, Rule 9 provides for subsequent pleadings by a defendant.	None

None
Respondent No. 12 in her application, alleged mismanagement of the Company on the part of the Respondent No.1 the Appellants in their reply while denying and disputing that the company was mismanaged alleged that it had earned profit.	None
In Rejoinder to the said reply, Mrs. Puar questioned the correctness or veracity of the balance sheet of GIC contending that the socalled profit disclosed in the accounts is merely a book entry.	None
A contrary stand, however, has been taken before us suggesting that the shares had been issued by the Appellants unto themselves at a gross undervalue.	None
The question which arises is as to whether the Respondent Nos. 1 and 12 are bound by their own pleadings.	None
It is neither in doubt nor in dispute that the Code of Civil Procedure being applicable to a proceeding of this nature, not only the plea of fraud is required to be specifically pleaded and proved.	None
Even an amendment of pleadings could not have been permitted if thereby the Company Petitioner made an attempt to get rid of her admission.	None
Section 58 of the Indian Evidence Act reads as under Facts admitted need not be proved.	None
No fact need to be proved in any proceedings which the parties thereto or	None
their agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing, they agree to admit by any writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in force at time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings Provided that the court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission.	None
In terms of the aforementioned provision, things admitted need not be proved.	None
In view of the admission of Respondent No.1 alone, the issue as regards allotment of 6475 shares should have been answered in favour of the Appellants.	None
The Company Petitioner at a much later stage could not be permitted to take a stand which was contrary to or inconsistent with the original pleadings nor could she be permitted to resile from her admissions contained therein.	None
Admissions made by the Respondent No.1 was admissible against her proprio vigore.	None
In Nagindas Ramdas vs. Dalpatram Iccharam alias Brijram and others (AIR 1974 SC 471 ), this Court held Admissions if true and clear are by far the best proof of the facts admitted.	None
Admissions in pleadings or judicial admissions admissible under Section 58 of the Evidence Act, made by the parties or their agents at or before the hearing of the case, stand on a higher footing than evidentiary admission.	None
The former class of admissions are fully binding on the party that makes them and constitute a waiver of proof.	None
They by themselves can be made the foundation of the rights of the parties.	None
On the other hand evidentiary admissions which are receivable at the rival as evidence are by themselves not conclusive.	None
They can be shown to be wrong.	None

That admission stands in their way to plead at the later stage that they suffered loss on account of the deficiency in service Judicial Admissions by themselves can be made the foundations of the right of the parties.	None
In M s. Modi Spinning Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. and another vs. M s. Ladha Ram Co. (AIR 1977 SC 680 ), the law is stated in the following terms It is true that inconsistent pleas can be made in pleadings but the effect of substitution of paragraphs 25 and 26 is not making inconsistent and alternative pleadings but it is seeking to displace the plaintiff completely from the admissions made by the defendants in the written statement.	None
If such amendments are allowed the plaintiff will be irretrievably prejudiced by being denied the opportunity of extracting the admission from the defendants.	None
The High Court rightly rejected the application for amendment and agreed with the trial Court.	None
In the instance case, the Respondent No.1 even did not amend the company petition by withdrawing the admissions or resiling therefrom.	None
In Kaveripatnam Subbaraya Setty Annaiah Setty Charities Trust vs. S.K. Viswanatha Setty (2004) 8 SCC 717 ), this Court deprecated raising a plea for the first time before the appellate court without amendment of plaint holding that when materials to substantiate such plea had not been brought on record and, thus, it is impermissible to consider the same, stating However, there is no material placed on record by way of pleadings to show whether the appellant is a religious or charitable institution.	None
The plaint was never amended.	None
The appellant seeks exemption.	None
Exemption needs to be alleged and proved.	None
Opportunity is required to be given to the respondent to meet the plea of exemption.	None
In the circumstances, we are in agreement with the view expressed by the High Court that the said plea was not open to the appellant at the stage of second appeal, particularly, in the absence of any material available to substantiate such plea.	None
In Heeralal vs. Kalyan Mal and others (1998) 1 SCC 278 ), following Modi Spinning (supra), it was observed The facts of the present case are entirely different and consequently the said decision also cannot be of any help for the learned counsel for the respondents.	None

SCR 728 (AIR 1977 SC 680 ).	None
In that case Ray, C.J., speaking for the Bench had to consider the question whether the defendant can be allowed to amend his written statement by taking an inconsistent plea as compared to the earlier plea which contained an admission in favour of the plaintiff.	None
It was held that such an inconsistent plea which would displace the plaintiff completely from the admissions made by the defendants in the written statement cannot be allowed.	None
If such amendments are allowed in the written statement plaintiff will be irretrievably prejudiced by being denied the opportunity of extracting the admissions from the defendants It was also observed In our view, therefore, on the facts of this case and as discussed earlier, no case was made out by the respondents, contesting defendants, for amending the written statement and thus attempting to go behind their admission regarding 5 out of 7 remaining items out of 10 listed properties in ScheduleA of the plaint (See also M s. ABL Ltd., Durgapur, Burdwan vs. Radha Gobinda Ghatak Others (1999 (1) CHN 645 ) and Krishna Gupta and others vs. Madan Lal and others, 2002 (96) DLT 829).	None
In view of the our findings aforementioned, it must be held that having regard to the admission made by the Respondent No.1 in her pleadings as regard broadbasing of the company and issuance of 6475 shares in favour of the Appellants herein and further in absence of any pleading of commission of fraud on the part of the Appellant No.1 herein, the High Court committed a manifest error in issuing the impugned directions.	Reasoning
Once the aforementioned facts are not in question, the company petitioner cannot take a stand different from that raised in her petition simply on the ground that other and further reliefs were claimed by amending the reliefs portion.	Reasoning
Reliefs could be granted by the court had the material facts necessary to prove her case been pleaded and proved.	Reasoning
In absence of any pleading, no evidence would be admissible and the court as is wellknown ordinarily would not grant any relief which has not been pleaded.	Reasoning
QuasiPartnership  Family Company  Corporate Veil A company incorporated under Indian Companies Act is a body corporate.	None
However, in certain situations, its corporate veil can be lifted.	None

The Court, however, has made a clear distinction between a family company, a private company and public limited company.	Reasoning
The true character of the company, the business realities of the situation should not be confined to a narrow legalistic view.	Reasoning
(See Needle Industries (supra).	Reasoning
It is now wellknown that principles of quasipartnership is not foreign to the concept of Companies Act.	Reasoning
For the purpose of grant of relief the principles of partnership had been applied even in a public limited company.	Reasoning
(See Loch and another vs. John Blackwood Ltd., 1924 AC 783, Ebrahimi vs. Westbourne Galleries Ltd. and others (1972 (2) All ER 492).	None
The principles applicable to the winding up of a company contained in Section 44(g) of the Indian Partnership Act was applied in a winding up petition under Section 433(f) of the Companies Act by a 3Judge Bench of this Court in Hind Overseas Private Ltd. vs. Raghunath Prasad Jhunjhunwalla and another (AIR 1976 SC 565 ) following Ebrahimi (supra).	None
However, it was observed that when more than one family or several friends and relatives together form a company and there is no right as such agreed upon for active participation of members were sought to be excluded from management, the principles of dissolution of partnership cannot be liberally invoked.	None
In Kilpest Pvt. Ltd. and others vs. Shekhar Mehra (1996) 10 SCC 696 ), it was stated The promoters of a company, whether or not they were hitherto partners, elect to avail of the advantages of forming a limited company.	None
They voluntarily and knowingly bind themselves by the provisions of the Companies Act.	None
The submission that a limited company should be treated as a quasipartnership should, therefore, not be easily accepted.	None
Having regard to the wide powers under Section 402, very rarely would it be necessary to wind up any company in a petition filed under Sections 397 and 398.	None
The present was a petition under Sections 397 and 398.	None
The Division Bench exercised power under Section 402 to appoint Mehra as a Director to protect his interest and guard against mismanagement.	None
It required Dubey to return to the company the sum of Rs. 52.875 which he had wrongly appropriated to himself.	None
It directed the Registrar of Companies to enquire into other allegations of misconduct in which it found, prima facie, substance and we may say immediately that we have perused the report filed by the Registrar of Companies which shows that no substance was, ultimately, found therein.	None
We agree with the Division Bench that this was no case for winding up the company and must dismiss the appeal filed by Mehra.	None
(See also Dabhol Power Co. (supra), para 43)	None
Kilpest Pvt. Ltd. and others vs. Shekhar Mehra (1996) 10 SCC 696 , whereupon Mr. Desai placed strong reliance, thus, cannot be said to be an authority for the proposition that for no purpose whatsoever the principles of quasipartnership can be applied to an incorporated company.	None
The real character of the company, as noticed hereinbefore, for the purpose of judging the dealings between the parties and the transactions which are impugned may assume significance and in such an event, the principles of quasipartnership in a given case may be invoked.	None
The ratio of the said decision, with respect, cannot be held to be correct as a bare proposition of law, as was urged by Mr. Desai, being contrary to a larger Bench judgments of this Court and in particular Needle Industries (supra).	None
It is, however, one thing to say that for the purpose of dealing with an application under Section 397 of the Companies Act, the court would not easily accept the plea of quasipartnership but as has been held in Needle Industries (supra), the true character of the company and other relevant factors shall be considered for the purpose of grant of relief having regard to the concept of quasi partnership.	None
FINDINGS The upshot of our aforementioned discussions is The Appellant No. 1 had no fiduciary duty to inform the Respondent Nos. 1, 12 and 13 herein as regard the benefit or otherwise of opting for allotment of shares.	None
The Respondent No. 1 herein in her company petition having admitted the factum of broadbasing of the company by issuance of 15000 additional equity shares and allotment of 6475 shares in favour of the Appellants herein cannot now be permitted to turn around and raise the correctness or validity thereof.	Reasoning
However, allotment of 3000 shares in favour of the Appellants and 500 shares in favour of the Respondent No. 12 purported to be out of 8000 shares allotted to FRG are bad in law.	Reasoning
The Respondent No. 1 herein had not been able to prove any act of oppression as against the Appellant No. 1.	Reasoning
The claim of the Respondent No. 1 as regards declaration of her title and or allotment of 8000 shares is not tenable in law.	Reasoning
The alleged right of the Respondent No. 1 to claim title over the said shares as a class 1 heir of Fatehsinh Gaekwad cannot be determined in an application filed under Sections 397 and 398 of the Companies Act and in particular having regard to the fact that the said question is pending adjudication in a duly instituted civil suit.	Reasoning
Transfer of 9415 shares by the Appellants in favour of Indreni by itself was not an act of oppression keeping in view of the fact that the entire shares of the said company were held by the Appellants alone and in any event the notice of transfer having been rescinded, the Appellants continue to be the owner in respect thereof.	Issue
CONCLUSION	None
For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgments of the Division Bench cannot be sustained which is set aside accordingly.	Decision
The appeals are allowed in part and to the extent mentioned hereinbefore with the following directions It is hereby declared that the allotment of shares from the additional share capital had been increased pursuant to the resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 17th December, 1987 and the resolution of the Board of Directors dated 8.1.1988 shall be treated as valid and effective except the allotment of 3000 shares in favour of Pratapsinh S. Gaekwad and Priyadarshiniraje S. Gaekwad and 500 shares in favour of Respondent No. 12 herein.	None
The register of the members and others records of the company will stand rectified accordingly.	Facts
The Board of Directors shall consider the question as regard shifting of the office of the Company to Surat from Baroda.	Decision
The records of the company, if any, in possession of any of the members or any other director shall be restored to the Registered Office of the Company failing which it would be open to the company to initiate appropriate proceedings before appropriate forum.	Decision
An Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders of the Company will be convened on 26th February, 2005 at 11.00 a.m. at Baroda for appointment of the directors of the company on the basis of the shares respectively held by them as also the Articles of Association and in accordance with this order of this Court.	Decision
The aforesaid meeting will be conducted under the Chairmanship of a nominee of the Registrar of the Companies.	None
All the shareholders will be entitled to vote by themselves or through their proxies at the said meeting for appointment of the directors of the company.	Decision
The Registrar of the Companies shall for the purpose of holding the said meeting shall issue notices thereof to the shareholders and may get the said notice published in newspapers one in English and one in Gujarat having circulation in the area.	Decision
Costs of publication and issuance of such notice shall be borne by the company.	None
Appellant No.1, however, shall deposit a sum of Rs. 30,000/ before the Registrar of the Companies within two weeks from date for meeting the requisite expenditure thereof.	Decision
The said sum of Rs. 30000/ shall be reimbursed to Appellant No.1 by the company within four weeks from the date of the meeting.	Decision
The Appellant No.1 shall further supply the names and addresses of the shareholders of the company to the Registrar of company within two weeks from date.	Decision
The Registrar of the Companies or his nominee shall be entitled to seek assistance for peaceful conducting of the meeting from such authority or authorities as may be considered necessary.	None
