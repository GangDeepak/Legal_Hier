Nos. 142 143 of 2007 by the contractors seeking a direction from the Court directing that the amounts awarded by the learned Sole Arbitrator be paid from the amount deposited by the railway administration with the High Court along with the accrued interest as on date on the aforesaid amount.	Facts
These applications were allowed by order dated 24th February, 2011.	Facts
The High Court directed that the awarded amount deposited by the railways in the Court for satisfying the outcome of the original petitions which was subsequently converted into fixed deposit receipts, be dispersed to the respondent contractors.7.	Facts
Again the railway administration filed intra court appeals challenging the order of the learned Single Judge principally on the ground that the railway administration was not liable to pay any interest for the period subsequent to the deposit of the principal amount into Court.	Facts
The appeals filed by the railway administration were dismissed by the High Court by the impugned order dated 21st March, 2012.	Facts
The High Court held that railway administration had not questioned the power of the sole arbitrator to award interest.	Facts
The issue with regard to the award of interest was also not raised before the learned Single Judge.	Facts
For the first time before the Division Bench, a plea was raised that the award of interest was contrary to Clause No. 2401 of the Indian Railways Standard Conditions of Contract.	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court came to the conclusion that the aforesaid clause has no application at all as it applies only to amounts, which have been withheld or retained under lien.	Facts
The amounts having already been paid were sought to be illegally recovered from the contractors.	Facts
The sole arbitrator found that such order of recovery can not be sustained in law and the recoveries affected were illegal.	Facts
The High Court, however, concluded that Clause No. 2401 would have application only in respect of amounts which had not been paid to the contractors.	Facts
The railway administration can not exercise lien over the amounts already paid to the contractors.	Facts
Therefore, award of the arbitrator did not suffer from any error apparent.	Facts
It was further held that the learned Single Judge having upheld the award, the appeals deserve to be dismissed.8.	Facts
The appeals having been dismissed, the Union of India has approached this Court in these Civil Appeals.	None
We have heard Mr. Mohan Jain, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing for the appellants.	None
It is submitted that the only question which arises for consideration of this Court is whether the contractors are entitled to interest for the amount withheld and if so at what rate.	Arguments of Petitioner
The contractors had claimed interest 18 per cent from the date of recovery till payment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Jain submitted that the High Court has wrongly held that the appellant had no authority to exercise lien on the current payments in relation to the amount already released to the contractors.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted by Mr. Jain that the arbitrator had no authority to award interest in view of the prohibition contained under Section 31(7) of the Arbitration Act, 1996.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Additional Solicitor General pointed out that the contract entered into between the parties did not provide for any payment of interest.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Jain also pointed out that under Clause 2403, the railway administration has a lien on all the amounts of money that may be due to the contractors, in praesenti or in the futuro.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, when the contractors were paid in excess of the amounts actually due, the appellants were fully justified in recovering the amount from the respondents by exercising the lien over the future bills in terms of Clause No. 2403.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submits that the sole arbitrator was wholly unjustified in awarding interest, as under Clause No. 2403(b), it is specifically provided that the contractors shall have no claim for interest or damages whatsoever, for the amount so retained even in case the arbitration award or any other legal proceeding subsequently holds that the amount was withheld illegally.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Jain submits that the learned Single Judge erred in holding that the award did not suffer from an error apparent on this short ground.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of the submission, he relies on judgment of this Court in the case of Himachal Pradesh Housing and Urban Development Authority Anr.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ranjit Singh Rana.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2012) 4 SCC 505 11.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Jain further submitted that the principal amount awarded was deposited in Court in 2007.	Arguments of Petitioner
This amount was released to the contractors on 24th April, 2011 alongwith the interest, but 30 per cent of the amount was duly withheld.	Arguments of Petitioner
This was in agreement with the respondents.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also pointed out that in fact the recovery of the amount was deferred after discussions with the respondents.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of the agreements, the respondents had no justification for claiming any interest and the award granting such relief suffer from an error apparent as it was contrary to the contract.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of this submission, he relies on judgment of this Court in Sree Kamatchi Amman Construction Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Divisional Railway Manager (Works), Palghat Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2010) 8 SCC 767	Arguments of Petitioner

Mr. C.S. Vaidyanathan, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that the payments have been made to the contractors from 1989 till November, 1994.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court judgment in the writ petitions challenging the recovery notice were set aside by the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents had agreed to the deduction of 30 per cent only because the contractors required the money for execution of further works.	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that the appellants can not possibly be permitted to claim that the respondents had agreed to the deduction of 30 per cent of the amount due.	Arguments of Respondent
He pointed out that the recovery was made against the supplies made under the agreements of 9th December, 1991 in relation to the contracts which were being performed in the year 1996.	Arguments of Respondent
In such circumstances, the appellants had no authority to exercise lien on the amounts that accrued due to the works performed subsequent to 9th December, 1991 under Clause(s) 2401 or 2403 of the Contract.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Vaidyanathan emphasized that such recovery of the time barred claims is clearly without any justification.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellants having failed to notify that 30 per cent of the amount due had been withheld, the invocation of Clause No. 2401 or 2403 would be wholly illegal.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned senior counsel further submitted that the appellant can not justify the recovery on the basis of the letter dated 22nd October, 1997 as it was written without prejudice to the rights of the contractors.	Arguments of Respondent
The counter claims made by the appellant were clearly time barred and hence, disallowed by the sole arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Vaidyanathan relied on a Constitution Bench decision of this Court in Executive Engineer, Dhenkanal Minor Irrigation Division, Orissa Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
Vs. N.C.	Arguments of Respondent
Budharaj (Deceased) by LRs.	Arguments of Respondent

(2001) 2 SCC 721 Reliance was also placed upon Secretary, Irrigation Department, Government of Orissa Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
Vs. G.C. Roy (1992) 1 SCC 508 in support of the submission that a person deprived of his money is entitled to be compensated by way of interest, therefore, any provision in the contract which seeks to take away such a right has to be strictly construed.	Arguments of Respondent
The ratio in the aforesaid judgment has been subsequently reiterated, according to Mr. Vaidyanathan, in the case of Sree Kamatchi Amman Construction (supra).	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Vaidyanathan submitted that the railway administration had no authority either under Clause 2401 or 2403 of the contract to recover the amounts allegedly overpaid for the work done prior to 1991 from the amounts due to the contractors for the works done subsequently.13.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties.	None
Clause Nos. 2401 and 2403 are as under 2401.	None
Whenever any claim or claims for payment of a sum of money arises out of or under the contract against the Contractor, the Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold and also have a lien to retain such sum or sums in whole or in part from the security, if any, deposited by the Contractor and for the purpose aforesaid, the Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold the said cash security deposit or the security, if any, furnished as the case may be and also have a lien over the same pending finalization or adjudication of any such claim.	None
In the event of the security being insufficient to cover the claimed amount or amounts or if no security has been taken from the Contractor, the Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold and have lien to retain to the extent of the such claimed amount or amounts referred to supra, from any sum or sums found payable or which at any timethereafter may become payable to the Contractor under the same contract or any other contract with the Purchaser or the Government pending finalization or adjudication of any such claim.	None
It is an agreed term of the contract that the sum of money or moneys so withheld or retained under the lien referred to above, by the Purchaser will be kept withheld or retained as such by the Purchaser till the claim arising out of or under the contract is determined by the Arbitrator (if the contract is governed by the arbitration clause) or by the competent court as prescribed under Clause 2703 hereinafter provided, as the case may be, and that the Contractor will have no claim for interest or damages whatsoever on any account in respect of such withholding or retention under the lien referred to supra and duly notified as such to the contractor.	None
2403.	None
Lien in respect of Claims in other Contractsa) Any sum of money due and payable, to the Contractor (including the security deposit, returnable to him) under the contract may withhold or retain by way of lien by the Purchaser or Government against any claim of the Purchaser or Government in respect of payment of a sum of money arising out of or under any other contract made by the Contractor with the Purchaser or Government.b)	None
It is an agreed term of the contract that the sum of money so withheld or retained under this clause by the Purchaser or Government will be kept withheld or retained as such by the Purchaser or Government till his claim arising out of the same contract or any other contract is either mutually settled or determined by the arbitrator, if the contract is governed by the arbitration clause or by the competent court under Clause 2703 hereinafter provided, as the case may be, and that the Contractor shall have no claim for interest or damages whatsoever on this account or on any other ground in respect of any sum of money withheld or retained under this clause and duly notified as such to the Contractor.	None
Clause 2401 provides that the railways shall be entitled to withhold and also have a lien to retain any amount deposited as security by the contractor to satisfy any claims arising out of or in the contract.	None
In such circumstances, the railways can withhold the amount deposited by the contractors as security and also have lien over the same pending finalization or adjudication of the claim.	None
In case, the security deposit is insufficient to cover the claim of the railways, it is entitled to withhold and have lien to the extent of the amount claimed from any sum payable for any works done by the contractor thereafter under the same contract or any other contract.	None
This withholding of the money and the exercise of the lien is pending finalization or adjudication of any claim.	None
This clause further provided that the amount withheld by the railways over which it is exercising lien will not entitle the contractor to claim any interest or damages for such withholding or retention under lien by the railways.	None
Clause 2403 again provides that any sum of money due and payable to the contractor under the contract may be withheld or retained by way of lien by the railway authorities or the Government in respect of payment of a sum of money arising out of or under any other contract made by the contractor with the railway authority or the Government.	None
Clause 2403(b) further provides that it is an agreed term of the contract that against the sum of money withheld or retained under lien, the contractor shall have no claim for interest or damages whatsoever provided the claim has been duly notified to the contractor.	None
We are of the opinion that the sole arbitrator in awarding interest to the contractors has failed to take into account the provisions contained in the aforesaid two clauses.	Reasoning
We find merit in the submission made by learned Additional Solicitor General that award of interest atleast from the date when the amount was deposited in Court was wholly unwarranted.	Reasoning
Therefore, the High Court as well as the arbitrator, in our opinion, have committed an error of jurisdiction in this respect.	None
This view of ours will find support from the judgment of this Court in the case of Sayeed Ahmed Company (supra), wherein it has been held as follows In view of clause (a) of subsection (7) of Section 31 of the Act, it is clear that the arbitrator could not have awarded interest up to the date of the award, as the agreement between the parties barred payment of interest.	None
The bar against award of interest would operate not only during the prereference period, that is, up to 1331997 but also during the pendente lite period, that is, from 1431997 to 3172001.	None
This view has been reiterated by this Court in Sree Kamatchi Amman Construction (supra), wherein it has been held as follows Section 37(1) of the new Act by using the words unless otherwise agreed by the parties categorically clarifies that the arbitrator is bound by the terms of the contract insofar as the award of interest from the date of cause of action to the date of award.	None
Therefore, where the parties had agreed that no interest shall be payable, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest between the date when the cause of action arose to the date of award.	None
From the aforesaid it becomes apparent that the arbitrator could not have awarded any interest from the date when the recovery was made till the award was made.	None
However, interest would have been payable from the date when the award was made till the money was deposited in the High Court and thereafter converted to fixed deposit receipts.	Reasoning
Upon the amount being deposited in the High Court, no further interest could be paid to the respondents.21.	Reasoning
In view of the aforesaid, the appeals are allowed and it is directed that the respondents shall not be entitled to any interest on the amount which was recovered by the appellant, till the date of award and thereafter till the date when the amount awarded was deposited in the High Court, i.e. from 12th July, 1997.22.	Decision
The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms.	Decision
