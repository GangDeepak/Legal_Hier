Facts
The respondents in their writ petitions raised three fold contentions, firstly, it was urged on their behalf that by exporting processed iron ore during the period 1.4.1989 to 31.3.1990 under the import export policy for the years 19981991 (old Policy), the had acquired a vested right to get additional licence in the licensing year	Arguments of Respondent
AprilMarch 19901991 of the value prescribed in the import export policy relevant for April 1988 March 1991 and the said right could not be defeated by the provisions of the new policy.	Arguments of Respondent
Secondly, it was contended that on a true construction of the relevant provisions of the import export policy for April 1990  March 1993, in particular, paragraph 220 thereof, the respondents were entitled to additional licence for the licensing year April 1990March 1991 against exports of possessed iron one made in the preceding licensing year i.e., April 1989 March 1990 and that the authorities have misconstrued the relevant provisions.	Arguments of Respondent
Thirdly, it was contended that the Union of India was precluded by the doctrine or Promissory Estoppel for denying the additional licence to the company during the licensing year AprilMarch 1991 of the value defined having represented to the Trading Houses Exporters that they would be entitled to the additional licence, the parties having acted upon that representation and having exported processed iron ore during the period 1.4.1989 to 31.3.1990.8.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellants apart from raising certain preliminary objections regarding the maintainability of the writ petitions which were rejected by the High Court and which have not been pressed before us did not dispute the factual statements of facts made in paragraphs 1 to 8 in the writ petitions stating that these were matters of records.	Arguments of Petitioner
in so far as the claim of the respondents for 20 premium it was contended that there was no application from the party pending for entitlement of additional licence as their application for additional licence was rejected.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was denied that their action in rejecting the application of the respondents for the grant of additional licence was contrary to law or null and void or in excess of jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
That the claim for additional licence in subsequent year was ineligible under the new policy although that might have been available under the old policy, which, however, ceased to exist after 31st March, 1990.	Arguments of Petitioner
Claim of respondents writ petitioners that they had acquired any vested right to get an additional licence by virtue of exports made during the year 19891990 was denied.	Arguments of Petitioner
That the amendment made in the policy was valid and the consequences flowing thereof were in the public interest and therefore, not opened to challenge.	Arguments of Petitioner
Circumstances which necessitated the amendment in public interest were set out.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the appellants the export incentive was subject to changes from time to time during the policy period.	Arguments of Petitioner
A change when it was brought in the policy after 30th March 1990 could thus be made and was binding upon the parties and that the said amendment was made in public interest particularly taking into account that spite of other existing financial burden on the exchequer, incentive on iron ore was further amounting to large amount of outflow of foreign exchange by way of additional licence and higher REP benefits.	Arguments of Petitioner
For these reasons, according to the appellants, there did not arise any question of any promise having been made by the government to the Trading Houses Exporters and, therefore, the principal or Promissory Estoppel could not be invoked and the same was not applicable to the facts of the case.	Arguments of Petitioner
It maintained that the application for additional licence made by the respondents was rejected in accordance with the position of law as it obtained on that date.9.	Arguments of Petitioner
It may be highlighted that appellants did not dispute that the respondents company was a recognised Trading House.	None
The extent of export of processed iron ore made by the respondents between 1.4.1989 to 31.3.1990 and the value thereof stated in the writ petition were not controverted.	None
The value shown by the respondent for the purpose of additional licence was also not disputed.	None
No issue as regards the net foreign exchange earnings as may have been earned against the export of iron ore was raised.	None
Except from contending that the respondents were ineligible for grant of additional licence as per the new policy it was not stated that the application for licence was liable to be rejected on any other ground.	None
Issuance of the Circular 11 of 93 for payment of premium in the manner provided instead of additional licence to which the applicant may have been entitled to was also not disputed.	None
The High Court by the impugned order independent of and relying upon an earlier division bench judgment of its own court held that the writ petitioners were entitled to the grant of additional licence and accordingly quashed the orders passed by the authorities rejecting their claim for the additional licence.	None
Because of the coming into force of the Circular 11 of 93 instead of directing the authorities to grant the additional licence it was declared that the respondents would be entitled to the payment of premium of 20 in terms of the relevant clause of which extracted in paragraph no.4 of this judgment.	None
The short point to be decided in these appeals is as to whether the respondents who were admittedly entitled to grant of additional licence under the old policy stand debarred from claiming the said additional licence because of the new import export policy which came into force from 1st April, 1990 and further the applicability of the Circular 11 of 93 dated 5th May, 1993 and the effect thereof.	Issue
Before addressing on the controversy, the salient features of the old import export effective for April 1988March 1991, which was terminated on 30th March, 1990 and was replaced by the new import export policy April 1990March, 1973, may be set out.	None
Paragraph 211 of the old policy sets out the objectives of the scheme for registration of export houses and trading houses.	None
It states that it is to grant recognition and facilities to a select band of efficient registered exporters who would develop a strong marketing capability and that it is expected that they would operate a highly specialized and dynamic institutions with a strong marketing infrastructure and act as an important instrument for export growth.	None
Paragraph 212 provides that the eligibility for grant of Trading Houses Export Houses certificate shall be determined on the basis of the net foreign exchange earnings from the exports actually made during the past period subject to the conditions set out in subparagraph (2) of the said paragraph.	None
Paragraph 315 provides for additional licence.	None
Thereunder the Trading Houses Export Houses will be eligible to additional licence on the basis of the admissible exports made in the proceeding licensing year and that the value of this licence will be calculated at 10 of the net foreign exchange (NFE) earnings on the total eligible exports made in the preceding licensing year.	None
Remaining part of the paragraph is not material and therefore is not being set out.	None
Subparagraph (2) laid down that the additional licence shall be valid for the export of the items listed thereunder.	None
Subparagraph (8) provides that the items permissible shall be those eligible under the policy on the date of issue of the licence.	None
Paragraph 218, inter alia, provides that where the applications for additional licence have not been disposed of by 31st March of the preceding licensing year, the rate of entitlement will be the same as permissible during the licensing year to which the applications pertained but the items to be allowed will be as per the import policy on the date of the licence.	None
Appendix 12 of the old policy does not list iron ore as ineligible product for import replenishment licence or additional licence.	None
Paragraph 204 of Chapter XV of the new policy provides that in the case of exports made prior to 1.4.1990 against which REP licence was issued on or after 1.4.1990, the rate of import replenishment will be as admissible on the date of export but subject to the conditions laid down in 19981991 policy book.	None
Chapter XVI deals with deemed exports.	None
Under paragraph 210 the deemed exports will qualify for grant of import replenishment licence.	None
The material provision, however, is contained in Chapter XVIII.	None
PartA thereof deals with Export Houses Trading Houses.	None
The objective is similar to that of earlier policy.	None
The eligibility criteria laid down in paragraph 218 for the grant of export trading housing certificate is to be determined on the basis of NFE earnings from the exports actually made in the preceding three licensing years termed as base period.	None
The earnings from export of products in Appendix 12 shall not quality for this purpose.	None
Paragraph 220 deals with additional licence and provides, inter alia, that the export houses trading houses will be eligible for additional licences on the basis of admissible exports made in the preceding licensing year and the value of the licence will be calculated at the rate of 10 NFE earnings on the total eligible exports made in the preceding licensing year.	None
Paragraph 222 deals with transitional arrangements and the same reads as under Where the applications from Export Houses Trading Houses for Additional Licence for any of the preceding licensing year, have not been disposed of by the end of the licensing year, licenses will be issued as per the relevant Policy provisions prevailing during the period to which the Additional Licenses relate, subject to the condition that the permissibility of the items allowed for import against such licences will be governed by the relevant provision of the Import Policy in force, at the time of their actual import.	None
Coming to the point raised it is to be noticed that paragraph 215 of the old policy is clear and provides that eligibility to the additional licence was to be determined on the basis of the admissible exports made in the preceding licensing year.	None
Paragraph 222 of the new policy which has been extracted above provides that where the applications from export houses trading houses for additional licences for any of the preceding year, have not been disposed of by the end of the licensing year, licences will be issued as per the relevant policy provisions prevailing during the period to which the additional licences relate.	None
Meaning thereby that if an application for additional licence for any preceding licensing year is pending which in this case shall be deemed to be pending as the controversy is still alive being adjudicated then the licence has to be issued as per the relevant policy provisions prevailing during the period to which the additional licence relates which in the present case would be under the old policy.	None
The grant of additional licence in paragraph 222 has been made subject to the condition that the permissibility of the items allowed for import against such licences will be governed by the relevant provisions of the import in force at the time of their actual import meaning thereby that the items which can be imported would be relatable to the import policy in force, i.e., the new policy.	None
Traditional arrangements stated in paragraph 222 makes it abundantly clear that the applications from export houses tradition houses which have not been finally disposed of by the end of the licensing year would be entitled to the issuance of the additional licence as per the relevant policy provisions prevailing during the period to which the additional licence related.	None
The entitlement of the export houses trading houses to get the additional licence has not been taken away.	None
The only condition to which the additional licence has been subjected is that the permissible items allowable for import against such (additional licensing) would be governed by the provisions of the import policy in force at the time of their actual import.	None
Contentions raised on behalf of the Union of India that the respondents writ petitioners had to lodge their right entitlement to get the additional licence under the new policy for the exports made during the period when the old policy was in force cannot be accepted.	None
The application for the additional licence could be made only after the end of the fiscal year, as only thereafter the export house could know its entitlement.	Reasoning
The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the interpretation put by the authorities on the new policy in declining the claim of the respondents for the grant of additional licence was unacceptable.	Reasoning
Under the new policy as well, the export houses trading houses would remain entitled to the additional licence for the exports made during the period when the old policy was in force but subject to the condition that they would be allowed to import against the additional licence such items which are governed by the policy in force at the time of the import of the goods.	Reasoning
For the reasons stated above, we do not find any infirmity in the orders passed by the High Court in quashing the orders passed by the authorities rejecting the claim of the respondents for grant of additional licence.	None
Similarly, we do not find any infirmity in the orders passed by the High Court in the issuance of writ of mandamus directing the Union of India to forthwith pay to the respondents the premium of 20 instead of issuing the additional licence in terms of the Circular 11 of 93.	None
Circular 11 of 93 provides that where application for grant of additional licence are pending in respect of the exports made and export proceeds relating to the period prior to 1.3.1992 then instead of issuing the licences, the 20 premium shall be paid.	Reasoning
The order passed by the High Court is strictly in conformity with the Circular 11 of 93 issued by the appellants itself.	Reasoning
Bank guarantee given by the respondents in pursuance to the Order of this Court dated 28.3.1994 shall stand discharged.	Decision
The appeals being without any merit are, therefore, dismissed.	Decision
Parties shall bear their own costs in these appeals.	Decision
