Shri K.V. Viswanathan, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants have raised various submissions in support of the appeals.	Arguments of Petitioner
The foremost submission raised by Shri K.V. Viswanathan is that Dr. S.B. Sinha, who was allegedly the brain behind conspiracy having died on 25.10.1999, which fact having brought to the notice of the Judicial Commissioner, there was no reason to continue the attachment and to make the attachment order absolute on 03.05.2001.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that due to death of Dr. S.B. Sinha, criminal proceedings against him has abated.	Arguments of Petitioner
Dr. S.B. Sinha no longer could have been convicted due to abatement of proceedings and the order of attachment ought to have been withdrawn.13.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel has relied on judgment of this Court in U. Subhadramma Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 2016(3) R.C.R.(Criminal)	Arguments of Petitioner
548 2016(2)	Arguments of Petitioner
Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 206 (2016) 7 SCC 797.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submits that due to death of an accused neither any guilt can be pronounced nor any conviction can be ordered and the order of attachment of properties ought to have been withdrawn and the Judicial Commissioner committed error in making the order absolute.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that appellants were alleged to be only name lenders and except Ravi Sinha, other three appellants are not involved in fodder scam case.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any case, the attachment could have been with regard to the properties of Dr. S.B. Sinha and the properties of the present appellants were not liable to be attached.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ravi Sinha has been accused in four cases out of which in one case, he has been acquitted and in another case, he was not sent up for trial.	Arguments of Petitioner
In one case, i.e. RC No. 39/1996, appeal has already been filed in the High Court and the case i.e. R.C.	Arguments of Petitioner
No. 68/1996 is pending in the trial court.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further submits that amount alleged to be misappropriated in R.C.	Arguments of Petitioner
No.	Arguments of Petitioner
39/1996 and R.C.	Arguments of Petitioner
No. 68/1996 stands secured as the same was deposited before the trial court pursuant to orders of the Honble High Court granting him bail.14.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been further contended that C.B.I. had not sought orders under Section 12 of the 1944 Ordinance at the stage of conviction in R.C. No. 39/1996, it cannot now do so.	Arguments of Petitioner
The stage of Section 12 having come and gone, no orders can be passed with regard to properties attached.	None
Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General refuting the submission of learned senior counsel for the appellants contends that the order of attachment as well as order making the attachment absolute are in accordance with law.	Arguments of Respondent
He submits that in a fodder scam, which relates to nonsupply of medicines and in which money more than Rs. 600 crores has been defrauded, the accused are part of a larger conspiracy.	Arguments of Respondent
Ravi Sinha has already been convicted by judgment and order dated 12.06.2008 in R.C.	Arguments of Respondent
No. 39(A) of 1996 (Spl.	Arguments of Respondent
No. 41 of 1996), it has been proved that he has committed offence.	Arguments of Respondent
Sentence of Rigorous Imprisonment for various offences including fine has been awarded against him.	Arguments of Respondent
The properties at this state where a larger conspiracy was hatched and large number of accused having been convicted and or are still facing trial, the attachment of the properties could not have been withdrawn.	Arguments of Respondent
Even though Dr. S.B. Sinha had died in the year 1999, the properties attached could not have been released.	Arguments of Respondent
One of his legal heirs was also facing criminal proceedings in the same larger conspiracy to misappropriate the Government fund.16.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri K.K. Venugopal further submits that the mere fact that allegations against Shri Ravi Sinha in the charge sheet, which was filed against him were of specific amount cannot be said to mean that once the aforesaid amount is mentioned, the properties already attached should be withdrawn since properties were acquired under larger conspiracy and the smaller conspiracy was part of a larger conspiracy.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Venugupal has also referred to judgment of this Court in State of Jharkhand v. Laloo Prasad Yadav, 2017(2) R.C.R.(Criminal) 901 2017(3)	Arguments of Respondent
Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 247 (2017) 8 SCC 1.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri K.K. Venugopal answering the submissions with regard to Sections 12 and 13 of Ordinance contends that proceedings under Sections 12 and 13 are independent proceedings and merely because at the time of conviction order passed against Ravi Sinha, no mention was made of properties, which were attached shall not come in the way in passing an order under Section 13 of the Ordinance, 1944.	Arguments of Respondent
After completion of the criminal proceedings, order can be passed under Section 13.	None
Submissions in Criminal Appeal Nos. 15421543 of 2008 and 15581559 of 2008 Learned counsel appearing for the appellant in aforesaid criminal appeals contends that the above appeals involved totally different issues from the Ravi Sinhas case.	None
The trial court and the High Court have not considered the various materials like Income Tax Returns, Wealth Tax Returns, Electricity Receipts, House Tax Receipts, Bank Drafts etc., which clearly established the independent status sources of income of the Appellants.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court has merely confirmed the order of trial court without consideration of the material.	Arguments of Petitioner
There was no justification for attachment of property at Sl.	Arguments of Petitioner
No.3 i.e. Kashmere Gate property since the said property was acquired in the year 1955 in the name of Sandeep Malik.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Property No. 158, Gali Bagichewali, Kashmere Gate, Delhi was purchased in the year 1955 in the public auction.	Arguments of Petitioner
The property of Engineers Enclave, New Delhi in which Sandeep Malik is a coowner was purchased in the year 1991 i.e. much before the alleged scam.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel appearing for the State of Jharkhand has refuted the above submission and submitted that application which was filed by the State clearly alleged that properties were purchased out of illgotten money by Vijay Kumar Mallick in his name and in names of his relatives.	None
It is further stated that the value of properties was only about Rs. 25 lakhs whereas the defalcation alleged was more than a crore, hence attachment of other properties of accused are also permissible under the provisions of Ordinance, 1944.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the records.	Reasoning
We first proceed to the submissions raised by Mr. K.V. Viswanathan.	None
The principal submission of Shri K.V. Viswanathan is that after death of Dr. S.B. Sinha on 25.10.1999, the attachment of properties ought to have been withdrawn since after the death of the accused neither any order of conviction can be passed nor even guilt can be pronounced.	None
He has placed reliance on judgment of this Court in U. Subhadramma Ors.	None
v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (supra).	None
This Court in the said case was considering the provisions of Ordinance, 1944.	None
The properties were attached after the death of accused and further conviction was pronounced several years after his death.	None
This Court held that no application for attachment could have been made after the death of the accused and the conviction pronounced after death of the accused was null and void.	None
In Paragraph 12 of the judgment, following has been held In fact, we find that the learned District Judge could not have proceeded with the attachment proceedings at all since the attachment proceedings were initiated by the State against Ramachandraiah under Section 3 of the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944, who was actually dead.	None
Section 3 contemplates that such an application must be made to the District Judge within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the said person ordinarily resides or carries on business, in respect of property which the State Government believes the said person to have procured by means of the offences.	None
It is incomprehensible, therefore, that such an application could have been made in regard to a dead person who obviously cannot be said to be ordinarily resident or carrying on business anywhere.	None
There is no legal provision which enables continuance of prosecution upon death of the accused.	None
We must record that the proceedings and the decisions of the courts below are disturbing, to say the least.	None
In the first place, though the accused had died, the trial court proceeded with the trial and recorded a conviction two years after his death.	None
Then, this null and void conviction was used as a basis for making an attachment of his properties before the Sessions Court.	None
Astonishingly, all applications succeeded, the attachment was made absolute and over and above all, the High Court upheld the attachment.	None
There cannot be any dispute to the proposition that no proceedings under Ordinance, 1944 can be undertaken against the accused after his death and the prosecution cannot continue after the death of an accused.	Reasoning
There cannot be any dispute that after death of Dr. S.B. Sinha, no prosecution could have been continued against him, in fact after noticing his death, the charge sheet was not submitted by C.B.I. against Dr. S.B. Sinha.22.	Reasoning
In the present case, there is one fact, which makes the present case different from the case of U. Subhadramma Ors.	Reasoning
v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (supra), i.e. in the present case, Ravi Sinha, the son of Dr. S.B. Sinha was himself accused in large number of cases.	Reasoning
In one case, he had already been convicted and fined.	Reasoning
In another case relating to the similar fodder scam, i.e., R.C. No. 36/1996, the trial is going on.	Reasoning
There is a specific allegation that he had received payment but did not supply medicine worth Rs. 9.75 lakhs in R.C. Case No. 39/1996, in which he has been convicted.	Reasoning
Allegation was against him that the company was paid a sum of Rs. 5.90 lakhs and there was nonsupply of medicine.	Reasoning
The appellant himself in his appeal No. 1561 of 2008 has filed a rejoinder affidavit and in Paragraph 16, following has been stated That what emerges from the aforesaid facts is that out of four cases against him Ravi Sinha has been acquitted in one and not sent up for trial in another.	None
Even in the other two, in one the trial is underway and in the other he has been convicted but his appeal is pending before the Honble High Court.	None
While nothing needs to be said about the first two cases, even with respect to the latter two cases, the amount allegedly misappropriated by Ravi Sinha, assuming whilst denying that ultimately the charges are found true, stands secured as he has already deposited the amount with the trial court.	None
Therefore there can be absolutely no rationale for initiating separate attachment proceedings against him as the very object of the attachment proceedings, under the Ordinance is to secure the amount allegedly misappropriated so that in case of conviction, the attached assets could be forfeited and liquidated to make good the amount misappropriated.	None
Being conscious of this legal position, the CBI has not initiated and cannot initiate any attachment proceedings against Ravi Sinha but is rising this issue of cases against Ravi Sinha just to prejudice this Honble Court.	None
True copy of a chart dated Nil giving the status of the cases against Ravi Sinha is appended hereto marked ANNEXURE R/11	None
It is thus an admitted position that Ravi Sinha had been convicted in the fodder scam case and in one case trial is already going on.	None
There being an order of conviction of Ravi Sinha and in other case trial being underway making attachment order absolute cannot be faulted with.	Reasoning
It is true that prosecution against Dr. S.B. Sinha could not have been continued after his death and no guilt can be pronounced of Dr. S.B. Sinha, he being dead.	Reasoning
However, the properties which were already under attachment, having come in the hands of accused Ravi Sinha as one of the legal representatives, who has been convicted in a fodder scam case and is facing trial in another case, present is not a case where this Court can exercise its jurisdiction under Article 136 to interfere with the order of the High Court and of the Judicial Commissioner in making the order of attachment absolute.	Reasoning
We thus do not find the present case fit to exercise our jurisdiction under Article 136 on the above submission of learned counsel for the appellants.	Reasoning
The submission raised by Mr. Viswanathan in regard to Sections 12 and 13 of the Ordinance needs now to be considered.	None
Sections 12 and 13 of the Ordinance are as under Criminal Courts to evaluate property procured by scheduled offences.(1) Where before judgment is pronounced in any criminal trial for a scheduled offence it is represented to the Court that an order of attachment of property has been passed under this Ordinance in connection with such offence, the Court shall, if it is Convicting the accused, record a finding as to the amount of money or value of other property procured by the accused by means of the offence.(2)	None
In any appeal or revisional proceedings against such conviction, the appellate or revisional Court shall unless it sets aside the conviction, either confirm such finding or modify it in such manner as it thinks proper.(3)	None
In any appeal or revisional proceedings against an order of acquittal passed in a trial such as is referred to in subsection (1), the appellate or revisional Court, if it convicts the accused, shall record a finding such as is referred to in that subsection.(4) Where the accused is convicted of a scheduled offence other than one specified in item I of the Schedule to this Ordinance and where it appears that the offence has caused loss to more than one Government referred to in the said schedule or local authority the finding referred to in this section shall indicate the amount of loss sustained by each such Government or local authority.(5) Where the accused is convicted at the same trial of one or more offences specified in item I of the Schedule to this Ordinance and of one or more offences specified in any of the other items of the said Schedule, the finding referred to in this section shall indicate separately the amounts procured by means of the two classes of offences.13.Disposal of attached property upon termination of criminal proceedings.(1) Upon the termination of any criminal proceedings for any scheduled offence in respect of which any order of attachment of property has been made under this Ordinance or security given in lieu thereof, the agent of the State Government or, as the case may be, the Central Government shall, without delay inform the District Judge, and shall where criminal proceedings have been taken in any Court, furnish the District Judge with a copy of the judgment or order of the trying Court and with copies of the judgments or orders, if any, of the appellate or revisional Courts thereon.(2) Where it is reported to the District Judge under subsection (1) that cognizance of the alleged scheduled offence has not been taken or where the final judgment or order of the Criminal Court is one of acquittal, the District Judge shall forthwith withdraw any orders of attachment of property made in connection with the offence, or where security has been given in lieu of such attachment, order such security to be returned.(3) Where the final judgment or order of the Criminal Courts is one of conviction, the District Judge shall order that from the property of the convicted person attached under this Ordinance or out of the security given in lieu of such attachment, there shall be forfeited to Government such amount or value as is found in the final judgment or order of the Criminal Courts in pursuance of Section 12 to have been procured by the convicted person by means of the offence, together with the costs of attachment as determined by the District Judge and where the final judgment or order of the Criminal Courts has imposed or upheld a sentence of fine on the said person (whether alone or in conjunction with any other punishment), the District Judge may order, without prejudice to any other mode of recovery, that the said fine shall be recovered from the residue of the said attached property or of the security given in lieu of attachment.(4) Where the amounts ordered to be forfeited or recovered under subsection (3) exceed the value of the property of the convicted person attached, and where the property of any transferee of the convicted person has been attached under Section 6, the District Judge shall order that the balance of the amount ordered to be forfeited under subsection (3) together with the costs of attachment of the transferees property as determined by the District Judge shall be forfeited to Government from the attached property of the transferee or out of the security given in lieu of such attachment and the District Judge may order, without prejudice to any other mode of recovery that any fine referred to in subsection (3) or any portion thereof not recovered under that subsection shall be recovered from the attached property of the transferee or out of security given in lieu of such attachment.(5)	None
If any property remains under attachment in respect of any scheduled offence of any security given in lieu of such attachment remains with the District Judge after his orders under subsection (3) and (4) have been carried into effect, the order of attachment in respect of such property remaining shall be forthwith withdrawn or as the case may be, the remainder of the security returned, under the orders of the District Judge.(6)	None
Every sum ordered to be forfeited under this section in connection with any scheduled offence other than one specified in item I of the Schedule to this Ordinance shall, after deduction of the costs of attachment as determined by the District Judge, be credited to the Government being a Government referred to in the said Schedule or local authority to which the offence has caused loss, or where there is more than one such Government or local authority, the sum shall, after such deduction as aforesaid, be distributed among them in proportion to the loss sustained by each.	None
A perusal of Section 12(1) indicates that when the Court in any criminal trial is represented that an order of attachment of property has already been passed, the Court shall, if it is convicting the accused, record a finding as to the amount of money or value of other property procured by the accused by means of the offence.	Reasoning
Thus, Section 12(1) is to be invoked before the judgment is pronounced and the Court is obliged to record a finding when it is represented to the Court that an order of attachment of property has been passed.	Reasoning
Learned Attorney General has placed before us a copy of the judgment dated 12.06.2008 of trial court in R.C.	None
No. 39(A) of 1996 convicting Ravi Sinha.	None
A perusal of which does not indicate that Court was represented by C.B.I. that any property has already been attached.	None
Thus, the present is not a case where any order was to be passed by the Court under Section 12(1).	Reasoning
In the submission, it has been pressed by Mr. Viswanathan that once stage under Section 12(1) has passed, on it cannot be done later.	Reasoning
According to him, now no order can be passed with regard to attached properties, hence there is no justification for continuation of attachment.	Reasoning
Whether any order can still be passed with regard to attached property is a question to be answered.	None
Section 13 of the Ordinance, 1944 as stated above provides for disposal of attached property upon termination of criminal proceedings.	None
Termination of criminal proceedings are defined in Section 2(2) of the Ordinance, 1944, which provides as follows 2(2).For the purpose of this Ordinance, the date of the termination of criminal proceeding shall be deemed to be(a)where such proceeding are taken to the Supreme Court in appeal, whether on the certificate of a High Court or otherwise, the date on which the Supreme Court passes its final order in such appeal or(b) where such proceedings are taken to the High Court and orders are passed thereon and(i)	None
no application for a certificate for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is made to the High Court, the day immediately following the expiry of ninety days from the date on which the High Court passes its final orders(ii) an application for a certificate for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by the High Court, the day immediately following the expiry of sixty days from the date of the refusal of the certificate(iii) a certificate for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been granted by the High Court, but no appeal is lodged in the Supreme Court, the day immediately following the expiry of thirty days from the date of the order granting the certificate or(c) where such proceedings are not taken to the High Court, the day immediately following the expiry of sixty days from the date of the last judgment or order of a Criminal Court in the Proceedings.	None
In the present case against the order of conviction dated 12.06.2008, appeal is already pending in the High Court as has been pleaded by the appellant.	Reasoning
Thus, criminal proceedings have not yet been terminated.	Reasoning
Further, in one criminal case, trial is already pending against the accused in which provisions of Sections 12 and 13 can still be resorted to.	Reasoning
Thus, this submission cannot be accepted that once a judgment is pronounced in a criminal case by the Court and if no findings have been recorded with regard to attached properties, no order can be passed with regard to attached properties.	Reasoning
Section 13 gives ample power to deal with attached properties after termination of criminal proceedings.	Reasoning
Mr. Viswanathan has also submitted that even accepting the allegations against Ravi Sinha, the allegations centre around only to Rs. 9.75 lakhs and Rs. 2.95 lakhs in R.C. No. 39/1996.	Reasoning
He submits that there can be no justification for keeping the properties under attachment when the allegations are only upto the amount given above and further in the order granting bail, the appellant has already secured the aforesaid amount.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have already noticed that one more trial is still pending against Ravi Sinha.	Reasoning
It is not necessary for us to consider the extent of amount which has been found to be misappropriated by Ravi Sinha and computing the value of properties attached.	Reasoning
These are the questions which can very well be raised by the appellant Ravi Sinha in Section 13 proceedings or at the time of judgment in pending trial by invoking Section 12 of the Ordinance, 1944.	None
We are since confined to the only question in the present case i.e. whether the attachment order ought not to have been made absolute, and thus need not go into this submission in detail or express any opinion?	None

After consideration of facts and evidences, the Judicial Commissioner was found it a fit case to make an attachment absolute.	Reasoning
The High Court has confirmed the aforesaid order vide its judgment dated 21.06.2007.	Reasoning
In so far as submissions of learned counsel for the appellants regarding Kashmere Gate property, which was purchased in 1955, learned counsel for the State has submitted that power to attach the property does not confine only to the properties acquired by illgotten money but to secure the property misappropriated, any property of the accused can be attached.	Reasoning
A perusal of Section 4 of Ordinance, 1944 indicate that power to attach the money or other property alleged to have been so procured is very much there.	Reasoning
Further, section provides that if it transpires that such money or other property is not available for attachment, such other property of the said person of equivalent value as the District Judge may think fit Thus, the power is not confined and the power can be exercised for attaching several properties to take care of the amount which alleged to be defaulted.	Reasoning
In the present case, in the order making the attachment absolute, following observations have been made In the present case annexureI to the main application shows that the amount allegedly received by O.P. No.1 from A.S.D. Chaibasa is Rs.	None
1,49,41,000/ AnnexureII to the main application shows the valuation of the attached properties to be Rs. 25 lacs which is much less than the amount said to have been procured by means of scheduled offences Thus, the submission that the property which was acquired in the year 1955 could not have been attached cannot be accepted.30.	None
The appellants in the present case virtually are asking us to reappraise the evidence and record a finding that the properties attached were purchased by them of their own finances which exercise need not be gone into for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 136 in facts and circumstances of the present case.	Reasoning
In result, all the appeals are dismissed.	Decision
