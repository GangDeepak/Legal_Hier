 Vineet Saran, J. Leave granted.	None
The question for consideration in the present appeal is as to whether an Arbitration Award, which determined the compensation amount for the land to be paid under agreement for sale, can be directed to be executed as a suit for specific performance of agreement, when the reference to the Arbitrator (as per the agreement) was only for fixation of price of land in question, and the Arbitration Award was also only with regard to the same.

The Award thus attained finality.	Facts
It was thereafter that on 16.05.1994, the respondent Company filed an application for execution of the Award.	Facts
In the said application, it was stated that according to the directions contained in the Award of the Arbitrator, the petitioner Hindustan Corporation Limited, is required to furnish stamp paper to the respondent for execution of the sale deed .	Facts
The prayer made in the said application was that the appellants herein be directed to take steps and execute the sale deed on the stamp papers filed by the respondent herein and thereafter produce the sale deed before the Sub Registrar for its registration.	Facts
In the alternative, it was prayed that if the appellants herein failed to execute the sale deed, the same may be executed by the Court.	Facts
In response to the same, the appellants filed its reply on 19.7.1994 opposing the execution application and specially denied that any such direction for the execution of the sale deed, as has been made in the prayer of the application by the respondent herein, was made in the Award of the Arbitrator.	Facts
By judgment and order dated 05.01.1995, the Additional District JudgeI, Bharatpur, exercising its power under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, allowed the application of the respondent herein and directed the appellants to execute and register the sale deed and hand over possession of the land in question to the respondent herein.	Facts
Aggrieved by the judgment of the Additional District JudgeI, Bharatpur, dated 05.01.1995, the appellants filed Civil Revision Petition No. 81 of 1995 before the Rajasthan High Court.	Facts
During the pendency of the Civil Revision Petition filed by the appellants, the respondentCompany filed Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 against the appellants seeking specific performance of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 between the parties i.e., the appellants and the respondent Company.	Facts

The High Court opined that the Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 was filed by the respondent Company as a matter of abundant precaution but was later withdrawn and mere filing of the Civil Suit would not amount to admission by the respondentCompany that the Award and subsequent order based on it, were not suitable and enforceable.	Facts
Upholding the order of the Additional District JudgeI dated 05.01.1995, the Civil Revision Petition was dismissed by the Rajasthan High Court.	Facts
Aggrieved by the said judgment dated 04.07.2016, this appeal has been filed by way of Special Leave Petition.	Facts
The submission of Mr. Sudhir Chandra Agarwala, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants is that the Executing Court has travelled beyond the Award while passing the order dated 05.01.1995, inasmuch as by the Arbitration Award dated 09.06.1985 only price of the land in question was determined by the Arbitrator and it did not declare, create or confer any right, title or interest in the land in question in favour of the respondent Company.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that by the Agreement dated 01.02.1980, the appellants had agreed to sell their land to the respondentCompany at the rate to be fixed in future by an Arbitrator, and the respondentCompany was given an option in the agreement to be exercised within a period of 45 days of the fixing of the price by the Arbitrator, either to purchase or decline to purchase the land.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, according to the learned Senior Counsel, the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 was to result in a concluded contract only after the respondentCompany had either given its consent to purchase the land at the price fixed by the Arbitrator or declined to do so.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was thus contended that the respondent had not acquired any enforceable right even at the time of the passing of the Award, as there did not exist any concluded contract between the parties even at the time of the passing of the Award, as the contractual obligations of the parties were to arise subsequent to the passing of the Award and only after the respondentCompany had exercised its option of purchasing the land at the price fixed by the Arbitrator.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior Counsel contended that the Executing Court could not have gone behind or beyond the Award, and thus could not have considered the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 entered into between the parties.	Arguments of Petitioner
The scope of reference to the Arbitrator being only with regard to determination of the price of land at which it may be sold by the appellants to the respondentCompany, thus in execution of the Award, no direction for execution of the sale deed by the appellants in favour of the respondentCompany in pursuance of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 could have been issued by Executing Court, especially when the suit for specific performance of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 had been withdrawn by the respondentCompany on 13.02.2006, which was without any condition.	Arguments of Petitioner
13. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants further submitted that any instrument or award creating right, title or interest in an immoveable property would be required to be compulsorily registered under Registration Act, and the same having not been registered, could not be executable.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that neither the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 nor the Award dated 09.06.1985, was registered in the present case.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was vehemently urged that when the respondentCompany was barred for seeking execution of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 (which was not registered) and also when the Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 filed by the respondentCompany for specific performance dated 01.02.1980 was dismissed as unconditionally withdrawn on an application filed under Order XXXIII Rule 1 Code of Civil Procedure by the respondent on 06.02.2006, the execution of the said agreement dated 01.02.1980 (while deciding the application under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1940) in execution of the Award determining the price of the land could not have been passed.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the alternative, it was contended that the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 was not enforceable also because the same had been obtained by undue influence.	Arguments of Petitioner
14.	Arguments of Petitioner
With regard to the price of land as determined in the Award of the Arbitrator, on merits, it was submitted that the price which was fixed as on 27.11.1978, and not the date on which the sale deed was to be executed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Since the price fixed was a meagre amount of Rs. 12.18 lacs for about 145 bighas (about 5560 acres) of land, the fixation of the price under the Award was highly unreasonable as the present value of the land would be in crores.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the end, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants submitted that as proposed and recorded in this Courts Order dated 23.02.2007 in this appeal, the appellants were ready to compensate the respondentCompany towards costs of litigation and other expenses incurred by it, which the appellants are still ready and willing to pay.	Arguments of Petitioner
While concluding his submission, learned Senior Counsel reiterated that the Executing Court had grossly erred and exceeded its jurisdiction in travelling beyond the Award, which was only for fixation of the price of land and not execution of sale deed.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was thus urged that the orders dated 05.01.1985 passed by the Executing Court and the order dated 04.07.2016 passed by the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Revision Petition, be quashed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra	None
Shri Dushyant Dave and Shri Sidharth Dave, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondentCompany contended that this is not a case where the Court should exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution as the appellants had agreed to sell the land in question in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980, at the price to be fixed by the Arbitrator, and once the Arbitrator had fixed price of land, the execution of the same, as directed by the Executing Court, was perfectly justified.	Arguments of Respondent
It was the solemn agreement entered into between the parties in the year 1980, which was sought to be executed after the passing of the Award of the Arbitrator on 09.06.1985 and by directing execution of sale deed, the Executing Court has done substantial justice between the parties.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been contended that the appellants had never filed any suit for declaration that the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 was void by virtue of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, nor did it ever raise the challenge to the validity and legality of the agreement while assailing the Award or while resisting the execution proceedings.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Senior Counsel submitted that it was wrong to allege that the agreement entered into by the appellants was purportedly under coercion.	Arguments of Respondent
The agreement always remained binding between the parties and was executable after the determination of price of land in question by the Arbitrator, and the appellants could not seek to wriggle out of the same on any count.	Arguments of Respondent
The quantum of price of the land as fixed by the Arbitrator could not now be reagitated on the ground that the current market value of the land is very high.	Arguments of Respondent
It was then contended that the power of the Executing Court was very wide and it was its duty to give effect to the Award of the Arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
It was thus urged that the scope and power of the Executing Court has been held to be wide enough to interpret the Award, the agreement upon which the Award is based, and also the pleadings.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, while considering the above, the Executing Court was justified in ordering the execution of the agreement and by having done so, it was not only justified and suitable in the facts of the present case, but the Court has done complete justice between the parties.	Arguments of Respondent
As regards the filing the Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 for specific performance of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 by the respondentCompany, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent  Company has submitted that on receiving legal advice, the said Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 was withdrawn on 13.02.2006, as the petition for execution of the Award was already pending.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been submitted that the contention that filing of the Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 for specific performance of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 tantamounts to admission on the part of the respondentCompany that the Award did not envisage direction for execution of sale deed and handing over the possession of the land in question, is wholly misconceived, as in any case, there cannot be any admission against the law.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent thus contended that the appeal is devoid of merits, and deserves to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
In the end, with regard to the order of this Court dated 23.02.2017 passed in this appeal, giving suggestion to the respondentCompany that whether the respondent Company would be satisfied if Rs.60 lacs was paid to it towards cost of litigation and other expenses made by it and put the controversy to the end, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent suggested that the respondentCompany would be, on the other hand, agreeable to deposit Rs.60 lacs to be paid to the appellants for putting a quietus to the litigation.	Arguments of Respondent
We have heard learned Senior Counsel for the parties at length and have perused the record.	None
Learned Senior Counsel for the parties have, in support of their respective submissions, relied on several decisions rendered by this Court, which shall be considered while dealing with their submissions.	None

If respondent accepted the same, it was to communicate to the appellant in 45 days, after which the appellant would be bound to execute the sale deed within 30 days of the delivery of the stamp deeds of transfer by the respondent to the appellant, and the consideration was to be paid before the SubRegistrar at the time of registration, and the appellant was to simultaneously deliver the possession.	None
(Note In the earlier agreement dated 16.02.1979, the provision was for the respondent to deposit the compensation amount in the bank account of the appellant, if the appellant was unwilling to accept the same, which was to be considered as valid payment.)	None
In the award dated 09.06.1985 passed by the sole Arbitrator, in the opening paragraph it was observed that by the Agreement dated 01.02.1980, the parties (i.e. appellant and respondent) had referred their dispute regarding determination of compensation of land to me as Sole Arbitrator.	Facts
While determining the question of price of land the Arbitrator held that I accordingly hold that the market value of the land shall be determined (as) on 27.11.1978.	Arguments of Petitioner
This was decided on the basis that the initial Minutes of the meeting prior to the agreement were recorded on the said date i.e. 27.11.1978.	None

It is noteworthy that the reference to Arbitrator was only with regard to the determination of price of land of 145 bighas or the compensation to be awarded to the appellant by the respondent for the said land, which is clear from the very observation of the Arbitrator in award that the parties had referred their dispute regarding determination of compensation of land to me as Sole Arbitrator , meaning thereby the Arbitrator was to declare the price of land compensation to be paid for the land by the respondent to the appellant, and nothing more.	None
In the aforesaid facts of this case, the only question which arise for determination by this Court is as to whether the reference to the Arbitrator, in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980, was merely for fixation of price of land to be sold by the appellant to the respondent in terms of the agreement, and if that be so, could a direction to execute the sale deed have been issued vide order dated 04.07.2016, even though the Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 seeking specific performance of Agreement dated 01.02.1980 filed by the respondent was unconditionally withdrawn by the respondent on 13.02.2006.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our considered opinion, in the facts of the present case, the answer to the same would be an emphatic no.	None
There cannot be any doubt that in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980, the Arbitrator was authorized to only fix the price of the land which was to be sold by the appellant to the respondent as per the aforesaid agreement.	Reasoning
In the said Agreement dated 01.02.1980, there was an option given to the respondent to either accept the price fixed by the Arbitrator and go ahead with the sale deed, or to refuse to get the sale deed executed at the price fixed by the Arbitrator.	Reasoning
Thus, there was no certainty that the sale was to be executed at the price fixed by the Arbitrator.	Reasoning
As such, it was the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 alone which could have been executed at the price fixed by the Arbitrator, in case the respondent agreed to the same.	Reasoning
After the passing of the Award by the Arbitrator dated 09.06.1985, which was later confirmed and made Rule of the Court by the Rajasthan High Court on 01.12.1993 and the Special Leave Petition filed by the appellant against the said order was dismissed on 29.03.1994 and the Award had attained finality, the respondent filed a Civil Suit No.60 of 1996 for specific performance of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980.	Reasoning
It was this suit for specific performance of agreement under which a direction could have been issued for execution of the sale deed in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980.	Reasoning
However, the same was unconditionally withdrawn on 13.02.2006, on an application filed by the respondent on 06.02.2006.	Reasoning
With the withdrawal of such suit for specific performance, the matter with regard to the execution of the sale deed in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 came to an end.	Reasoning
The effect of withdrawing Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996 would be that the plaintiff therein (respondent herein) had abandoned its claim of execution of the sale deed in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980, which would be clear from the provisions of Rule 1(4) of Order XXIII CPC.	Reasoning
From the facts of this case, it is clear that the Award passed by the Arbitrator could not be independently executed, as the same was only for fixation of price of land and not for enforcement of the Agreement.	Reasoning
The Award was only declaratory of the price of the land.	Reasoning
As per the agreement, if the respondent agreed to the price so fixed, it could then get the sale deed executed in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 as it had the option of either accepting the price and getting the sale deed executed, or not accepting the price and thus not getting the sale deed executed.	Reasoning
This would clearly mean that the Award was merely for the declaration of the price of the land, which would be subject to the agreement and it was not necessary for the respondent to get the sale deed executed at the price so determined by the Arbitrator.	Reasoning
What was thus executable was the agreement, and not the Award.	Reasoning
The relief granted by the Court below for execution of the sale deed in terms of the Award, is thus outside the realm of law, as the Award did not contemplate the transfer of land in favour of the respondent, but only determined the price of land.	Reasoning
It is also noteworthy that the application for execution of Award filed on 16.05.1994 before the Additional District JudgeI, Bharatpur did not provide for any provision of law under which the same was filed.	Reasoning
Though, in paragraph 2 of the said application, it was mentioned that the Award of the Arbitrator contained a direction for execution of the Award, but in fact there was no such direction issued in the Award, in which the Arbitrator had only fixed the price of the land and nothing more.	Reasoning
In our view, once the respondent had given up its claim of execution of sale deed in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 by withdrawing the suit for specific performance of the agreement (Civil Suit No. 60 of 1996), which was permitted to be withdrawn unconditionally on 13.02.2006, the appellant had abandoned its claim for execution of the sale deed.	Reasoning
Thus, in our opinion, the respondent could not be permitted to achieve the goal of execution of sale deed by indirectly claiming for execution of Award, when the direct claim for execution of sale deed of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 had been abandoned by the respondent.	Reasoning
At the cost of repetition, it may be mentioned that the specific performance could only be of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 and not of the Award dated 09.06.1985.	Reasoning
Even the operative portion of the Award also does not give any direction for execution of the sale deed.	Reasoning
It was after the passing of the Award that the respondent could have fallen back on the agreement for execution of the sale deed, which respondent did by filing the suit for specific performance, but abandoned such claim by withdrawing the suit unconditionally.	Reasoning
The submission of the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that substantial justice has been done by the Court by directing execution of the sale deed, is not worthy of acceptance.	Reasoning
In a Civil Case, the Courts have to follow the law in letter and spirit, which has not been done in the present case, as in law the sale deed could have been directed to be executed in execution of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 and not the Award, which was only a declaration, fixing the price of land.	Reasoning
This Court, while considering the question of execution of a decree which only declared the rights of the decree holder and nothing more, has in the case of State of M.P. vs. Mangilal Sharma (1998) 2 SCC 510 held as follows A declaratory decree merely declares the right of the decreeholder visvis the judgmentdebtor and does not in terms direct the judgmentdebtor to do or refrain from doing any particular act or thing.	None
Since in the present case decree does not direct reinstatement or payment of arrears of salary the executing court could not issue any process for the purpose as that would be going outside or beyond the decree.	None
The respondent as a decreeholder was free to seek his remedy for arrears of salary in the suit for declaration.	None
The executing court has no jurisdiction to direct payment of salary or grant any other consequential relief which does not flow directly and necessarily from the declaratory decree In Coal Linker vs. Coal India Ltd. (2009) 9 SCC 491 , where this Court was considering an Award of an Arbitrator whereby interest was awarded for certain period but not for other period, and executing court had awarded interest for such period also, this Court held as under Admittedly, in the instant case interest has been granted by the arbitrator in the award for the first two periods.	None
But interest has not been granted by the arbitrator in the award for the last period.	None
As noted above, the appellant awardee herein, filed an application under Section 17 of the Act for pronouncing a judgment in terms of the award.	None
So there is no scope for the executing court to go beyond the award and grant interest for the postaward period which was not granted in the award.	None
Here the executing court has gone beyond the award and thus had gone beyond its jurisdiction and passed a decree which thus becomes a nullity.	None
While considering the power of the executing court for granting promotion which was not part of the decree, this Court in the case of JK Bank Ltd.	None
Vs. Jagdish C. Gupta (2004) 10 SCC 568 held as under The short question involved in the case is whether the executing court could go beyond the decree by directing that the respondent be promoted to the post of Chief Manager.	None
It is no more res integra that the executing court has no jurisdiction to go behind the decree.	None
It is not disputed that the decree did not contain any direction to promote the respondent to the post of Chief Manager.	None
Under such circumstances, we are of the view that the executing court as well as the High Court fell in error in issuing directions in execution case that the respondent be promoted to the post of Chief Manager.	None
The order under challenge, therefore, deserves to be set aside.	None
We order accordingly.	None
The appeal is allowed.	None
There shall be no order as to costs.	None
Similarly, in the case of Gurdev Singh vs. Narain Singh (2007) 14 SCC 173 , where the question of execution of a decree prayed for was beyond what was decreed, this Court held as follows We agree with the said contention.	None
A bare perusal of the decree in question would clearly demonstrate that the appellant herein was restrained by a permanent injunction from planting any tree on Khasra No. 17/2 on the one side and Khasra Nos.	None
218/1 and 17/1 on the other side.	None
The decree did not speak of removal of any tree which had already been planted.	None
The executing court, as noticed hereinbefore, while interpreting the said decree proceeded completely on a wrong premise to hold that there should not be any tree within two karams on either side of the common boundary of the parties.	None
Such an interpretation evidently is not in consonance with the tenor of the decree.	None
A jurisdictional error, thus, has been committed by the High Court.	None
It is well settled that executing court cannot go behind the decree.	None
As the decree did not clothe the decreeholder to pray for execution of the decree by way of removal of the trees, the same could not have been directed by the learned executing court in the name of construing the spirit of the decree under execution.	None
It is thus clear that execution of an award can be only to the extent what has been awarded decreed and not beyond the same.	None
In the present case, the Arbitrator in its Award had only declared the price of land and nothing more.	Reasoning
Thus, the question of execution of a sale deed of the land at the price so declared by the Arbitrator in its Award, could not be directed.	Reasoning
Even otherwise, there cannot be any equity in favour of the respondent, as neither any amount was paid nor deposited by the respondent.	Reasoning
No earnest money was also paid by the respondent.	Reasoning
It was only the stamp paper worth Rs.1,21,870/, which was deposited by the respondent along with a deposit of Rs.5,500/ in Court at the time of filing of the application on 16.05.1994 for execution of the Award.	Reasoning
It is also noteworthy that neither the Agreement dated 01.02.1980 nor the Award dated 09.06.1985 had been registered under the Registration Act, 1908.	Reasoning
This Court in the case of Ramesh Kumar vs. Furu Ram (2011) 8 SCC 613 had considered the effect of nonregistration of an Arbitration Award relating to right, title and interest in an immovable property and held as under Thus the awards are clearly documents which purport or operate to create and declare a right, title or interest in an immovable property of the value of more than Rs 100 which was not the subject of the dispute or reference to arbitration.	None
Therefore, the awards were compulsorily registrable.	None
If they were not registered, they could not be acted upon under Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908 nor could a decree be passed in terms of such unregistered awards.	None
Although, in the present case, the Award did not relate to right, title or interest in an immovable property and was only for determination of the price of land, yet if the execution court was to treat the same for execution of sale deed of land (immovable property), it ought to have considered the impact of nonregistration of such Award, which has not been done in the present case.	Reasoning
In support of his contention that the powers of the executing Court are wide enough, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has relied on the decision of this Court in the case of Bhavan Vaja vs Solanki Hanuji Khodaji Mansang (1973) 2 SCC 40 , wherein it has been held that 20For Construing a decree it can and in appropriate cases, it ought to take into consideration the pleadings as well as the proceedings leading up to the decree.	Arguments of Respondent
In order to find out the meaning of the words employed in a decree the Court, often has to ascertain the circumstances under which those words came to be used.	Arguments of Respondent
That is the plain duty of the execution Court and if that Court fails to discharge that duty it has plainly failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it The question in the present case is different, which is as to whether the execution of an award could have been directed in the absence of there being any direction in the Award for execution of the sale deed, which direction could have been given only in the case of execution of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980.	None
The question under consideration in the aforesaid case was that of a decree which was under execution, whereas there was no such decree passed by any Court which was to be executed in the present case.	Reasoning
The facts of the present case are thus distinguishable from those in the aforesaid case.	Reasoning
Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent has also relied on the decisions of this Court rendered in Meenakshi Saxena vs ECGC Limited (2018) 7 SCC 479 as well as Topanmal Chhotamal vs Kundomal Gangaram AIR 1960 SC 388 , which in our opinion are both distinguishable on facts.	Arguments of Respondent
In the case of Meenakshi Saxena (supra), there was a clear verdict of the Consumer Court, which was to be executed by the Court.	None
In paragraph 17 of the said judgment, this Court held that the whole purpose of the execution proceedings is to enforce the verdict of the Court.	None
Executing court while executing the decree is only concerned with the execution part of it but nothing else.	None
The court has to take the judgment in its face value.	None
In the case of Topanmal (supra), the decree under consideration was against the partnership firm and was to be executed against the personal assets of the partners.	None
In paragraph 4 of the said judgment, this Court held that at the worst the decree can be said to be ambiguous.	None
In such a case it is the duty of the executing Court to construe the decree.	None
For the purpose of interpreting a decree, when its terms are ambiguous, the Court would certainly be entitled to look into the pleadings and the judgment see Manakchand v. Manoharlal, 71 Ind. App. 65 (AIR 1944 P.C. 46).	None
In the plaint in the Agra suit, Suit No. 205 of 1949, not only relief was asked for against the firm, but also a personal decree was claimed against defendants 2 to 6.	None
In the present case, the Court is concerned about execution of the Award and not the Agreement.	None
In the Award passed by the Arbitrator, the price of land was fixed, which was to be executed in terms of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980, and that too at the option of the respondent.	Reasoning
Thus, there could be no direction to execute the sale deed at the price fixed in the Award, that too in a petition for execution of the Award, without there being any prayer for execution of the Agreement dated 01.02.1980.	Reasoning
Going behind the decree for doing complete justice would not mean that the entire nature of the case could be changed, and what was not awarded in favour of the respondent, could be granted by the executing court.	Reasoning
It was only after the respondent had exercised its right to purchase the land at the price fixed by the Arbitrator that a right to enforce the Agreement could have arisen in favour of the respondent.	Reasoning
The Award of the Arbitrator, in the present case, in itself was not a conclusive contract between the parties, which could be executed.	Reasoning
For the reason given hereinabove, we are of the definite opinion that the impugned judgment of the Rajasthan High Court dated 04.07.2016 passed in Civil Revision Petition No. 81 of 1985, upholding the order of the Additional District Judge dated 05.01.1995 is liable to be quashed, and is hereby quashed, and this appeal deserves to be allowed.	Decision
Now what is to be next considered by this Court is as to whether any compensation is to be awarded in favour of the respondent, keeping in view the interim order passed by this Court on 02.09.2016, which is reproduced below Issue notice returnable within eight weeks.	Issue
There shall be stay of operation of the impugned judgment subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs.50,00,000/ (Rupees fifty lac only) before the Registry of this Court within six weeks hence.	None
In terms of the said order, the petitioner has deposited Rs.50,00,000/ with the Registry of this Court, which has been directed to be placed in a shortterm fixed deposit account.	None
Then on, 23.02.2017, this Court passed the following order In the course of hearing, it was put to Mr. Gopal Jain, learned senior counsel for the respondent, whether by virtue of the award passed by the learned Arbitrator, could the respondent become the owner of the property, more so when the award has not been registered as per the Stamps Act.	None
Additionally, it was also put to him whether when the suit for specific performance of the contract was withdrawn, could he get right, title and interest on the basis of the award passed by the Arbitrator, who had entered into reference on the basis of intervention by an authority who wanted that the parties should negotiate and arrive at a settlement.	None
Be it noted, prima facie, the award relates to quantification of the price and, therefore, the issue that would arise for consideration is whether determination of price creates any right, title and interest in the respondent.	None
Apart from all these questions, a suggestion was given to the learned counsel for the respondent as to whether he would, apart from money he claims to have deposited before the District Court, be satisfied to take Rs.60,00,000/ for the cost of litigation and other expenses made by him and put the controversy to an end.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
When the aforesaid facts were put to the learned Counsel for the parties, Mr. Sudhir Chandra Agarwala learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner agreed to pay such amount towards cost of litigation and other expenses to the respondent, as may be fixed determined by this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our view, in the aforesaid facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the opinion that the amount so deposited by the appellant, in terms of the interim orders passed by this Court, along with interest accrued thereon, shall be paid to the respondent, and besides this a further sum of Rs.10,00,000/ shall also be paid by the appellant to the respondent within six weeks from today, which all would be towards the cost of litigation and other expenses incurred by the respondent.	Decision
With this, a quietus would be put to the long drawn litigation between the parties.	Decision
Accordingly, this appeal stands allowed in terms of the directions given hereinabove	Decision
