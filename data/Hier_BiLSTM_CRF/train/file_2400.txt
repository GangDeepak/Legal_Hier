On or about 17.1.1969 Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1969 came into being which inter alia contained a provision relating to grant of selection scale in terms of Rules 23 thereof which reads as under Appointments to posts in the Selection Grade Appointments to the posts in the selection grade of the service shall be made by the Governor in consultation with the Court on the basis of merit.6.	Facts
On or about 30th of April, 1990 a Committee of two Honble Judges of the said Court was constituted by the Full Court for the purpose of consideration of individual merit of the judicial officers of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service (RHJS) relating to appointment to selection scale.	Facts
Pursuant to or in furtherance thereof a Committee of two Judges considered the same and suggested that last five years of ACRs to be considered in the merit criteria therefor.	Facts
However, the Full Court by Resolution dated 5th October, 1990 took a decision to take into consideration three good ACRs out of five ACRs only for the said purpose.	Facts
As regards grant of super time scale to Rajasthan Judicial Service, the Full Bench of the High Court by a Resolution dated 14.8.1997 adopted the criteria of five good ACRs out of seven ACRs for grant of super time scale.7.	Facts
The Acting Chief Justice of the High Court, however, constituted a Committee consisting of two Judges of the said Court to consider examine and to make recommendations for formation of officiating promotee RHJS officers for their substantive appointment in their service and for promotion of RHJS officers in the ordinary scale to selection scale by an order dated 26th March, 1998.	Facts
The Committee submitted its report on 30th March, 1998, upon considering the cases of all eligible candidates in the light of the existing Rules as also the Full Court Resolutions.	Facts
With a view to arrive at its finding, the Committee, however, found those officers fit and meritorious for grant of selection grade who obtained at least five outstanding very good good ACRs out of seven and where no adverse entry was recorded.	Facts
As regards those, whose a ACRs have not been recorded for one reason or the other, the Committee deferred consideration of their cases for the time being.	Facts
The Committee, however filed an additional report on 27.4.1999 whose cases were deferred earlier.8.	Facts
The matter was placed before the Full Court on 30th April, 1999 by the Chief Justice.	Facts
Twenty Honble Judges of the High Court participated therein.	Facts
By Resolution dated 30th April, 1999, the Full Court considered the report submitted by the said two Judges Committee and approved the name of 25 officers who were found fit for grant of selection scale.	Facts
The cases of the respondents herein along with four others, however, were deferred.	Facts
The matter relating to the additional report of the said two Judges Committee was again placed before the Full Court on 27.11.1999.	Facts
It accepted the report of the Committee and declined to grant selection scale to the respondents herein.	Facts
Pursuant to or in furtherance of the aforementioned recommendations made by the High Court, the Governor by a notification dated 5.2.2000 made appointment to the officers of Higher Judicial Service named therein to the post of selection grade with effect from the date mentioned against their names respectively.9.	Facts
The first respondent in each of these appeals filed writ petitions questioning nongrant of selection grade to them by filing writ petitions before the Jaipur Bench of the Rajasthan High Court.10.	Facts
By reason of the impugned judgment the High Court inter alia held(1)	Facts
The Acting Chief Justice was not authorised to constitute the two Judges Committee, and, thus, it could not make lay down any merit criteria.(2) As all the Judges of the High Court have not been consulted, the Committee appointed by the Acting Chief Justice alone could not evolve the merit criteria in view of subrule (h) of Rule 15 of 1952 Rules.(3)	Facts
The earlier policy decision adopted by the Full Court could not be changed as Rule 15 of 1952 provides for prior consultation of the Judges of the High Court and as all Judges were not consulted in the matter subsequent approval thereof could not cure illegality.11.	Facts
The said writ petitions were disposed of with the following directions We direct the respondents to consider the cases of all the three petitioners afresh against the vacancies occasioned in 1998 and 1999 in view of the merit criterion evolved and approved by the Full Court in the year 1990 and 1994.	Facts
If they are found eligible for promotion to selection scale of the RIIJS, they can be accorded the selection scale by creating supernumerary posts in terms of Rule 18 of the Rajasthan Service Rules.(ii)	Facts
This decision shall not affect the order dated February 5, 2000 whereby selection scale of the RHJS was granted to twenty six officers.(iii)	Facts
The fresh consideration as directed above is expected to be done as expeditiously as possible, in the meanwhile three posts in the selection scale of the RHJS shall be kept vacant.	Facts
However, it was observed It is however made clear that though we have declared the entire exercise of the respondents in granting selection scale as illegal yet we do not intend to unsettle the grant of selection scale to twenty six judicial officers as they are not before us.	Facts
We, therefore, direct that this decision shall not affect the order dated February 5, 2000 of the respondent whereby selection scale was granted to twenty six judicial officers.	Facts
But if the petitioners, after consideration of their service record from 1993 to 1997 and from 1994 to 1998 are found eligible for selection scale, they shall be considered with reference to the selection of 1998 and 1999 when their junior colleagues were promoted.	Facts
The petitioners in that event can be accorded the selection scale of the RHJS by creating supernumerary posts in terms of Rule 18 of the Rajasthan Service Rules.	Facts
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that having regard to the provisions of the Rules, the High Court must be held to have committed an error in holding that the Acting Chief Justice had no jurisdiction to constitute the Committee.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that once it is held that the Acting Chief Justice had the jurisdiction to constitute a Committee and the decision of the said Committee was approved by the Full Court, the earlier policy decision must be held to have been varied by the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel in support of the said contentions has placed strong reliance in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Batuk Deo Pati Tripathi and Another reported in (1978) 2 SCC 102 ), Brij Nath Pandey vs. State of U.P. and Others (JT 2000 (9) SC 464 ), Registrar, High Court of Madras vs. R. Rajiah (1988) 3 SCC 211 ).13.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Surya Kant, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent in each case, would, on the other hand, submit that as the power of the Chief Justice to constitute a Committee is governed by a statutory rule, he must be held to have acted without jurisdiction in appointing the said Committee.	Arguments of Respondent
Strong reliance in support of the said contention has been placed in Orissa Small Industries Corpn.	Arguments of Respondent
Ltd. and Another vs. Narasingha Charan Mohanty and others (1999) 1 SCC 465 ).	Arguments of Respondent
The term Chief Justice will include the Judges authorised to act on his behalf in view of interpretation clause contained in Section 3, Chapter III of the Rules provides for administrative business of the Court.	None
In terms of Rule 14 of the Rules, Administrative Business of the Court relating to control over subordinate courts vested either under Article 235 or 227 of the Constitution of India were to be disposed of as provided therein.	None
The Rules have been made by the High Court.	None
The High Court, therefore, can also amend the rules.	None
It is not the case of the writ petitionersFirst respondents herein that the High Court had no jurisdiction to evolve the criteria for grant of selection scale to the officers of the Rajasthan Judicial Services or Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service.	None
It may be true that by reason of Resolution dated 5th October, 1990 the Full Court inter alia opined that for the purpose of grant of selection scale three good ACRs out of five ACRs were to be taken into consideration but the said decision of the Full Court was subject to amendment modification thereof.	None
A reading of the aforementioned rules clearly goes to show that the Chief Justice has the requisite jurisdiction to constitute a Committee and the report of the Committee upon consultations of all the Judges of the High Court in terms of Rule 15 shall become a decision of the Court.	None
Rule 29(2) and Rule 32 as quoted (supra) also clearly show that even no irregularity which might have taken place in the procedure laid down in Chapter III shall not affect the validity of the order passed or anything done in the Rules and the same shall be deemed to be disposed of by the Court.	None
The legal fiction created must also be given its full effect.	None
It is beyond any pale of controversy that the control over the subordinate courts within the meaning of Article 235 of the Constitution of India is that of the High Court.	None
Such control of the High Court includes general superintendence of the working of the subordinate courts, disciplinary control over the Presiding Officers, disciplinary proceedings, transfer, confirmation and promotion and appointment etc.	None
Such control vested in the High Court is complete.	None
(See High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan vs. Ramesh Chand Paliwal, (1998) 3 SCC 72 , District Judges Baradakanta Mishra vs. High Court of Orissa (1976) 3 SCC 327 , High Court of Punjab vs. State of Haryana, (1975) 1 SCC 843 , Yoginath D. Bagde vs. State of Maharashtra (1999) 7 SCC 739 , State of Haryana vs. Inder Prakash Anand, (1976) 2 SCC 977 and State of Assam vs. S.N. Sen (1971) 2 SCC 9).	None
It is also true that the powers of the Chief Justice under Articles 235 and 229 of the Constitution of India are different and distinct.	None
Whereas control over the subordinate courts vests in the High Court as a whole, the control over the High Court vests in the Chief Justices only.	None
(See All India Judges  Association vs. Union of India (1992) 1 SCC 119 ).	None
However, the same does not mean that a Full Court cannot authorise the Chief Justice in respect of any matter whatsoever.	None
In relation to certain matters keeping the rest of it in itself by the Full Court, authorization to act on its behalf in favour of the Chief Justice on a Committee of Judges is permissible in law.	None
How far and to what extent such power has been or can be delegated would be discernible only from the rules.	None
Such a power by the Full Court can also be exercised from time to time.	None
The Judges of the Rajasthan High Court, as noticed hereinbefore, in terms of subrule (2) of Rule 21 of the Rules authorised the Chief Justice to constitute a committee.	None
Such constitution of the committee by the Chief Justice having been made in terms of the rules must be held to have been made by the High Court itself.	None
Such authorization is not a limited one as thereby the extent to which such authorization can be exercised has not been spelt out.	None
Furthermore, authorization in terms of subrule (2) of Rule 21 of the Rules having been laid down in Chapter III which relates to the Administrative Business of the Court, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever even in the matter of control of the High Court in terms of Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the Chief Justice of the High Court had the jurisdiction to exercise the said power.	None
Once such a resolution authorising the Chief Justice to constitute a committee has been passed having regard to the decision of this Court in the High Court of Judicature of Bombay vs. Shirish Kumar Rangrao Patil (1997) 6 SCC 339 ), there cannot be doubt whatsoever that the exercise of power by the Chief Justice in that behalf was absolutely valid.	None
It is, therefore, not correct to contend that the Chief Justice could appoint the twoJudges committee only with the approval of the Full Court.	None
Exercise of power by the Chief Justice, however, indisputably must be made in terms of the rules.	None
The questions raised in these appeals must, therefore, be considered from that angle.	None
The High Court, in our opinion, therefore, clearly erred in arriving at the aforementioned finding that the constitution of the committee was illegal.	Reasoning
The submission on behalf of the respondents to the effect that in the matter relating to fixation of criteria for the purpose of appointment to the selection grade, the twoJudges committee could not be made without consulting all the Judges is stated to be rejected.	Arguments of Respondent
The said submission is based on a total misconception.	None
Laying down the merit criteria for appointment to the selection grade also was within the domain of the High Court.	None
It could not only lay down such criteria but also amend or modify the same from the time to time.	None
For the said purpose also the Chief Justice could appoint a committee, the recommendation whereof was to be subject to the approval of the Full Court.	None
Rule 15 of the Rules does not say that before an action can be initiated in that behalf by the Chief Justice all the Judges are to be consulted.	None
Rule 15 of the Rules postulates a final decision in the matter specified therein and not initiation of process therefor.	None
It is also incorrect to contend that all the judges of the High Court are required to be consulted at a time.	None
The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents is again not correct in contending that the twoJudges Committee was not justified in evolving a merit criteria different from the one approved by the Full Court.	None
The twoJudges Committee did not take any final decision in that behalf.	None
It having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and upon consideration of the extant rules as well as the earlier decisions of the Full Court applied certain principles and criteria which inevitably was subject to approval of the Full Court.	None
The procedure for holding a Full Court meeting as quoted supra would clearly show that the meeting which had requisite quorum as contemplated under Rule 29 would amount to compliance of the Rules.	None
Although Rule 15 provides that all the Judges shall be consulted in the matters enumerated therein but Rule 18 provides for the mode and manner thereof.28.	Reasoning
If such consultation is to be made by circulation, undoubtedly, the relevant documents are required to be circulated to all the Judges.	Reasoning
In the event, however, such consultation is to be effect by placing the matter before a Full Court, all the Judges are therefor invited but the same would not mean that in the event, one or more Judge (s) does do not attend the Full Court, the resolution passed by it shall be invalid.	Reasoning
Rule 29 provides for a quorum.	Reasoning
In the case of a meeting of the Judges of the court, the quorum will be complete if onehalf or more of the Judges attend the same.	Reasoning
Consultation with all the Judges would, thus, not mean that even if some of the Judges do not choose to make themselves available in a Full Court Meeting, consultation with all the Judges shall not be complete.29.	Reasoning
We may notice that even in the Full Court meeting held on 26th November, 1966 all the Honble Judges of the High Court were not present.30.	Reasoning
The Committee was constituted for the purpose of considering the cases of concerned officers.	Reasoning
It is not and cannot be the case or the contention of the writ petitions that even for the purpose of considering the case of the eligible judicial officers at the threshold, it was absolutely necessary to place the matter before the Full Court.	Reasoning
The Acting Chief Justice constituted the Committee for a specific purpose.	Reasoning
The Committee merely submitted its opinion which was subject to approval by the Full Court.	Reasoning
Once the opinion of the matter is approved by the Full Court, in our opinion, it must be held that there had been a compliance of Rule 15 of the Rules.31.	Reasoning
Interpretation of a Statute depends upon the text and context thereof.	Reasoning
A Statute should be interpreted having regard to the purpose and object for which the same was made.	Reasoning
The Chief Justice of a High Court although first amongst the Judges, by the nature of office he holds, he is the head of the State Judiciary.	Reasoning
Authorisation by the Full Court in favour of the Chief Justice to constitute a Committee and or take actions for the subordinate judiciary must be viewed from that context.	Reasoning
Rule 15 of the Rules provides for such matters, which require consultations with the other Judges of the High Court.32.	Reasoning
Question of consultation with the Judges would not arise unless the subject matter therefor is identified.	Reasoning
It is for Honble the Chief Justice of the High Court to identify such matters and place the same before the Full Court with relevant papers and documents.33.	Reasoning
It is, therefore, axiomatic that not only the Chief Justice of High Court was free to initiate any proceedings and obtain the opinion of a Committee of Judges on such matters and the only legal requirement therefor is to place such proposals together with the opinion of the Committee before the Judges of the High Court so that the matter can be fully thrashed out.	Reasoning
Once the Full Court approves the recommendations made by the Committee of Judges, it becomes decision of the Court which could be sent to the Governor for acting thereupon.	Reasoning
An almost identical question came up for consideration whether the High Court can delegate its power to a Judge or a small Committee of the Judges of the Court so as to authorise it to act on this behalf in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Batuk Deo Pati Tripathi and Another (supra).	None
In no uncertain terms it was held The control vested in the High Courts by that article comprehends, according to our decisions, a large variety of matters like transfers, subsequent postings, leave, promotions other than initial promotions, imposition of minor penalties which do not fall within Article 311, decisions regarding compulsory retirements, recommendations for imposition of major penalties which fall within Article 311, entries in character rolls and so forth.	None
If every Judge is to be associated personally and directly with the decision on every one of these matters, several important matters pertaining to the High Courts administrative affairs will pile into arrears like court arrears.	None
In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that the control will be better and more effectively exercised if a smaller committee of Judges has the authority of the court to consider the manifold matters falling within the purview of Article 235.	None
Bearing in mind therefore the nature of the power which that article confers on the High Court, we are of the opinion that it is wrong to characterize as delegation the process whereby the entire High Court authorises a Judge or some of the Judges of the Court to act on behalf of the whole Court.	None
Such an authorization effectuates the purpose of Article 235 and indeed without it the control vested in the High Court over the subordinate courts will tend gradually to become lax and effective.	None
Administrative functions are only a part, though an important part, of the High Courts constitutional functions.	None
Judicial functions ought to occupy and do in fact consume the best part of a Judges time.	None
For balancing these twofold functions it is inevitable that the administrative duties should be left to be discharged by some on behalf of all the Judges.	None
Judicial functions brook no such sharing of responsibilities by any instrumentality.	None
In Registrar, High Court of Madras vs. R. Rajiah (supra), it was observed In Rajiahs case, a Review Committee consisting of three Judges was appointed by a resolution of the High Court.	None
In the meeting of the Review Committee held on June 25, 1979 to consider the case of the respondent Rajiah, only two judges of the High Court were present.	None
The two Judges came to the conclusion that the respondent.	None
Rajiah, should be compulsorily retired with effect from April 2, 1980.	None
The Division Bench found that the third judge had no notice of the meeting held on June 25, 1979, but he agreed with the view expressed by the two judges with a slight modification that the respondent would retire with effect from March 3, 1980 under Rule 56(d) of the Fundamental Rules.	None
The Division Bench of the High Court took the view that as all the three judges had not sat together and considered the question of compulsory retirement of respondent Rajiah, and that, further the third judge having also modified the decision of the two judges, namely, that the respondent would be compulsorily retired with effect from March 3, 1980, the impugned order of compulsory retirement of the respondent, Rajiah was vitiated.	None
It is true that the members of the Review Committee should sit together and consider the question of compulsory retirement, but simply because one of them did not participate in the meeting, and subsequently agreed with the view expressed by the other two judges, it would not vitiate the decision of the Committee to compulsorily retire the respondent.	None
The third judge might (sic not) be justified in correcting the date with effect from which the respondent would compulsorily retire, but that is a very minor issue and would not, in our opinion, make the decision invalid.24.	None
In regard to the case of the other respondent, namely, K. Rajeswaran, the High Court took the view that the constitution of the Review Committee by the Chief Judge and not by the Full Court was illegal.	None
We are unable to accept the view of the High Court.	None
We fail to understand why the Chief Justice cannot appoint a Review Committee or an Administrative Committee.	None
But in one respect the High Court is, in our opinion, correct, namely, that the decision of the Review Committee should have been placed before a meeting of the judges.	None
In the case of the respondent, K. Rajeswaran, the decision and recommendation of the Review Committee was not placed before the Full Court Meeting.	None
Nor is there any material to show that the same was circulated to the judges.	None
In that sense, the recommendation of the Review Committee was not strictly legal.	None
Furthermore, the terminology consultation used in Rule 15 having regard to purport and object thereof must be given its ordinary meaning.	Reasoning
In Words and Phrases (Permanent Edition, 1960, Volume 9, page 3) to consult is defined as to discuss something together, to deliberate Corpus Juris Secundum (Volume 16A, Ed. 1956, page 1242)	Reasoning
also says that the word consult is frequently defined as meaning to discuss something together, or to deliberate.	Reasoning
By giving an opportunity to consultation or deliberation the purpose thereof is to enable the Judges to make their respective points of view known to the others and discuss and examine the relative merits of their view.	Reasoning
It is neither in doubt nor in dispute that the Judges present in the meeting of the Full Court were supplied with all the requisite documents and had full opportunity to deliberate upon the Agenda in question.37.	Reasoning
There is another aspect of the matter which may require consideration.	Reasoning
For all intent and purport the report of the two Judges Committee has been approved by the Full Court.	Reasoning
Once approved, it terminated into a decision of the Full Court itself.	Reasoning
In the instant case even the Governor has acted upon the recommendations of the High Court.	Reasoning
The writ petitionerfirst respondents herein did not question the appointments of the appointees not the High Court.	Reasoning
Thus, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that for all intent and purport the opinion of the two Judges Committee received approval at the hands of the Full Court.38.	Reasoning
The High Court, in our opinion, further committed a manifest error in arriving at its conclusion in so far as it failed to take into consideration that Rule 15 does not postulate the prior approval of the Full Court in relation to any action which may be initiated by the Chief Justice.39.	Reasoning
When an approval is required, an action holds good.	Reasoning
Only if it disapproved it losses its force.	Reasoning
Only when a permission is required, the decision does not become effective till permission is obtained.	Reasoning
(See U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad and Another vs. Friends Coop.	Reasoning
Housing Society Ltd. and Another (1995) Supp (3) SCC 456	Reasoning
.	Reasoning
In the instant case both the aforementioned requirements have been fulfilled.40.	Reasoning
There is another aspect of the matter.	Reasoning
In terms of Rule 2(2) of the Rules, the decision of the Full Court would have a retrospective effect and retroactive operation.41.	Reasoning
In any view of the matter, even n a case where the initial action is illegal, the same can be ratified by a body competent therefor.	Reasoning
This aspect of the matter has not been considered by the High Court at all.	Reasoning
In Sri Parmeshwari Prasad Gupta vs. The Union of India (1973) 2 SCC 543 this Court held Even if it be assumed that the telegram and the letter terminating the services of the appellant by the Chairman was in pursuance to the invalid resolution of the Board of Directors passed on December 16, 1953 to terminate his services, it would not follow that the action of the Chairman could not be ratified in a regularly convened meeting of the Board of Directors.	None
The point is that even assuming that the Chairman was not legally authorised to terminate the services of the appellant, he was acting on behalf of the Company in doing so, because, he purported to act in pursuance of the invalid resolution.	None
Therefore, it was open to a regularly constituted meeting of the Board of Directors to ratify that action which, though unauthorized, was done on behalf of the Company.	None
Ratification would always relate back to the date of the act ratified and so it must be held that the services of the appellant were validly terminated on December 17, 1953 42.	None
(See also Marathwada University vs. Seshrao Balwant Rao Chavan (1989) 3 SCC 132 para 28, Babu Verghese and Others vs. Bar Council of Kerala and Others (1999) 3 SCC 422 para 35 and Barnard vs. National Dock Labour Board (1953) 1 All ER 1113).	None
In Orissa Small Industries Corpn. Ltd and Another vs. Narasingha Charan Mohanty and Others (supra) where upon the learned counsel has placed strong reliance, this Court held That apart, the Court is not entitled to assess the respective merit of the candidates for adjudging their suitability for being promoted and the only right the employee has is a right of consideration.	None
The said right of consideration not having been infringed in the present case, the High Court was not justified in issuing the impugned direction for consideration of his case The said decision, therefore, mutilates against the contentions of the respondents.	None
Furthermore, the first respondent herein in these cases Shri P.P. Singh, Shri G.P. Pandey has been granted selection scale in RHJS with effect from 1.8.2000 and Shri P.K. Bhatia has bee given with effect from 29.3.2000.	Reasoning
Shri P.P. Singh has also retired from service on superannuation.	Reasoning
We are of the opinion that impugned judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained which is set aside accordingly.	Decision
The appeals are allowed but in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.	Decision
