 K. Sikri, J. INTRODUCTION These appeals are filed by Formula One World Championship Limited (hereinafter referred to as FOWC), Jaypee Sports International Limited (for short, Jaypee) and Union of India (hereinafter referred to as the Revenue).	None
In all these appeals, challenge is laid to the judgment dated November 30, 2016 passed by the High Court of Delhi whereby three writ petitions preferred by FOWC, Jaypee and Revenue have been decided.	None
The matter originated from filing of applications by FOWC and Jaypee before the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR).	None
FOWC had entered into a Race Promotion Contract (RPC) dated September 13, 2011 with Jaypee, granting Jaypee the right to host, stage and promote the Formula One Grand Prix of India event for a consideration of US 40 million.	None
Some other agreements were also entered into between FOWC and Jaypee as well as group companies of FOWC and Jaypee, particulars whereby would be mentioned later at an appropriate stage.	Reasoning
In the applications filed by FOWC and Jaypee before the AAR, advance ruling of AAR was solicited on two main questions queries whether the payment of consideration receivable by FOWC in terms of the said RPC from Jaypee was or was not royalty as defined in Article 13 of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) entered into between the Government of United Kingdom and the Republic of India?	None
and whether FOWC was having any Permanent Establishment (PE) in India in terms of Article 5 of DTAA?	None
Another related question was also raised, viz., whether any part of the consideration received or receivable by FOWC from Jaypee outside India was subject to tax at source under Section 195 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter after referred to as the Act).	None
AAR answered the first question holding that the consideration paid or payable by Jaypee to FOWC amounted to Royalty under the DTAA.	None
Second question was answered in favour of FOWC holding that it did not have any PE in India.	None
As far as the question of subjecting the payments to tax at source under Section 195 of the Act is concerned, AAR ruled that since the amount received receivable by FOWC was income in the nature of Royalty and it was liable to pay tax there on to the Income Tax Department in India, it was incumbent upon Jaypee to deduct the tax at source on the payments made to FOWC.	None
FOWC and Jaypee challenged the ruling on the first issue by filing writ petitions in the High Court contending that the payment would not constitute Royalty under Article 13 of the DTAA.	None
Revenue also filed the writ petition challenging the answer of the AAR on the second issue by taking the stand that FOWC had PE in India in terms of Article 5 of the DTAA and, therefore, tax was payable accordingly.	None
As mentioned above, all these three writ petitions have been decided by the High Court vide common judgment dated November 30, 2016.	None
Interestingly, the High Court has reversed the findings of the AAR on both the issues.	None
Whereas it has held that the amount paid payable under RPC by Jaypee to FOWC would not be treated as Royalty, as per the High Court FOWC had the PE in India and, therefore, taxable in India.	None
While deciding this question, the High Court has not accepted the plea of the Revenue that it was not a dependent PE.	None
The High Court has also held, as the sequitur, that Jaypee is bound to make appropriate deductions from the amount payable to FOWC under Section 195 of the Act.	None
It is for this reason all the three parties are again before us.	None
As per FOWC and Jaypee, no tax is payable in India on the consideration paid under RPC as it is neither Royalty nor FOWC has any PE in India.	None
It is pertinent to mention that the Revenue has not challenged the findings of the High Court that the amount paid under RPC does not constitute royalty.	None
Therefore, that aspect of the matter has attained finality.	None
The main question in the appeals, therefore, pertains to PE.	None
FACTUAL MATRIX	None
In order to decide this question, following facts, having bearing on the matter, need a recapitulation Federation Internationale de I Automobile (for short, FIA), a nonprofit association, is established as the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus to represent the interests of motoring organizations and motor car users globally.	None
FIA, as the federation of the worlds leading motoring organizations and the governing body for motorsports worldwide, consists of 213 national member organizations in 125 countries internationally.	Facts
FIA is the principal body for establishing the rules and regulations for all major international fourwheel motorsport events.	Facts
FIA is a regulatory body it regulates the FIA Formula One World Championship (Championship) which has been the premier form of motor racing since its inception in 1950.	Facts
This Championship is established and run every year subsequently since.	Facts
The Championship is an annual series of motor races, conducted in the name and style of the Grand Prix over a three day duration at purposebuilt circuits, and in some cases, across public roads, in different countries around the world.	Facts
The Championship is considered the most prestigious motor sport series in the world.	Facts
Formula One (F1) refers to the rules and regulations that define the characteristics of the race, as opposed to any other form of motor race.	Facts
Thus, the formula, is with reference to a set of rules that all participants cars must conform to.	Facts
F1 seasons consist of a series of races, known as Grand Prix (from French, meaning grand prizes), held across the world on specially designed and built F1 circuits across 26 different locales.	Facts
F1 Grand Prix events are held under the aegis of the FIA Formula One World Championships competition  in which F1 racing cars, assembled and manufactured strictly in terms of the F1 technical regulations, compete against each other, under F1 Sporting Regulations and the F1 International Sporting Code framed and made effective by the FIA.	Facts
F1 drivers across the world have the ability, competence and skill to drive an F1 car and participate in F1 racing events.	Facts
About 12 to 15 teams typically compete in these Championship in any one annual racing season.	Facts
Some celebrated and wellknown participating teams are the Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull etc.	Facts
The teams assemble and construct their vehicles, which comply with defined technical specifications, and engage drivers who can successfully manoeuvre the F1 cars in the racing events.	Facts
FOWC is incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, and is a tax resident of the United Kingdom.	Facts
It is the Commercial Rights Holder (CRH) in respect of the Championship with effect from January 01, 2011.	Facts
FOWC has entered into an agreement with the FIA and Formula One Asset Management Limited (FOAM).	Facts
Under these agreements, FOAM licensed all commercial rights in the FIA Formula One World Championship (hereinafter referred to as F1 Championship) to FOWC for 100 year term effective from January 01, 2011.	Facts
As mentioned above, the teams which participate in F1 World Championship Competitions have to strictly comply with the terms and conditions set out for such competitions as per Sporting Regulations and Sporting Code.	Facts
For this purpose, all these teams, known as Constructors, enter into a contract, known as the Concorde Agreement, with FOWC and the FIA.	Facts
In these agreements, they undertake to participate to the best of their ability, in every F1 event included in the official annual F1 racing calendar.	Facts
They also bind themselves to an unequivocal negative covenant with FOWC that they would not participate in any other similar motor racing event whatsoever nor would they promote in any manner any other rival event.	Facts
The F1 racing teams exclusively participate in about 19 to 21 listed F1 annual racing events on the official racing calendar, set by the FIA.	Facts
This is, in effect, a closed circuit event since no team other than those bound by contract with FOWC are permitted participation.	Facts
Thus, on the one hand, participating teams enter into Concorde Agreement.	None
Likewise, promoters are also chosen for holding these F1 racing events.	Facts
Every F1 racing event is hosted, promoted and staged by a promoter with whom FOWC as the right holder, enters into contract and whose event is nominated by the CRH (i.e. Commercial Right Holder, which is in effect, FOWC) to the FIA for inclusion in the official F1 racing calendar.	Facts
In other words, FOWC is the exclusive nominating body at whose instance the event promoter is permitted participation.	Facts
The points scored by each F1 racing team in every event is listed in the official racing calendar and it counts towards the Constructors Championship and the Drivers Championship for the racing season as a whole.	Facts
Any teams position in these Championships at the end of the season determines, together with certain other factors which are elaborately dealt with in the Concorde Agreements (which in the present instance, was latest in the series of Concorde Agreements the last being the one of 2009 i.e. August 05, 2009), the prize money payable to the teams for their participation during the season.	Facts
Grant of a right to host, stage and promote the F1 racing event, therefore, carries with it a covenant or representation that F1 racing teams with their cars, drivers and other auxiliary and supporting staff will participate in the motor racing event hosted at the promoters motor racing circuit displaying the highest levels of technical skill achievement etc. in the fields of construction of single seat motorcars to attain the highest levels of performance in the world.	Facts
These teams and the FOWC also represent that the highest levels of skill in racing management and maintenance of the cars would be on display in the event.	Facts
All these are a part of the relevant contractual provisions, embodied in RPC 2011.	Facts
In this manner, FOWC has acquired all commercial rights in respect of the F1 Championship wherever such tournaments take place, i.e. with the permission of FOWC.	Facts
Jaypee was interested to acquire this right for hosting, staging and promoting the F1 Grand Prix of India event.	Facts
In order to do so, it entered into agreement with FOWC dated September 13, 2011 which is known as Race Promotion Contract (RPC).	Facts
By this agreement, FOWC granted Jaypee the right to host, stage and promote F1 Grand Prix of India event for a consideration of US 40 millions.	Facts
Another agreement known as Artwork License Agreement (ALA) was entered into between FOWC and Jaypee on the same day whereby FOWC permitted Jaypee to use certain marks and intellectual property belonging to FOWC for a consideration of US 1 million.	Facts
Prior to this RPC of 2011, another RPC of October 25, 2007 had been entered into between FOA and Jaypee which was replaced by agreement dated September 13, 2011 between FOWC and Jaypee.	Facts
Pursuant thereto, races were held in India in 2011, 2012 and 2013.	Facts
After entering into the aforesaid arrangement for hosting F1 Grand Prix in India, both FOWC and Jaypee approached AAR seeking its advance ruling on the two questions, the nature of which, including the opinion of AAR thereupon, is already mentioned above.	Facts
As pointed out earlier, first question was as to whether considerations received receivable under the RPC by FOWC from Jaypee Sports was in the nature of business income and Royalty as defined under the Act as well as DTAA.	Facts
Plea of FOWC and Jaypee was that what was granted to Jaypee by FOWC was a commercial right to use the event, i.e., a hosting right and the consideration received receivable therefrom by FOWC was not for the use of trademark, copyright, equipment etc. and hence was not in the nature of Royalty.	Facts
It was also stated by them that there was a limited permitted use of Formula One (F1) Mark which was only to enable the promoter (Jaypee) to advertise the Indian Grand Prix and reproduction of names of the sports events was routine and customary in business parlance.	Facts
For this purpose, ALA was executed to enable Jaypee to use F1 Marks in a limited way and to prevent it from using the Marks for any commercial exploitation.	Facts
Revenue had opposed the aforesaid plea of FOWC and Jaypee on the ground that the consideration comprised not only of hosting rights but also permission to use F1 Marks and, therefore, entire consideration of US 40 million was attributable to the usage of F1 Marks in terms of ALA.	Facts
According to the Revenue, RPC and ALA had to be read together for a comprehensive view of the matter, particularly, whey they were executed on the same day.	None
The AAR accepted the argument of the Revenue holding that the consideration received by FOWC amounted to royalty and was to be, accordingly, taxed under the Indian Income Act.	Facts
However, this view is reversed by the High Court by the impugned judgment after detailed discussion on this issue and in the opinion of the High Court the consideration received under the Agreement cannot be termed as royalty.	Facts
As mentioned above, Revenue has accepted the judgment of the High Court on this issue and, therefore, it is not necessary to discuss in detail the reasons given by the High Court for coming to the aforesaid conclusion.	Facts
This fact is mentioned only for the sake of completeness of the issues raised and their outcome.	Facts
The bone of contention before this Court pertains to the issue of existence of a PE of FOWC in India.	Reasoning
We may say at the outset that the arguments advanced by both the parties before us were virtually the same arguments which were advanced before the High Court as well.	Reasoning
Therefore, spelling out the submissions of the parties before the High Court may not be necessary as it would be duplicating and repetitive.	Reasoning
At this stage, we would, therefore, record the arguments which were presented before us and in the process mention the basis of the conclusion arrived at by the High Court for the purpose of forming an opinion as to whether the view of the High Court is correct and justified in law.	None
RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS DTAA REGIME Before adverting to the question at hand, it would be appropriate to take note of the scheme of the Act as well as relevant provisions of DTAA on this subject.	None
The Act provides two modes of taxation, namely, resident based and source based.	None
Any person who is a resident of India is subjected to the Act and liable to pay income tax on the total income earned by such a resident, after getting various deductions therefrom as admissible under different provisions of the Act.	None
Charging section is Section 4 which, inter alia, stipulates that income tax shall be charged for any Assessment Year in respect of total income of the previous year of every of such person.	None
Section 5 contains the scope of total income of a resident and includes all income from whatever source derived by a person who is resident which is received or deemed to be received in India, accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India or accrues or arises to him outside India during such year.	None
Thus, a resident is supposed to pay income tax on all incomes so earned whether in India or outside India.	None
On the other hand, those persons who are not ordinarily residents of India (which term is defined under subsection (6) of Section 6) are not liable to pay income tax on any income which accrues or arises to such nonresident outside India.	None
However, in the case of nonresident persons, if the income is derived from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India, these nonresidents are subjected to pay tax for such an income earned in India.	None
In their case, all such incomes from whatever source derived which is received or is deemed to be received in India in such a year by or on behalf of such person or accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to them in India during that year, is taxable in India.	None
In this sense, the income tax on nonresident is source based, i.e., source of such income is India and, therefore, even a nonresident is liable to pay tax on incomes earned in India.	None
Resident in India and Notordinarily Resident in India are covered by the provisions contained in Section 6.	None
In the present case, we are concerned with the consideration received by FOWC as a result of Agreement signed with Jaypee Sports.	Reasoning
FOWC, being a UK Company, is admittedly the nonresident in India.	Reasoning
Since the question is whether the aforesaid consideration income earned by FOWC is subject to tax in India or not, it is to be decided as to whether that income accrued or arose in India.	None
For this purpose, relevant provision is Section 9 of the Act.	None
This section contains varied situations where income is deemed to accrue or arise in India and it is not necessary to spell out each of such contingencies.	None
Insofar as income by way of royalty earned by a nonresident is concerned, that is mentioned in clause (vi) of Section 9(1) of the Act.	None
As the consideration of US 40 million received by FOWC from Jaypee is held as no income by way of royalty, we may conveniently skip that provision.	None
Clause (i) of subsection (1) of Section 9 of the Act mentions certain kinds of income which are deemed to accrue or arise in India.	None
This clause is reproduced below all income accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, through or from any business connection in India, or through or from any property in India, or through or from any asset or source of income in India, or through the transfer of a capital asset situate in India It is clear from the reading of the said clause that it includes all those incomes, whether directly or indirectly, which are accruing or arising through or from any business connection in India.	Reasoning
It is, thus, clear that an income which is earned directly or indirectly, i.e. even indirectly, is to be deemed to accrue or earned in India.	Reasoning
Further, such an income should have some business connection in India.	Reasoning
Explanation (1) for the purpose of this clause provides five explanations from clauses (a) to (e).	Reasoning
Clause (a) stipulates that where all the business operations are not carried in India and only some such operations of business are carried in India, the income of the business deemed under this clause to accrue or arise in India shall be only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the operations carried in India.	Reasoning
We are not concerned with clauses (b) to (e).	Reasoning
Explanation (2) provides certain exceptions in respect of business connection and reads as under Explanation 2.  	None
For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that business connection shall include any business activity carried out through a person who, acting on behalf of the nonresident,  (a) has and habitually exercises in India, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the nonresident, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of gods or merchandise for the nonresident or (b) has no such authority, but habitually maintains in India a stock of gods or merchandise from which he regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of the nonresident or (c) habitually secures orders in India, mainly or wholly for the nonresident or for that nonresident and other nonresidents controlling, controlled by, or subject to the same common control, as that nonresident Provided that such business connection shall not include any business activity carried out through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent having an independent status, if such broker, general commission agent or any other agent having an independent status is acting in the ordinary course of his business Provided further that where such broker, general commission agent or any other agent works mainly or wholly on behalf of a nonresident (hereafter in this proviso referred to as the principal nonresident) or on behalf of such nonresident and other nonresidents which are controlled by the principal nonresident or have a controlling interest in the principal nonresident or are subject to the same common control as the principal nonresident, he shall not be deemed to be a broker, general commission agent or an agent of an independent status.	None
This exception, thus, clarifies and declares that even when business activity is carried through a person who is acting on behalf of the nonresident (which means agent of the nonresident), it will be treated that the nonresident is having business connection in India.	Reasoning
The meaning of the expression through is again clarified in Explanation (4), which reads as under Explanation 4.  	Arguments of Respondent
For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the expression through shall mean and include and shall be deemed to have always meant and included by means of, in consequence of or by reason of.	Arguments of Respondent
If a nonresident has a PE in India, then business connection in India stands established.	Reasoning
Section 92F of the Act contains definitions of certain terms, though those definitions have relevance for the purposes of computation of arms length price, etc. Clause (3) thereof defines enterprise and such an enterprise includes a PE of a person.	None
PE is defined in clause (iiia) in the following manner (iiia) permanent establishment, referred to in clause (iii), includes a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on At this juncture, we would also like to point out that Article 5 of DTAA between India and United Kingdom lays down as to what would constitute a PE.	None
It reads as under ARTICLE 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT For the purposes of this Convention, the term permanent establishment means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.	None
The term permanent establishment shall include especially (a) a place of management (b) a branch (c) an office (d) a factory (e) a workshop (f) premises used as a sales outlet or for receiving or soliciting orders (g) a warehouse in relation to a person providing store facilities for others (h) a mine, an oil or gas well, quarry on other place of extraction of natural resources an installation or structure used for the exploration or exploitation of natural resources (j) a building site or construction, installation or assembly project or supervisory activities in connection therewith, where such site, project or supervisory activity continues for a period of more than six months, or where such project or supervisory activity, being incidental to the sale or machinery or equipment, continues for a period not exceeding six months and the charges payable for the project or supervisory activity exceed 10 per cent of the sale price of the machinery and equipment (k) the furnishing of services including managerial services, other than those taxable under Article 13 (Royalties and fees for technical services), within a Contracting State by an enterprise through employees or other personnel, but only if activities of that nature continue within that State for a period or periods aggregating more than 90 days within any twelvemonth period or services are performed within that State for an enterprise within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article 10 (Associated enterprises) and continue for a period or periods aggregating more than 30 days within any twelvemonth period Provided that for the purposes of this paragraph an enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if it provides services or facilities in connection with, or supplies plant and machinery on hire used or to be used in, the prospecting for, or extraction or production of mineral oils in that State.	None
The term permanent establishment shall not be deemed to include (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage or display of gods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage or display (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise, or for collecting information, for the enterprise (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of advertising, for the supply of information or for scientific research, being activities solely of a preparatory or auxiliary character in the trade of business of the enterprise.	None
However, this provision shall not be applicable where the enterprise maintains any other fixed place of business in the other Contracting State for any purpose or purposes other than the purposes specified in this paragraph (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of businesses solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e) of the paragraph, provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.	None
A person acting in a Contracting State for or on behalf of an enterprise of the other contracting State  other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph (5) of this Article applies, shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment of that enterprise in the first mentioned State if (a) he has, and habitually exercises in that State, an authority to negotiate and enter into contracts for or on behalf of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of gods or merchandise for the enterprise or (b) he habitually maintains in the firstmentioned Contracting State a stock of gods or merchandise from which he regularly delivers goods or merchandise for or on behalf of the enterprise or (c) he habitually secures orders in the firstmentioned State, wholly or almost wholly for the enterprise itself or for the enterprise and the enterprises controlling, controlled by, or subject to the same common control, as that enterprise.	None
An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, where such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.	None
However, if the activities of such an agent are carried out wholly or almost wholly for the enterprise (or for the enterprise and other enterprises which are controlled by it or have a controlling interest in it or are subject to same common control)	None
he shall not be considered to be an agent of an independent status for the purposes of this paragraph.	None
The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.	None
For the purposes of this Article the term control, in relation to a company, means the ability to exercise control over the companys affairs by means of the direct or indirect holding of the greater part of the issued share capital or voting power in the company.	None
As per subclause (1) of Article 5, a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on, is known as permanent establishment.	None
It requires that there has to be a fixed place of business.	None
It also requires that from such a place business of an enterprise (FOWC in the instant case) is carried on, whether wholly or partly.	None
Subclause (2) gives the illustrations of certain places which will be treated as PEs.	None
Likewise, subclause (3) excludes certain kinds of places from the term PE.	None
Subclause (4) enumerates the circumstances under which a person is to be treated as acting on behalf of nonresident enterprise.	None
Likewise, subclause (5) excludes certain kinds of agents of enterprise, namely, broker, general commission agent or agent of an independent status, by clarifying that if the business is carried on through these persons, the enterprise shall not be deemed to be a PE.	None
However, one exception thereto is carved out, namely, if the activities of such an agent are carried out wholly or almost wholly for the enterprise, or for the enterprise and other enterprises which are controlled by it or have a controlling interest in it or are subject to same common control, then, such an agent will be treated as an agent of an independent status.	None
It means that if the business is carried out with such a kind of agent, the enterprise will be deemed to have a PE in India.	None
THE LEGAL COMMENTARIES AND CASE LAW It is an undisputed fact that Article 5 of DTAA between India and the United Kingdom follows the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developments (OECD) Model of Double Taxation Convention.	None
There are various commentaries on Double Taxation Conventions.	None
Celebrated among those are A Manual on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital by Philip Baker Q.C., and Klaus Vogel on Double Taxation Conventions.	None
OECD has also given its condensed version on Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital.	None
What constitutes PE under various circumstances has also been the subject matter of judicial verdicts in India as well as in other countries.	None
For better understanding of what may constitute a PE, it would be imperative to refer to these commentaries and judicial decisions.	None
This discussion would disclose the principles enunciated to determine the existence of a PE, application whereof to the given facts would facilitate in answering the surging debate.	None
Philip Baker explains that the concept of PE is important for several Articles of the Conventions the concept, or its cognate, also appears in the domestic law of some countries.	None
According to him, the concept marks the dividing line for businesses between merely trading with a country and trading in that country if an enterprise has a PE, its presence in a country is sufficiently substantial that it is trading in the country.	None
He has quoted the following passage from the judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, authored by Justice (Retd.)	None
Jagannadha Rao (as His Lordships then was, later Judge of this Court) in Commissioner of Income Tax, A.P.I v. Visakhapatnam Port Trust, (1983)	None
144 ITR 146	None
The words permanent establishment postulate the existence of a substantial element of an enduring or permanent nature of a foreign enterprise in another country which can be attributed to a fixed place of business in that country.	None
It should be of such a nature that it would amount to a virtual projection of the foreign enterprise of one country into the soil of another country.	None
Emphasising that as a creature of international tax law, the concept of PE has a particularly strong claim to a uniform international meaning, Philip Baker discerns two types of PEs contemplated under Article 5 of OECD Model.	None
First, an establishment which is part of the same enterprise under common ownership and control  an office, branch, etc., to which he gives his own description as an associated permanent establishment.	None
The second type is an agent, though legally separate from the enterprise, nevertheless who is dependent on the enterprise to the point of forming a PE.	None
Such PE is given the nomenclature of unassociated permanent establishment by Baker.	None
He, however, pointed out that there is a possibility of a third type of PE, i.e. a construction or installation site may be regarded as PE under certain circumstances.	None
In the first type of PE, i.e. associated permanent establishments, primary requirement is that there must be a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.	None
It entails two requirements which need to be fulfilled (a) there must be a business of an enterprise of a Contracting State (FOWC in the instant case) and (b) PE must be a fixed place of business, i.e. a place which is at the disposal of the enterprise.	None
It is universally accepted that for ascertaining whether there is a fixed place or not, PE must have three characteristics stability, productivity and dependence.	None
Further, fixed place of business connotes existence of a physical location which is at the disposal of the enterprise through which the business is carried on.	None
Some of the examples of fixed place of business given by Baker are the following The place of business must be fixed and permanent.	None
Thus, a shed which had been rented for thirteen years for storing and preparing hides was held to constitute a PE (Transvaal Associated Hide Skin Merchants (Pty) Ltd. (1967) 29 S.A.T.C. 97 (Court of Appeal, Botswana).).	None
Similarly, a writers study has been held to constitute a PE (Georges Simenon (1965) 44 T.C. (US) 820 (US Tax Court)).	None
A stand at a trade fair, occupied regularly for three weeks a year, through which the enterprise obtained contracts for a significant part of its annual sales, has also been held to constitute a PE (Joseph Fowler v. M.N.R. (1990) 90 D.T.C. 1834 (1990) 2 C.T.C. 2351 (Tax Court of Canada)).	Reasoning
A temporary restaurant operated in a mirror tent at a Dutch flower show for a period of seven months was held to constitute a PE (Antwerp Court of Appeal, decision of February 6, 2001, noted in 2001 WTD 10611).	Reasoning
An office, workshop and storeroom for the maintenance of aircraft, which were leased out by the enterprise, has been held to constitute a PE (Income Tax Appeals Nos. 759/KB to 761/KB of 199798 (Tarom SA), (1998)	None
PTD (Trib.)	None
3749 (Incometax Appellate Tribunal, Pakistan)).	None
On the other hand, possession of a mailing address in a state  without an office, telephone listing or bank account  has been held not to constitute a PE (Consolidated Premium Iron Ores Ltd. (1959) 265 F 2d. 320).	None
The mere supply of skilled labour to work in a country did not give rise to a PE of the company supplying the labour (Tekniskil (Sendirian) Bhd.	None
v. Commissioner of Income Tax, (1996) 222 I.T.R. 551 (Authority for Advance Rulings, India)).	None
A drilling rig which, although anchored while in operation, was moved to a new site every few months, has been held not to constitute a PE (Lower Tax Court of the Hague, September 10, 1990, noted in (1991) Tax Notes Intl.	None
161).	None
Similarly, a remotely operated vessel which was used to inspect and repair submarine pipelines was held not to constitute a PE because a moving vessel is not a fixed place of business (Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax v. Subsea Offshore Ltd. (1998)	None
66 I.T.D. 296 (Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai), noted in 17 Tax Notes Intl. 1795).	None
The principal test, in order to ascertain as to whether an establishment has a fixed place of business or not, is that such physically located premises have to be at the disposal of the enterprise.	None
For this purpose, it is not necessary that the premises are owned or even rented by the enterprise.	Reasoning
It will be sufficient if the premises are put at the disposal of the enterprise.	Reasoning
However, merely giving access to such a place to the enterprise for the purposes of the project would not suffice.	Reasoning
The place would be treated as at the disposal of the enterprise when the enterprise has right to use the said place and has control thereupon.	Reasoning
Some of the illustrative cases decided by courts of different jurisdictions given by Baker in his commentary are contained in the following passages from that book In the Canadian case of William Dudney v. R, (1999) 99	None
DTC 147, the taxpayer was a resident of the United States who was contracted to supply training to employees of a Canadian company.	None
For the purposes of the training contract, the taxpayer was given various offices at the premises of the Canadian company, which he was only allowed to enter at normal office hours.	None
He was allowed to use the clients telephone only on clients business.	None
He spent 300 days in one tax year and 40 in the subsequent year at the premises.	None
The Tax Court of Canada and the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed that he had no fixed base  which was treated as having the same meaning as PE  at the premises since he had no right to use the premises as the base for the operation of his own business.	None
In a case generally referred to as Hotel Manager (Bundersfinanzhof, February 3, 1993, IR 8081/91, IStR 1993, p. 226, (1993) BStBl., II, 462.), the Bundesfinanzhof held that a UK hotel management company had a PE in Germany when it entered into a 20 year contract with a limited partnership which owned a hotel.	None
The agreement required the UK company to supply a general manager the general managers office constituted the PE (and not the entire hotel) since the UK company had a secured right to use this office for the purposes of the agreement.	None
A Swiss company was held not to have a PE when it contracted with a German company to produce salad dressings in the name of and in accordance with the recipe of the Swiss company.	None
No employees of the Swiss company were present at the production facility to supervise production (Decision of the Lower Tax Court of BadenWurttemberg, May 11, 1992, decision No. 3K 309/91, RIW 1993, 81, IStR 1992, p. 104).	None
The Bundestinanzhof has also held that a scene painter who was commissioned to carry out a work in France for six weeks, and given special rooms for the purpose, did not have a fixed base at those premises.	None
The Administrative Court of Appeal of Paris has held that a German travel agency did not have a PE in France (Decision of November 10, 1998, (199) Revue de Droit Fiscal, No. 25, comm 503, reported with translation in (1998) 1 ITLR 857).	None
A travel agency in Paris had made an office available to the German company from time to time, and the manager of the German company had a flat in Paris the Court held that the German company had no PE at its disposal in France.	None
The Brussels Court of Appeal has held that a German resident engaged in the transportation of vehicles had a PE in Belgium (Cour de Cassation of February 15, 1980 (1980) J1.	None
De Droit Fiscal 321.).	None
The taxpayer had an office 3m by 6m at his disposal on the premises of his principal supplier in Belgium, together with telephone and telex, where the taxpayer and four of his staff worked.	None
According to Philip Baker, the aforesaid illustrations confirm that the fixed place of business need not be owned or leased by the foreign enterprise, provided that is at the disposal of the enterprise in the sense of having some right to use the premises for the purposes of its business and not solely for the purposes of the project undertaken on behalf of the owner of the premises.	None
Interpreting the OECD Article 5 pertaining to PE, Klaus Vogel has remarked that insofar as the term business is concerned, it is broad, vague and of little relevance for the PE definition.	None
According to him, the crucial element is the term place.	None
Importance of the term place is explained by him in the following manner In conjunction with the attribute fixed, the requirement of a place reflects the strong link between the land and the taxing powers of the State.	None
This territorial link serves as the basis not only for the distributive rules which are tied to the existence of PE but also for a considerable number of other distributive rules and, above all, for the assignment of a person to either Contracting State on the basis of residence (Article 1, read in conjunction with Article 4 OECD and UN MC).	None
We would also like to extract below the definition to the expression place by Vogel, which is as under A place is a certain amount of space within the soil or on the soil.	None
This understanding of place as a threedimensional zone rather than a single point on the earth can be derived from the French Version (installation fixe) as well as the term establishment.	None
As a rule, this zone is based on a certain area in, on, or above the surface of the earth.	None
Rooms or technical equipment above the soil may quality as a PE only if they are fixed on the soil.	None
This requirement, however, stems from the term fixed rather than the term place, given that a place (or space) does not necessarily consist of a piece of land.	None
On the contrary, the term establishment makes clear that it is not the soil as such which is the PE but that the PE is constituted by a tangible facility as distinct from the soil.	None
This is particularly evident from the French version of Article 5(1)	None
OECD MC which uses the term installation instead of place.	None
The term place is used to define the term establishment.	None
Therefore, place includes all tangible assets used for carrying on the business, but one such tangible asset can be sufficient.	None
The characterization of such assets under private law as real property rather than personal property (in common law countries) or immovable rather than movable property (in civil law countries) is not authoritative.	None
It is rather the context (including, above all, the terms fixed fixe), as well as the object and purpose of Article 5 OECD and UN MC itself, in the light of which the term place needs to be interpreted.	None
This approach, which follows from the general rules on treaty interpretation, gives a certain leeway for including movable property in the understanding of place and, therefore, the assume a PE once such property has been fixed to the soil.	None
For example, a work bench in a caravan, restaurants on permanently anchored river boats, steady oil rigs, or a transformator or generator on board a former railway wagon qualify as places (and may also be fixed).	None
In contrast, purely intangible property cannot qualify in any case.	None
In particular, rights such a participations in a corporation, claims, bundles of claims (like bank accounts), any other type of intangible property (patents, software, trademarks etc.) or intangible economic assets (a regular clientele or the goodwill of an enterprise) do not in themselves constitute a PE.	None
They can only form part of PE constituted otherwise.	None
Likewise, an internet website (being a combination of software and other electronic data) does not constitute tangible property and, therefore, does not constitute a PE.	None
Neither does the mere incorporation of a company in a Contracting State in itself constitute a PE of the company in that State.	None
Where a company has its seat, according to its bylaws and or registration, in State A while the POEM is situated in State B, this company will usually be liable to tax on the basis of its worldwide income in both Contracting States under their respective domestic tax law.	None
Under the AB treaty, however, the company will be regarded as a resident of State B only (Article 4(3) OECD and UN MC).	None
In the absence of both actual facilities and a dependent agent in State A, income of this company will be taxable only in State B under the 1st sentence of Article 7(1) OECD and UN MC.	None
There is no minimum size of the piece of land.	None
Where the qualifying business activities consist (in full or in part) of human activities by the taxpayer, his employees or representatives, the mere space needed for the physical presence of these individuals is not sufficient (if it were sufficient, Article 5(5)	None
OECD MC and Article 5(5)(a)	None
UN MC and the notion of agent PEs were superfluous).	None
This can be illustrated by the example of a salesman who regularly visits a major customer to take orders, and conducts meetings in the purchasing directors office.	None
The OECD MC Comm. has convincingly denied the existence of a PE, based on the implicit understanding that the relevant geographical unit is not just the chair where the salesman sits, but the entire office of the customer, and the office is not at the disposal of the enterprise for which the salesman is working.	None
Taking cue from the word through in the Article, Vogel has also emphasised that the place of business qualifies only if the place is at the disposal of the enterprise.	None
According to him, the enterprise will not be able to use the place of business as an instrument for carrying on its business unless it controls the place of business to a considerable extent.	None
He hastens to add that there are no absolute standards for the modalities and intensity of control.	None
Rather, the standards depend on the type of business activity at issue.	None
According to him, disposal is the power (or a certain fraction thereof) to use the place of business directly.	None
Some of the instances given by Vogel in this behalf, of relative standards of control, are as under The degree of control depends on the type of business activity that the taxpayer carries on.	None
It is therefore not necessary that the taxpayer is able to exclude others from entering or using the POB.	None
The painter example in the OECD MC Comm.	None
(no. 4.5	None
OECD MC Comm.	None
on Article 5) (however questionable it might be with regard to the functional integration test) suggests that the type and extent of control need not exceed the level of what is required for the specific type of activity which is determined by the concrete business.	None
By contrast, in the case of a selfemployed engineer who had free access to his customers premises to perform the services required by his contract, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the engineer had no control because he had access only during the customers regular office hours and was not entitled to carry on businesses of his own on the premises.	None
Similarly, a Special Bench of Delhis Income Tax Appellate Tribunal denied the existence of a PE in the case of Ericsson.	None
The Tribunal held that it was not sufficient that Ericssons employees had access to the premises of Indian mobile phone providers to deliver the hardware, software and knowhow required for operating a network.	None
By contrast, in the case of a competing enterprise, the Bench did assume an Indian PE because the employees of that enterprise (unlike Ericssons) had exercised other businesses of their employer.	None
The OECD view can hardly be reconciled with the two court cases.	None
All three examples do indeed shed some light onto the method how the relative standards for the control threshold should be designed.	None
While the OECD MC Comm. suggests that it is sufficient to require not more than the type and extent of control necessary for the specific business activity which the taxpayer wants to exercise in the source State, the Canadian and Indian decisions advocate for stricter standards for the control threshold.	None
The OECD MC shows a paramount tendency (though no strict rule) that PEs should be treated like subsidiaries (cf.	None
Article 24(3) OECD and UN MC), and that facilities of a subsidiary would rarely been unusable outside the office hours of one of its customers (i.e. a third person), the view of the two courts is still more convincing.	None
Along these lines, a POB will usually exist only where the taxpayer is free to use the POB  at any time of his own choice  for work relating to more than one customer and  for his internal administrative and bureaucratic work.	None
In all, the taxpayer will usually be regarded as controlling the POB only where he can employ it at his discretion.	None
This does not imply that the standards of the control test should not be flexible and adaptive.	None
Generally, the less invasive the activities are, and the more they allow a parallel use of the same POB by other persons, the lower are the requirements under the control test.	None
There are, however, a number of traditional PEs which by their nature require an exclusive use of the POB by only one taxpayer and or his personnel.	None
A small workshop (cf. Article 5(2)(e) OECD and UN MC) of 10 or 12 square meters can hardly be used by more than one person.	None
The same holds true for a room where the taxpayer runs a noisy machine.	None
OECD commentary on Model Tax Convention mentions that a general definition of the term PE brings out its essential characteristics, i.e. a distinct situs, a fixed place of business.	None
This definition, therefore, contains the following conditions  the existence of a place of business, i.e. a facility such as premises or, in certain instances, machinery or equipment.  	None
this place of business must be fixed, i.e. it must be established at a distinct place with a certain degree of permanence  the carrying on of the business of the enterprise through this fixed place of business.	None
This means usually that persons who, in one way or another, are dependent on the enterprise (personnel) conduct the business of the enterprise in the State in which the fixed place is situated.	None
The term place of business is explained as covering any premises, facilities or installations used for carrying on the business of the enterprise whether or not they are used exclusively for that purpose.	None
It is clarified that a place of business may also exist where no premises are available or required for carrying on the business of the enterprise and it simply has a certain amount of space at its disposal.	None
Further, it is immaterial whether the premises, facilities or installations are owned or rented by or are otherwise at the disposal of the enterprise.	None
A certain amount of space at the disposal of the enterprise which is used for business activities is sufficient to constitute a place of business.	None
No formal legal right to use that place is required.	None
Thus, where an enterprise illegally occupies a certain location where it carries on its business, that would also constitute a PE.	None
Some of the examples where premises are treated at the disposal of the enterprise and, therefore, constitute PE are a place of business may thus be constituted by a pitch in a market place, or by a certain permanently used area in a customs depot (e.g. for the storage of dutiable goods).	None
Again the place of business may be situated in the business facilities of another enterprise.	None
This may be the case for instance where the foreign enterprise has at its constant disposal certain premises or a part thereof owned by the other enterprise.	None
At the same time, it is also clarified that the mere presence of an enterprise at a particular location does not necessarily mean that the location is at the disposal of that enterprise.	None
The OECD commentary gives as many as four examples where location will not be treated at the disposal of the enterprise.	None
These are The first example is that of a salesman who regularly visits a major customer to take orders and meets the purchasing director in his office to do so.	None
In that case, the customers premises are not at the disposal of the enterprise for which the salesman is working and therefore do not constitute a fixed place of business through which the business of that enterprise is carried on (depending on the circumstances, however, paragraph 5 could apply to deem a permanent establishment to exist).	None
Second example is that of an employee of a company who, for a long period of time, is allowed to use an office in the headquarters of another company (e.g. a newly acquired subsidiary) in order to ensure that the latter company complies with its obligations under contracts concluded with the former company.	None
In that case, the employee is carrying on activities related to the business of the former company and the office that is at his disposal at the headquarters of the other company will constitute a permanent establishment of his employer, provided that the office is at his disposal for a sufficiently long period of time so as to constitute a fixed place of business (see paragraphs 6 to 6.3) and that the activities that are performed there go beyond the activities referred to in paragraph 4 of the Article.	None
The third example is that of a road transportation enterprise which would use a delivery dock at a customers warehouse every day for a number of years for the purpose of delivering goods purchased by that customer.	None
In that case, the presence of the road transportation enterprise at the delivery dock would be so limited that that enterprise could not consider that place as being at its disposal so as to constitute a permanent establishment of that enterprise.	None
Fourth example is that of a painter, who, for two years, spends three days a week in the large office building of its main client.	None
In that case, the presence of the painter in that office building where he is performing the most important functions of his business (i.e. painting) constitute a permanent establishment of that painter.	None
It also states that the words through which must be given a wide meaning so as to apply to any situation where business activities are carried on at a particular location which is at the disposal of the enterprise for that purpose.	None
For this reason, an enterprise engaged in paving a road will be considered to be carrying on its business through the location where this activity takes place.	None
THE AGREEMENTS Having got a fair idea of what would constitute a PE, we may advert to the discussion in that part of the impugned judgment where the High Court has given its reasons to conclude that FOWC had a PE in India in the relevant Assessment Year.	Reasoning
However, before that, it would be necessary to refer to the salient provisions of the relevant agreements between the parties, not only between FOWC and Jaypee, but some agreements which were entered into by the group companies of FOWC with Jaypee.	Reasoning
We have already mentioned above that there is an Agreement between FIA and FOAM which is dated April 24, 2001 whereby FIA has parted with the commercial rights in favour of FOAM making FOAM exclusive CRH.	Reasoning
Thereafter, vide the aforesaid agreement FOAM transferred the commercial rights in favour of FOWC with effect from 2011 for a period of 10 years.	Reasoning
Insofar as Concorde Agreement which is signed between FIA, FOWC and teams is concerned, that is of the year 2009.	Reasoning
It is relevant to mention that before RPC dated September 13, 2011 was entered into between FOWC and Jaypee, one Organisation Agreement (OA) dated January 20, 2011 was signed between FIA FMSCI and Jaypee.	Reasoning
As per this agreement, Jaypee was to organise the event.	Reasoning
Thereafter, another agreement known as Title Sponsorship Agreement dated August 16, 2011 was signed between Beta Prema 2 (an associated company of FOWC) and Bharti Airtel, as per which Beta Prema 2 transferred title sponsorship rights to Bharti Airtel for US 8 million in respect of the race which was conducted on October 29, 2011.	Reasoning
It is thereafter that RPC dated September 13, 2011 was signed by FOWC and Jaypee.	Reasoning
That was one month before the scheduled date of race, which was fixed as October 29, 2011.	Reasoning
Under this agreement, right to host, stage and promote the event was given to Jaypee by FOWC.	Reasoning
As per the Revenue, FOWC carried on business in India through a fixed place of business, namely, the Buddh International Circuit.	Reasoning
Salient features of this Agreement, which is the most vital document, are as follows WHEREAS The Federation Internationale de lAutomobile (FIA) is the governing body of world motor sport.	None

Prevent the lawful transmission of Images or Recordings of the Events or any part of it in any country.	None
JUDGMENT OF THE HIGH COURT	None
Taking note of this agreement, the High Court went ahead to decide the following aspects, which revolved around the question of PE Whether FOWC had control over the Buddh International Circuit and that the circuit could be constituted as a fixed place of business?	None
Whether FOWC carried on business?	None
IF so, they did carry on business and commercial activity in India.	None
Whether FOWC carried on business through its agents under Article 5(4) or Article 5(5) of the DTAA?	None
Answering the first question, the High Court discerned that for the duration of the event as well as two weeks prior to it and a week succeeding it, FOWC had full access through its personnel, the team contracted to it, both racing as well as spectator teams to the said Buddh International Circuit.	None
It could also dictate who was authorised to enter the areas reserved for it.	None
As per the High Court, though Jaypee was designated as the promoter or the host of the event in terms of RPC, when the matter was to be examined in a correct perspective by seeking through the other terms contained in the agreement as well as terms of agreements between JP and Allsports, Beta Prema 2 as well as FOA, it was clear that Jaypees capacity to act was extremely restricted.	None
At all material times, FOWC had exclusive access to the circuit and all the places where the teams were located.	None
The High Court was also conscious of the fact that such an access or right to access was not permanent in the sense of its being everlasting.	None
However, having regard to the model of commercial transactions, such an access for a period up to six weeks at a time during the F1 Championship season was sufficient for the purposes of Article 5(1) of DTAA.	None
Further, as the tenure of RPC was five years, it meant that such an access for the period in question was of repetitive nature.	None
Moreover, FOWC was entitled to two years payment of the assured consideration of US 40 million in the event of termination of RPC.	None
While discussing the second question, the High Court took note of agreement between FIA and FOWC under which FOWC became CRH.	None
It also pointed out that the Concorde Agreement assured the participating teams that the FIA had exclusive rights in the F1 Championship and was entitled to the grant of CRH, the exclusive right to exploit the commercial rights in the F1 Championship.	None
Subject to these conditions, each team undertook to participate in the FIA F1 Championship each year for several events and make cars available.	None
In fact, every team undertook to participate in each event with two cars.	None
Taking note of the aforesaid arrangement and other clauses of these agreements, the High Court concluded that FOWC carried on business in India within the meaning of expression under Article 5(1) of the DTAA.	None
The High Court was conscious of the fact that after its finding to the effect that FOWC had PE in India, the issue as to whether FOWC carried on business through its agents or not, became academic.	None
Notwithstanding the same, it chose to discuss that issue as well so that the judgment had the coverage of all the questions that had arisen before it.	None
This aspect has been discussed in the light of subarticles (4) and (5) of Article 5 of DTAA.	None
It is pertinent to mention that argument of the Revenue was that since FOWC had to exploit commercial rights arising from races and this business is carried on through exploitation of these commercial rights either by itself or through anyone or more members of CRH group, as mentioned in the Conorde Agreement, FOWC is obliged to propose consolidated accounts incorporating profits of all entities forming part of CRH group.	None
The Revenue had relied on the Events right from the time when commercial rights were originally owned by FIA and thereafter transferred to SLEC Holding Company (parent company of FOWC) for a consideration, then given to FOAM and with effect from January 01, 2011 transferred to FOWC.	None
It was also pointed out that FOWCs three affiliates, i.e. Formula One Management Ltd. (FOM), Allsports Management SA and Beta Prema 2 Ltd. were its agents who carried on its business and on its behalf, through the fixed place.	None
AAR had rejected this submission of the Revenue holding that the theory of Revenue that all the three entities were acting on behalf of FOWC was unfounded as there was no evidence to this effect and all arrangements and agreements in relation to activities performed by three entities were sham.	None
The High Court approved the aforesaid approach of AAR in the following manner Article 5(5) has certain preconditions if an entity has to be treated as dependent agent.	None
The agent must have the authority to conclude contracts, which bind the represented enterprise, and it must habitually exercise such authority.	None
If these positive preconditions are met, then only an enterprise shall be deemed to have a PE in that state in respect of any activities, which that person undertakes for the enterprise.	None
The contention that because the three entities were subsidiaries of FOWC, they acted on its behalf and thus become dependent agents is insubstantial.	None
The mere circumstance that the three subsidiaries had a connection with FOWC was not enough what is to be shown is that the contracts they entered into and the businesses they were engaged in, was for and on behalf of FOWC.	None
Each of the three agreements independently entered into by them with Jaypee contains no pointers to this fact.	None
THE ARGUMENTS Mr. Ganesh, opened the case of FOWC, whereafter M s. Arvind P. Datar and Dushant Dave, learned senior advocates, made their submissions on behalf of Jaypee.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney General for India, argued on behalf of the Revenue and countered those submissions.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also argued the appeal of Union of India insofar as it challenges the findings of the High Court interpreting Article 5(4) and (5) and holding that the other companies of FOWC group did not act as agents of FOWC in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
M s. S. Ganesh and Arvind P. Datar made their submissions in rejoinder and also refuted the arguments of Mr. Mukul Rohatgi advanced in the appeal of Union of India, to which Mr. Rohatgi made his submissions in rejoinder.	Arguments of Petitioner
45.	Arguments of Petitioner
After referring to the important dates and events, Article 5 of DTAA and the commentaries of OECD, Philip Baker and Klaus Vogel thereon, salient features whereof have already been reproduced by us, emphasis in the submission of Mr. Ganesh was that in order to constitute a PE, condition which was necessary to satisfy was that the particular fixed place is at the disposal of FOWC and further that from the said fixed place FOWC was doing its business activity.	Arguments of Petitioner
Submission of Mr. Ganesh was that both the ingredients were missing in the instant case.	Arguments of Petitioner
For this purpose, he referred to the agreement of 2009 which was entered into between FIA and Jaypee and pointed out that FOWC was not party to the said agreement and contended that this agreement clearly evinced that it is the FIA which had control over the manner in which the Championship was to be conducted.	Arguments of Petitioner
This agreement further reflected that it is Jaypee who was responsible for conducting races and had complete control of the Event in question.	Arguments of Petitioner
All obligations for conduct of the Championship were to be discharged by Jaypee as organisers.	Arguments of Petitioner
For this purpose, he referred to the counter affidavit filed by Jaypee in SLP(Civil)	Arguments of Petitioner
No. 3112 of 2017 wherein the role of Jaypee in organising these Events is stated.	Arguments of Petitioner
From there, it was pointed out that the track was constructed by Jaypee for this purpose they had their own engineers, architects etc. entire expenditure for this purpose was borne by Jaypee.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also stated that this circuit was owned by Jaypee and control thereon was that of Jaypee on which not only Championship in question was organised, but Jaypee was utilising this track for many other events which are organised on regular basis, all year round.	Arguments of Petitioner
46.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Ganesh also drew the attention of this Court to Organisation Agreement dated January 20, 2011 signed between FIA, Jaypee and Federation of Motors Sports Clubs of India wherein Jaypee is described as the Organiser and given the responsibility to organise the Event.	Arguments of Petitioner
It specifically delineates various responsibilities of Jaypee as organisers which have already been taken note of above.	Arguments of Petitioner
In nutshell, he submitted that right from construction laying down the contract for the motor races people till the conclusion of the Events Championship, all acts and obligations were to be performed by Jaypee, with no role of FOWC therein.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, in contrast, it could be seen from the Agreement dated September 13, 2011 between FOWC and Jaypee that FOWC had simply given permission to host the Event as a round of the Championship, since it is the FOWC, who has the exclusive right to exploit the commercial rights in the Championship, including exclusive right to propose the Championship calendar.	Arguments of Petitioner
Condition precedent from entering into this Agreement, as mentioned in the Agreement itself, was that Jaypee (as promoter) had entered into a valid and binding agreement with such third party in accordance with Clause 18.3 (Service Agreement).	Arguments of Petitioner
Referring to the clause pertaining to obligations and warranties of FOWC, Mr. Ganesh submitted that the role of FOWC was primarily that of advising, assisting and consulting with the promoter in relation to the Event in such manner as FOWC shall consider necessary and or appropriate for the staging and promotion of the Event to the mutual benefit of the parties.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Jaypee was given exclusive right to act as the promoter of the Event, to construct the circuit which was to be laid out and prepared in accordance with that agreement in a form and manner approved both by FOWC and FIA.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, construction was to be carried out by Jaypee albeit, in the form and the manner approved by FOWC and FIA to ensure that the track meets all requirements of the Regulations.	Arguments of Petitioner
Otherwise, all those rights which were necessary for the purposes of hosting and staging the Event at the circuit were that of Jaypee exclusively.	Arguments of Petitioner
47.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the basis of the aforesaid documents and clauses and terms therein, Mr. Ganesh submitted that the circuit was not under the control or at the disposal of FOWC.	Arguments of Petitioner
As regards 4500 seats in paddock space given to FOWC in that circuit is concerned, explanation of Mr. Ganesh was that it is Allsports which was incharge of paddock and the same was taken from Allsports by FOWC in the year 2006 and, therefore, it would not make any difference.	Arguments of Petitioner
48.	Arguments of Petitioner
His further submission was that no business was conducted by the FOWC from the said site as well.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, since FOWC was commercial rights holder of these events, main business of FOWC was to exploit these rights.	Arguments of Petitioner
including intellectual property rights.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, the exploitation of these commercial rights yields two revenue streams  first, the consideration received from the Promoter Organizer of the Event, to whom FOWC has granted the necessary right to host, stage and promote the Event secondly, FOWC exploits the TV feed in respect of the Event, which is made available to it by the Promoter Organiser, at his cost.	Arguments of Petitioner
FOWC grants screening, exhibition, telecasting and media rights arising out of and relating to this TV feed to a number of parties around the world, by entering into contracts with them at London.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is for this reason that insofar as holding of the Event is concerned, FOWC was not responsible therefor and for this reason it was necessary for Jaypee as promoter to enter into a valid and binding agreement with a third party (FIA in the present case).	Arguments of Petitioner
He also pointed out that insofar as sale of advertisement rights during the Event is concerned that was also to be given to Beta Prema 2 Ltd. which was again an independent company and taken over by FOWC in the year 2006.	Arguments of Petitioner
49.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Ganesh, extensively referred to the findings of AAR on this issue wherein the case of FOWC and Jaypee on this aspect was accepted by AAR and pleaded that the aforesaid findings be accepted and restored by this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Referring to the judgment of the High Court, his submission was that the Organisation Agreement entered into between FIA and Jaypee was not even discussed and the conclusions given in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the said judgment were erroneous.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also relied upon certain observations of this Court in Union of India Anr.	Arguments of Petitioner
v. Azadi Bachao Andolan Anr., 2004 (10) SCC 1 2003 (262) ITR 706 in respect of his submission	Arguments of Petitioner
that transactions could not be treated as sham.	Arguments of Petitioner
50.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Datar, learned senior counsel appearing for Jaypee, supplemented the aforesaid submissions of Mr. Ganesh on the issue of the PE.	Arguments of Petitioner
He argued that the judgment of the High Court was flawed in its approach as it had gone by inductive logic instead of deductive logic.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, the first question which has to be focused upon was as to what is the business of FOWC.	Arguments of Petitioner
His submission was that since in this case business of FOWC was not to organise these races, the question of its PE in India, that too in the form of circuit where the race is to be held, could not be PE of FOWC.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also submitted that even after going through all the clauses of the agreement between FOWC and Jaypee with a toothcomb, it would be found that FOWC had no physical control over the said circuit.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this behalf, he emphasised the test laid down by Andhra Pradesh High Court in Visakhapatnam Port Trust, which is recognised by Philip Baker in his commentary.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also argued that entire Formula One Event was a temporary model for three days in a year only and even if it is accepted that the FOWC had control over this place for those three days, possession of the site for three days in a year cannot be termed as PE.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also emphasised the fact that since FOWC was a UK resident company, it had been paying taxes in its own country.	Arguments of Petitioner
For a nonresident to pay taxes in other country, as in India in the instant case, threshold has to be very high and the issue of PE had to be examined with this focus in mind.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that this was precisely the reason that such sports events held in other countries are never taxed in those countries.	Arguments of Petitioner
51.	Arguments of Petitioner
His alternate submission was that the agreement in question was signed in UK under which consideration of US 40 million was paid and, therefore, this income accrued in UK.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, such income was taxable in UK.	Arguments of Petitioner
He argued that insofar as rights to hold the events are concerned they were granted in UK and it is the grant of rights which was the determinative test and implementation of those rights took place in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of this proposition, he relied on the judgment of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax, Andhra Pradesh v. M s. Toshoku Ltd., Guntur Ors., (1980)	Arguments of Petitioner
Supp SCC 614 1981 AIR 148 where the law is discussed in the following manner The second aspect of the same question is whether the commission amounts credited in the books of the statutory agent can be treated as incomes accrued, arisen, or deemed to have accrued or arisen in India to the nonresident assessees during the relevant year.	None
This takes us to Section 9 of the Act.	None
It is urged that the commission amounts should be treated as incomes deemed to have accrued or arisen in India as they, according to the Department, had either accrued or arisen through and from the business connection in India that existed between the nonresident assessees and the statutory agent.	None
This contention overlooks the effect of clause (a) of the Explanation to clause (i) of subsection (1) of Section 9 of the Act which provides that in the case of business of which all the operations are not carried out in India, the income of the business deemed under that clause to accrue or arise in India shall be only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the operations carried out in India.	None
If all such operations are carried out in India, the entire income accruing therefrom shall be deemed to have accrued in India.	None
If, however, all the operations are not carried out in the taxable territories, the profits and gains of business deemed to accrue in India through and from business connection in India shall be only such profits and gains as are reasonably attributable to that part of the operations carried out in the taxable territories.	None
If no operations of business are carried out in the taxable territories, it follows that the income accruing or arising abroad through or from any business connection in India cannot be deemed to accrue or arise in India.	None

Another submission of Mr. Ganesh was that the High Court did not have jurisdiction, in exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution, to go into the findings of AAR on the issue of fixed place.	Arguments of Petitioner
He argued that under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court exercised Certiorari jurisdiction and in exercise of such a jurisdiction, findings of facts recorded by the Tribunal, which are the subject matter of judicial review, cannot be gone into.	Arguments of Petitioner
53.	Arguments of Petitioner
Without prejudice to the aforesaid submissions, next argument of Mr. Datar was that having regard to the facts of this case, no interest should be held payable under Section 201 of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Referring to the scheme of Chapter XXIXB which pertains to advance rulings, he submitted that the parties had shown their bona fides in having the question raised before the AAR, and it was specifically agreed to between FOWC and Jaypee in Clause 24.6 of the Agreement that the parties should approach AAR for determination of the questions which were referred.	Arguments of Petitioner
He pointed out that once an application was made before the AAR, procedure that is contained in Section 245R, on receipt of such applications, had to be followed by AAR and in that event Section 245 RR mandates that no income tax authority or the appellate tribunal shall proceed to decide any issue in respect of which an application has been made by the applicant, being a resident, under Section 245QQ for advance ruling.	Arguments of Petitioner
Once advance ruling is pronounced by AAR, it was binding on the applicant who had sought the same in respect of a particular transaction as well as on the Principal Commissioner and Commissioner of Income Tax Authorities subordinate to him.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, in such a scenario, it should not be considered that Jaypee had failed to deduct tax at source from the amounts paid to FOWC and as a consequence of failure to deduct, it should be fastened with the liability to pay interest under Section 201.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support, paragraph 12 of GE India Technology Centre Private Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax Anr., (2010) 10 SCC 29 was pressed into service which reads as follows Reference to ITO(TDS) under Section 195(2) or Section 195(3)	None
either by the nonresident or by the resident payer is to avoid any future hassles for both the resident as well as the nonresident.	None
In our view, Sections 195(2) and 195(3) are safeguards.	None
The said provisions are of practical importance.	None
This reasoning of ours is based on the decision of this Court in Transmission Corpn.	None
(1999) 7 SCC 266 (1999) 239 ITR 587 in which this Court has observed that the provision of Section 195(2) is a safeguard.	None
From this it follows that where a person responsible for deduction is fairly certain then he can make his own determination as to whether the tax was deductible at source and, if so, what should be the amount thereof.	None
Last submission of Mr. Datar was that in any case it was yet to be determined as to how much of US 40 million fee paid by Jaypee to FOWC could be attributed to PE, inasmuch as it is only that portion of income that is relatable to PE which is liable for tax in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
This has not happened so far.	Arguments of Petitioner
55.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Dushant Dave, learned senior counsel, again appearing for Jaypee, made an additional submission to the effect that international treaties which are signed between the two sovereign countries have to be given adequate and due respect which they command.	Arguments of Petitioner
He exhorted the Court to keep this fundamental principle in mind while interpreting clause 5 of DTAA and submitted that such an approach has been commanded by this Court time and again.	Arguments of Petitioner
By way of example, he cited the judgements in the cases of Azadi Bachao Andolan and Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel Etc. v. Union of India and Another, 1970 (3) SCC 400 .	Arguments of Petitioner
He also referred to paragraph 6 of the UK judgment in the case of Sepet v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, 2003 (3) AllER 304 wherein it was pressed that single autonomous meaning was required to be given to the treaties which are living instruments whose meaning does not change over time but application will.	Arguments of Petitioner
From Azadi Bachao Andolan following passages were relied upon Every country seeks to tax the income generated within its territory on the basis of one or more connecting factors such as location of the source, residence of the taxable entity, maintenance of a permanent establishment, and so on.	None
A country might choose to emphasise one or the other of the aforesaid factors for exercising fiscal jurisdiction to tax the entity.	None
Depending on which of the factors is considered to be the connecting factor in different countries, the same income of the same entity might become liable to taxation in different countries.	None
This would give rise to harsh consequences and impair economic development.	None
In order to avoid such an anomalous and incongruous situation, the Governments of different countries enter into bilateral treaties, conventions or agreements for granting relief against double taxation.	None
Such treaties, conventions or agreements are called Double Taxation Avoidance Treaties, Conventions or Agreements.	None

The principles adopted in interpretation of treaties are not the same as those in interpretation of a statutory legislation.	None
While commenting on the interpretation of a treaty imported into a municipal law, Francis Bennion observes With indirect enactment, instead of the substantive legislation taking the wellknown form of an Act of Parliament, it has the form of a treaty.	None
In other words, the form and language found suitable for embodying an international agreement become, at the stroke of a pen, also the form and language of a municipal legislative instrument.	None
It is rather like saying that, by Act of Parliament, a woman shall be a man.	None
Inconveniences may ensue.	None
One inconvenience is that the interpreter is likely to be required to cope with disorganised composition instead of precision drafting.	None
The drafting of treaties is notoriously sloppy usually for a very good reason.	None
To get agreement, politic uncertainty is called for.	None
The interpretation of a treaty imported into municipal law by indirect enactment was described by Lord Wilberforce as being unconstrained by technical rules of English law, or by English legal precedent, but conducted on broad principles of general acceptation.	None
This echoes the optimistic dictum of Lord Widgery, C.J. that the words are to be given their general meaning, general to lawyer and layman alike the meaning of the diplomat rather than the lawyer.	None

An important principle which needs to be kept in mind in the interpretation of the provisions of an international treaty, including one for double taxation relief, is that treaties are negotiated and entered into at a political level and have several considerations as their bases.	None
Commenting on this aspect of the matter, David R. Davis in Principles of International Double Taxation Relief David R. Davis Principles of International Double Taxation Relief, p. 4 (London, Sweet Maxwell, 1985), points out that the main function of a Double Taxation Avoidance Treaty should be seen in the context of aiding commercial relations between treaty partners and as being essentially a bargain between two treaty countries as to the division of tax revenues between them in respect of income falling to be taxed in both jurisdictions.	None
It is observed (vide paragraph 1.06)	None
The benefits and detriments of a double tax treaty will probably only be truly reciprocal where the flow of trade and investment between treaty partners is generally in balance.	None
Where this is not the case, the benefits of the treaty may be weighed more in favour of one treaty partner than the other, even though the provisions of the treaty are expressed in reciprocal terms.	None
This has been identified as occurring in relation to tax treaties between developed and developing countries, where the flow of trade and investment is largely oneway.	None
Because treaty negotiations are largely a bargaining process with each side seeking concessions from the other, the final agreement will often represent a number of compromises, and it may be uncertain as to whether a full and sufficient quid pro quo is obtained by both sides.	None
And, finally, in paragraph 1.08 Apart from the allocation of tax between the treaty partners, tax treaties can also help to resolve problems and can obtain benefits which cannot be achieved unilaterally.	None

Although Indian economic reforms since 1991 permitted such capital transfers, the amount would have been much lower without the IndiaMauritius Tax Treaty Overall, countries need to take, and do take, a holistic view.	None
Developing countries allow treaty shopping to encourage capital and technology inflows, which developed countries are keen to provide to them.	None
The loss of tax revenues could be insignificant compared to the other nontax benefits to their economy.	None
Many of them do not appear to be too concerned unless the revenue losses are significant compared to the other tax and nontax benefits from the treaty, or the treaty shopping leads to other tax abuses.	None
Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned Attorney General, came out with strong refutation to the aforesaid submissions.	Arguments of Respondent
Responding in an equally salubrious style, he demonstrated the flow of commercial rights in relation to these events, under various agreements executed between different stakeholders from time to time and the manner in which such rights are ultimately exploited by FOWC and its other group companies in respect of the F1 race organized in India.	Arguments of Respondent

From the features described above, it was submitted by the learned Attorney General that clear manifestation of the aforesaid agreements was that FOWC and its subsidiaries had taken total control over the event that took place in India which, according to him, was to be kept in mind for proper examination of the issues in their right perspective.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Rohtagi argued that Section 5(2)(b) of the Act, which applies in the instant case, specifically includes income of a nonresident from whatever source derived, if this income accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during such year.	Arguments of Respondent
Referring to Section 9 of the Act, which specifies the circumstances under which income shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India, he pointed out that it covers all income, whether directly or indirectly, that accrues or arises, if it is through or from any business connection in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, if business connection is established, then all incomes, whether earned directly or indirectly, would come within the net of taxability of such incomes in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Referring to explanation (2) to Section 9(1)(i), he laid stress on the submission that business connection shall include any business activity through a person who acts on behalf of the nonresident.	Arguments of Respondent
The expression through is clarified in explanation (4) thereof to mean and include and shall be deemed to have always meant and include by means of, in consequence of or by reason of.	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that these deeming provisions are of very vide import and when the facts of this case are examined keeping in view the aforesaid provisions, the High Court rightly concluded that FOWC had PE in India.	Arguments of Respondent
He also argued that Jaypee was only to host the event, whereas total access at the time of construction as well as at the time of event was that of FOWC.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, at the most, it was in the nature of Jaypee and FOWC as partners in the business.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Rohatgi also submitted that comparisons of first Agreement of 2007 with the second Agreement dated September 13, 2011 clearly demonstrates that the second agreement was totally subterfuge to avoid payment of tax in India.	Arguments of Respondent
He pointed out that in the Agreement dated October 25, 2007, FOWC was granted only the right to promote the event (Clause 4(1)), whereas in the Agreement dated September 13, 2011, right to host, stage and promote the event was allegedly given to Jaypee by FOWC.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, right to host and stage the event was conferred upon Jaypee only on paper to give it a semblance as if Jaypee was in real control of the affairs, which was not actually so.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, in any case, it would not make any difference when in reality the rights of hosting and staging the competition were with FOWC.	Arguments of Respondent
Referring to the Agreement dated September 13, 2011 between Jaypee and three affiliates of FOWC, the argument of Mr. Rohatgi was that the socalled rights given to Jaypee were transferred back to FOWC affiliates inasmuch as Beta Prema 2 acquired circuit rights, mainly media and title sponsorship, whereas Allsports was given paddock rights.	Arguments of Respondent
His submission was that business was carried from the circuit, paddock, etc. and, therefore, it cannot be said that no business activity was carried from this place.	Arguments of Respondent
He also pointed out how FOWC granted rights to FOAM to provide various services in case FOWC had no control over the race.	Arguments of Respondent
It also showed physical management of the business as well.	Arguments of Respondent
Coming to the issue of dependent PEs, submission of the learned Attorney General was that in view of the flowchart depicting commercial rights with FOWC and its affiliates, this issue was virtually an academic issue once it is found that FOWC and its affiliates are one conglomerate, the commercial rights of different nature, viz.	Arguments of Respondent
the CRH bouquet was with the group companies under the control of same management which exploited all these rights.	Arguments of Respondent
These companies had pooled all the profits and sharing thereof was in the ratio of 5050 between the teams and CRH companies.	Arguments of Respondent
As far as power of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to go into the issue is concerned, Mr. Rohatgi drew the attention of the Court to its earlier judgment in Columbia Sportswear Company v. Director of Income Tax, Bangalore, (2012) 11 SCC 224 wherein this Court had impressed that from the rulings of AAR the aggrieved person was required to approach the High Court in the first instance.

He, thus, submitted that it was the first forum of judicial review of the opinion given by the AAR and, therefore, the High Court was very well within its power to revisit the issue albeit within the scope of jurisdiction of Article 226 of the Constitution of India, and decide the same.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, the High Court had not exceeded its jurisdiction while deciding the aforesaid issues in the writ petitions filed by the appellants themselves.	Arguments of Respondent
Refuting the arguments of Mr. Datar predicated on Section 195 of the Act, Mr. Rohatgi referred to the judgment of this Court in GE India Technology Centre Private Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax Anr., (2010) 10 SCC 29 wherein following principle is laid down in paragraph 18	Arguments of Respondent
If the contention of the Department that any person making payment to a nonresident is necessarily required to deduct TAS	None
then the consequence would be that the Department would be entitled to appropriate the monies deposited by the payer even if the sum paid is not chargeable to tax because there is no provision in the IT Act by which a payer can obtain refund.	None
Section 237 read with Section 199 implies that only the recipient of the sum i.e. the payee could seek a refund.	None
It must therefore follow, if the Department is right, that the law requires tax to be deducted on all payments.	None
The payer, therefore, has to deduct and pay tax, even if the socalled deduction comes out of his own pocket and he has no remedy whatsoever, even where the sum paid by him is not a sum chargeable under the Act.	None
The interpretation of the Department, therefore, not only requires the words chargeable under the provisions of the Act to be omitted, it also leads to an absurd consequence.	None
The interpretation placed by the Department would result in a situation where even when the income has no territorial nexus with India or is not chargeable in India, the Government would nonetheless collect tax.	None
In our view, Section 195(2) provides a remedy by which a person may seek a determination of the appropriate proportion of such sum so chargeable where a proportion of the sum so chargeable is liable to tax.	None
He, thus, submitted that if there was any breach of the said provision, the Income Tax Department was well within its right to charge interest and or impose penalty.	Arguments of Respondent
In rejoinder, M s. Ganesh and Datar gave their answers to the aforesaid submissions, but it may not be necessary to reproduce the same at this stage as we would like to take note of the same while dealing with the respective submissions.	None
ANALYSIS, FINDINGS CONCLUSION We have pondered over the aforesaid submissions of the learned counsel for the parties with all seriousness and sincerity they deserve.	Reasoning
We have also minutely gone through the material placed on record.	Reasoning
We have kept in mind the governing law that has already been stated in detail.	Reasoning
We are also conscious of the approach that is needed to examine these kinds of issues, as discussed in the judgments referred to by Mr. Dave.	Reasoning
Likewise, we have also microscopically examined the judgment of the High Court which is under challenge.	Reasoning
As per Article 5 of the DTAA, the PE has to be a fixed place of business through which business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.	None
Some examples of fixed place are given in Article 5(2), by way of an inclusion.	None
Article 5(3), on the other hand, excludes certain places which would not be treated as PE, i.e. what is mentioned in clauses (a) to (f) as the negative list.	None
A combined reading of subarticles (1), (2) and (3) of Article 5 would clearly show that only certain forms of establishment are excluded as mentioned in Article 5(3), which would not be PEs.	None
Otherwise, subarticle (2) uses the word include which means that not only the places specified therein are to be treated as PEs, the list of such PEs is not exhaustive.	None
In order to bring any other establishment which is not specifically mentioned, the requirements laid down in subarticle (1) are to be satisfied.	None
Twin conditions which need to be satisfied are (i) existence of a fixed place of business and (b) through that place business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried out.	None
We are of the firm opinion, and it cannot be denied, that Buddh International Circuit is a fixed place.	Reasoning
From this circuit different races, including the Grand Prix is conducted, which is undoubtedly an economic business activity.	Reasoning
The core question is as to whether this was put at the disposal of FOWC?	Reasoning
Whether this was a fixed place of business of FOWC is the next question.	Reasoning
We would like to start our discussion on a crucial parameter viz.	Reasoning
the manner in which commercial rights, which are held by FOWC and its affiliates, have been exploited in the instant case.	Reasoning
For this purpose entire arrangement between FOWC and its associates on the one hand and Jaypee on the other hand, is to be kept in mind.	Reasoning
Various agreements cannot be looked into by isolating them from each other.	Reasoning
Their wholesome reading would bring out the real transaction between the parties.	Reasoning
Such an approach is essentially required to find out as to who is having real and dominant control over the Event, thereby providing an answer to the question as to whether Buddh International Circuit was at the disposal of FOWC and whether it carried out any business therefrom or not.	Reasoning
There is an inalienable relevance of witnessing the wholesome arrangement in order to have complete picture of the relationship between FOWC and Jaypee.	Reasoning
That would enable us to capture the real essence of FOWCs role.	Reasoning
A mere running of the eye over the flowchart of these commercial rights, produced by the Revenue, bring about the following material factors, evidently discernible FIA had assigned commercial rights in favour of FOAM vide agreement dated April 24, 2001 and on the same day another agreement was signed between FOAM and FOWC vide which these rights were transferred to FOWC.	None
Vide another agreement of 2011, these rights stand transferred in favour of FOWC for a period of 100 years.	None
Vide Concorde Agreement of 2009, FOWC is authorised to exploit the commercial rights directly or through its affiliates only.	None
Significantly, this agreement defines F1 Business to mean exploitation of various rights, including media rights, hospitality rights, title sponsorship, etc.	None
Armed with the aforesaid rights, FOWC signed first agreement with Jaypee on October 25, 2007 whereby it granted right to promote the event to Jaypee.	Reasoning
This is replaced by RPC dated September 13, 2011.	None
Under this agreement, right to host, stage and promote the event are given by FOWC to Jaypee for a consideration of US 40 million.	Reasoning
On the same day, another agreement is signed between Jaypee and three affiliates of FOWC whereby Jaypee gives back circuit rights, mainly media and title sponsorship, to Beta Prema 2 and paddock rights to Allsports.	Arguments of Respondent
FOAM is engaged to generate TV Feed.	None
All the revenues from the aforesaid activities are to go to the said companies, namely, Beta Prema 2, Allsports and FOAM respectively.	None
These three companies are admittedly affiliates to FOWC.	None
Though Beta Prema 2 is given media rights, etc., on September 13, 2011, it had entered into title sponsorship agreement dated August 16, 2011 with Bharti Airtel (i.e. more than a month before getting these rights from Jaypee) whereby it transferred those rights to Bharti Airtel for a consideration of US 8 million.	None
Service agreement is signed between FOWC and FOAM on October 28, 2011 (i.e. on the date of the race) whereby FOAM engaged FOWC to provide various services like licensing and supervision of other parties at the event, travel and transport and data support services.	None
The aforesaid arrangement clearly demonstrates that the entire event is taken over and controlled by FOWC and its affiliates.	None
There cannot be any race without participating competing teams, a circuit and a paddock.	None
All these are controlled by FOWC and its affiliates.	None
Event has taken place by conduct of race physically in India.	None
Entire income is generated from the conduct of this event in India.	None
Thus, commercial rights are with FOWC which are exploited with actual conduct of race in India.	None
Even the physical control of the circuit was with FOWC and its affiliates from the inception, i.e. inclusion of event in a circuit till the conclusion of the event.	None
Omnipresence of FOWC and its stamp over the event is loud, clear and firm.	None
Mr. Rohatgi is right in his submission that the undisputed facts were that race was physically conducted in India and from this race income was generated in India.	None
Therefore, a commonsense and plain thinking of the entire situation would lead to the conclusion that FOWC had made their earning in India through the said track over which they had complete control during the period of race.	None
The appellants are trying to trivialize the issue by harping on the fact that duration of the event was three days and, therefore, control, if at all, would be for that period only.	None
His reply was that the duration of the agreement was five years, which was extendable to another five years.	None
The question of the PE has to be examined keeping in mind that the aforesaid race was to be conducted only for three days in a year and for the entire period of race the control was with FOWC.	None
Even when we examine the matter by examining the RPC agreement itself, it points towards the same conclusion.	None
The High Court in its judgment has reproduced relevant clauses of the agreement which we have already reproduced above.	None
This agreement is analysed by the High Court.	None
Therefore, we are spared of doing a diagnostic of sorts, which exercise is accomplished by the High Court itself in a flawless manner The Buddh International Circuit, is defined in Clause 1(q), as one suitable in every respect for the staging of the event, including permanent buildings, permanent structure, track laidout, amenities, spectator viewing facilities, paddock building, media centre, car parks, helipads, garages, race control and administration, office administration, fuel and storage, tyre store, utilities, including backup power supplies, concretebased areas suitable to host competitors and sponsor, vending and exhibition areas, international TV compounds etc.	None
These specifications are more elaborately spelt out in Clause 5(e) which states that a circuit shall be constructed, laid out and prepared in accordance with the agreement, i.e. RPC, in a form and manner approved by the FOWC and the FIA.	None
The inclusion of the event is through the FOWCs actions.	None
In terms of its arrangement with the FIA, it is the exclusive agency through which any particular circuit is introduced for an event in a given calendar year.	None
The term of the RPC is 5 years according to Clauses 3.3 and 3.4.	None
In terms of Clause 11, Jaypee is obliged to take all action necessary to ensure that the pit, paddock buildings and surrounding areas within the circuit and land are open to receive the competitors, FOWC, affiliates of FOWC, FOWCs contractors and licensees, other personnel and equipment at all times during the period commencing 14 days before the race and ending 7 days after the race.	None
It also has to assure security to these areas.	None
Under Clause 14, the promoter is obliged to authorize access to parts of the circuit not open to the main public only through passes issued by the FOWC.	None
Under Clause 14(b), the public cannot have access to the cars in any of the places where the competitors mechanics may be called upon to work on them and under Clause 14(c), the validity of passes issued by FOWC is unquestionable.	None
Under Clause 18.1, throughout the term during the access period, from the test session held at the circuit till the end of the event, the promoter, i.e. Jaypee cannot permit, access, enable, procure or in any manner encourage others to make, create, store, record or transmit any sound recording or visual or audiovisual footage whatsoever, for broadcast or any other purpose, of any of at or pertaining to the event, including cars, drivers, competitors etc.	None
and in fact cannot make any such recording etc.	None
within the confines of the circuit or the land over which Jaypee itself has control.	None
Under Clause 18.2, Jaypee has to ensure that the terms of the ticket sale, giving admittance to the event include a condition imposed on the ticket holder not to make any kind of recording or take any recording device that can store or transmit any part of the event and that the ticket holder as a spectator could be filmed and a sound made by him could be recorded for broadcast or any other such item that the FOWC could impose on Jaypee.	None
Jaypee is obliged to engage a third party approved by FOWC to carry out and perform on its behalf all service relating to the origination of the international television feed and host broadcasting for each event during the term specified in the guidelines published by FOWC and provided to Jaypee.	None
Jaypee unconditionally and irrevocably under Clause 19.2 assigned to FOWC all copyright and other intellectual property rights, titles and interest which it may now or may in future possess, in any image or recording or other presentation or recording in any image form whatsoever for the duration of the rights and also give consent to FOWC to deal with such rights as it pleased.	None
Clause 20.1 obliged Jaypee to ensure that those accredited and authorized by FOWC were permitted to enter upon the premises to make sound, television or recordings or transmissions or make films or other pictures and use the facilities throughout the access period and also undertook to accord to such personnel all help and facilities that FOWC would require, including assistance for consent, permission or authorization with any local authority.	None
Under Clause 21, Jaypee was prohibited from causing, permitting, enabling assisting or in any manner encouraging display of any advertisement (other than the normal advertisement displayed on any competitors cars) or other displays on, near or which could be seen from the circuit or the land which, in the opinion of the FOWC, could prevent lawful transmission of images or recordings of the event.	None
FOWCs say in this regard was final.	None
In the Director?s report of FOWC, the company significantly mentioned that its current company had entered into an agreement with FIA as a result of which FOWC acquired commercial interests in the championship which became operative from 01.11.2011 and that in exploitation of such commercial rights in the championship, the total revenues generated was US 1205 million.	None
There is an express advertence of the Indian part of the turnover  inasmuch as the report said that the company paid US 127 million to FOM in return of provision of services.	None
We are in agreement with the aforesaid analysis which correctly captures the substance of the relevant clauses of the agreement.	Reasoning
We are also of the opinion that the High Court has rightly concluded that having regard to the duration of the event, which was for limited days, and for the entire duration FOWC had full access through its personnel, number of days for which the access was there would not make any difference.	Reasoning
This aspect is discussed by the High Court in the following manner, and rightly so It is evident that for the duration of the event as well as two weeks prior to it and a week succeeding it, FOWC had full access through its personnel, the team contracted to it, both racing as well as spectator teams and could also dictate who were authorized to enter the areas reserved for it.	None
No doubt, in terms of the agreement, i.e. RPC, Jaypee was designated as the promoter or the event host.	None
A look at the RPC and its terms as well as the other terms contained in the agreement between the Jaypee on the one hand and Allsports, Beta Prema 2 as well as FOAM show that Jaypees capacity to act  though it promoted the event, was extremely restricted.	None
At all material times, FOWC had access  exclusively, to the circuit, and all the spaces where the teams were located.	None
Jaypee created the circuit for the purposes of the event and other events yet, during the event, i.e. the F1 Championship, no other event was possible.	None
Having regard to the nature of the preceding discussion, it is evident that though FOWCs access or right to access was not permanent, in the sense of its being everlasting, at the same time, the model of commercial transactions it chose is such that its exclusive circuit access  to the team and its personnel or those contracted by it, was for upto six weeks at a time during the F1 Championship season.	None
This nature of activity, i.e racing and exploitation of all the bundle of rights the FOWC had as CRH, meant that it was a shifting or moving presence the teams competed in the race in a given place and after its conclusion, moved on to another locale where a similar race is conducted.	None
Now with this kind of activity, although there may not be substantiality in an absolute sense with regard to the time period, both the exclusive nature of the access and the period for which it is accessed, in the opinion of the Court, makes the presence of a kind contemplated under Article 5(1), i.e. it is fixed.	None
In other words, the presence is neither ephemeral or fleeting, or sporadic.	None
The fact that RPC2011s tenure is of five years, meant that there was a repetition furthermore, FOWC was entitled even in the event of a termination, to two years payment of the assured consideration of US 40 million (Clause 24 of the RPC).	None
Having regard to the OECD commentary and Klaus Vogels commentary on the general principles applicable that as long as the presence is in a physically defined geographical area, permanence in such fixed place could be relative having regard to the nature of the business, it is hereby held that the circuit itself constituted a fixed place of business.	None
A stand at a trade fair, occupied regularly for three weeks a year, through which an enterprise obtained contracts for a significant part of its annual sales, was held to constitute a PE (Refer Footnote 4).	Reasoning
Likewise, a temporary restaurant operated in a mirror tent at a Dutch flower show for a period of seven months was held to constitute a PE (Refer Footnote 5).	Reasoning
The High Court has also referred to some of the judgments which are of relevance.	None
We would like to take note of those judgments as we had agreed with the conclusions of the High Court on this issue In Universal Furniture Ind. AB v. Government of Norway, (Stavanger Court, Case No. 9900421, dated 19121999 referred to in Principles of International Taxation by Anghard Miller and Lyn Oates, 2012), a Swedish company sold furniture abroad that was assembled in Sweden.	None
It hired an individual tax resident of Norway to look after its sales in Norway, including sales to a Swedish company, which used to compensate him for use of a phone and other facilities.	None
Later, the company discontinued such payments and increased his salary.	None
The Norwegian tax authorities said that the Swedish company had its place of business in Norway.	None
The Norwegian court agreed, holding that the salesmans house amounted to a place of business it was sufficient that the Swedish Company had a place at its disposal, i.e the Norwegian individuals home, which could be regarded as fixed.	None
In Joseph Fowler v. Her Majesty the Queen, 1990 (2) CTC 2351, the issue was whether a United States tax resident individual who used to visit and sell his wares in a camper trailer, in fairs, for a number of years had a fixed place of business in Canada.	None
The fairs used to be once a year, approximately for three weeks each.	None
The court observed that the nature of the individuals business was such that he held sales in similar fares, for duration of two or three weeks, in two other locales in the United States.	None
The court held that conceptually, the place was one of business, notwithstanding the short duration, because it amounted to a place of management or a branch having regard to peculiarities of the business.	None
Coming to the second aspect of the issue, namely, whether FOWC carried on any business and commercial activity in India or not, substantial part of this aspect has already been discussed and taken care of above.	Reasoning
Without being repetitive and pleonastic or tautologous, we may only add that FOWC is the Commercial Right Holder (CRH).	Reasoning
These rights can be exploited with the conduct of F1 Championship, which is organised in various countries.	Reasoning
It was decided to have this championship in India as well.	Reasoning
In order to undertake conducting of such races, the first requirement is to have a track for this purpose.	Reasoning
Then, teams are needed who would participate in the competition.	Reasoning
Another requirement is to have the public viewers who would be interested in witnessing such races from the places built around the track.	Reasoning
Again, for augmenting the earnings in these events, there would be advertisements, media rights, etc. as well.	Reasoning
It is FOWC and its affiliates which have been responsible for all the aforesaid activities.	Reasoning
The Concorde Agreement is signed between FIA, FOA and FOWC whereby not only FOWC became Commercial Rights Holder for 100 years, this agreement further enabled participation of the teams who agreed for such participation in the FIA Championship each year for every event and undertook to participate in each event with two cars.	Reasoning
FIA undertook to ensure that events were held and FOWC, as CRH, undertook to enter into contracts with event promoters and host such events.	Reasoning
All possible commercial rights, including advertisement, media rights, etc. and even right to sell paddock seats, were assumed by FOWC and its associates.	Reasoning
Thus, as a part of its business, FOWC (as well as its affiliates) undertook the aforesaid commercial activities in India.	Reasoning
Without explaining this aspect further, our purpose would be served by reproducing the following discussion, so starkly put in the judgment of the High Court If the terms of the Concorde Agreement are read conjointly with the RPC2011, it is apparent that the CRH, which is the FOWC, only and none else has the right to include a venue in any FIA annual calendar.	None
FIA is bound to accord permission for such inclusion FOWC is the exclusive commercial rights holder of a host of rights (evident from the recital in the Concorde Agreement that FIA, FOWC and other members of the CRH group had entered into such contracts to enable commercial exploitation of the rights for a 100 year period).	None
Under the RPC2011, only FOWC has exclusive rights towards making sound, television and other recordings and exploitation of its media rights.	None
FOWC has copyright over databases and all related information, etc. generated, during the event, including practice sessions etc.	None
(Clause 22, RPC2011).	None
Only those accredited by FOWC can enter the promoters premises and circuit to make sound and television recordings, etc.	None
It is quite apparent that save a limited class of rights (those relating to paddock entry, ticketing, hospitality at the venue and a restricted class of advertising), all commercial exploitation rights vest exclusively with FOWC.	None
FOWC did accept them and was entitled to charge fees or such other consideration as it deemed appropriate for the recording, telecasting, broadcasting and creation of internet and media rights, including data transmission, and all other such commercially exploitable rights.	None
In addition, FOWC charged, by Clause 24 of RPC2011, a fee of US 40 million annually from Jaypee, in relation to the race event or FIA F1 Championship event conducted on the circuit in India.	None
It is also noteworthy that by virtue of the Concorde Agreement, the teams have undertaken to engage in every race  with the added condition that each team would involve two cars for every race in any circuit chosen by FOWC.	None
RPC2011 also assured that the FOWC would ensure that such team did in fact participate in the event in the Budh Circuit.	None
This is an important fact which shows that the entire event, i.e. F1 FIA Championship in the circuit was organized and controlled in every sense of the term by FOWC.	None
The peculiarity of this activity is such that FOWCs dominant role is evident it is the moving spirit with all pervasive presence and control through the teams, which are contracted to participate in the event.	None
In fact, it creates the event, i.e. the race.	None
Each actor, such the promoter Jaypee, the racing teams, the constructing teams and the other affiliates, plays a part in the event.	None
FOWCs participation and the undertakings given to it by each of these actors, who are responsible for the event as a whole, brings out its central and dominant role.	None
If Jaypee is the event promoter, which owns the title to the circuit in the sense that it owns the land, FOWC is the commercial rights owner of the event, by virtue of the Concorde Agreement.	None
FIA parted with all its rights over each commercial right it possessed to FOWC.	None
The bulk of the revenue earned is through media, television and other related rights.	None
The terms or the basis of those rights is the event.	None
The conceptualization of the event and the right to include it in any particular circuit, such as Buddh Circuit is that of the FOWC it decides the venue and the participating teams are bound to it to compete in the race in the terms agreed with the FOWC.	None
All these, in the opinion of the Court, unequivocally, show that the FOWC carried on business in India for the duration of the race (and for two weeks before the race and a week thereafter).	None
Every right, which it possessed was monetized the US 40 million which Jaypee paid was only a part of that commercial exploitation by the FOWC.	None
Consequently, the Court concludes that the FOWC carried on business in India within the meaning of expression under Article 5(1) of the DTAA.	None
It is consequently held that the AAR fell into error of law in holding that FOWC did not function through a PE carry on business through a fixed place of business in India.	None
In view of the above, it is difficult to accept the arguments of the appellants that it is Jaypee who was responsible for conducting races and had complete control over the Event in question.	Reasoning
Mere construction of the track by Jaypee at its expense will be of no consequence.	Reasoning
Its ownership or organising other events by Jaypee is also immaterial.	Reasoning
Our examination is limited to the conduct of the F1 Championship and control over the track during that period.	Reasoning
Specific arrangement between the parties relating to the aforesaid, which is elaborated above and which FOWC and Jaypee unsuccessfully endeavoured to ignore, has in fact turned the table against them.	Reasoning
It is also difficult to accept their submission that FOWC had no role in the conduct of the Championship and its role came to an end with granting permission to host the Event as a round of the championship.	Reasoning
We also reject the argument of the appellants that the Buddh International Circuit was not under the control and at the disposal of FOWC.	Reasoning
No doubt, FOWC, as CRH of these events, is in the business of exploiting these rights, including intellectual property rights.	Reasoning
However, these became possible, in the instant case, only with the actual conduct of these races and active participation of FOWC in the said races, with access and control over the circuit.	Reasoning
We are of the opinion that the test laid down by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Visakhapatnam Port Trust case fully stands satisfied.	Reasoning
Not only the Buddh International Circuit is a fixed place where the commercial economic activity of conducting F1 Championship was carried out, one could clearly discern that it was a virtual projection of the foreign enterprise, namely, Formula1 (i.e. FOWC) on the soil of this country.	Reasoning
It is already noted above that as per Philip Baker (A Manual on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital), a PE must have three characteristics stability, productivity and dependence.	Reasoning
All characteristics are present in this case.	Reasoning
Fixed place of business in the form of physical location, i.e. Buddh International Circuit, was at the disposal of FOWC through which it conducted business.	Reasoning
Aesthetics of law and taxation jurisprudence leave no doubt in our mind that taxable event has taken place in India and nonresident FOWC is liable to pay tax in India on the income it has earned on this soil.	Reasoning
We are now left with two other incidental issues which were raised by Mr. Datar.	Reasoning
First was on the interpretation of Section 195 of the Act.	Reasoning
It cannot be disputed that a person who makes the payment to a nonresident is under an obligation to deduct tax under Section 195 of the Act on such payments.	Reasoning
Mr. Rohatgi had submitted, and rightly so, that this issue is covered by the judgment in the case of GE India Technology Centre Private Limited (Refer Footnote 23).	Reasoning
Precisely this very judgment is taken note of and relied upon by the High Court also in holding that since payments made by Jaypee to FOWC under the RPC were business income of the FOWC through PE at the Buddh International Circuit, and, therefore, chargeable to tax, Jaypee was bound to make appropriate deductions from the amounts paid under Section 195 of the Act.	Reasoning
We are, however, inclined to accept the submission of Mr. Datar that only that portion of the income of FOWC, which is attributable to the said PE, would be treated as business income of FOWC and only that part of income deduction was required to be made under Section 195 of the Act.	Reasoning
In GE India Technology Centre Private Limited (Refer Footnote 23), this Court has clarified that though there is an obligation to deduct tax, the obligation is limited to the appropriate portion of income which is chargeable to tax in India and in respect of other payments where no tax is payable, recourse is to be made under Section 195(2) of the Act.	Reasoning
It would be for the Assessing Officer to adjudicate upon the aforesaid aspects while passing the Assessment Order, namely, how much business income of FOWC is attributable to PE in India, which is chargeable to tax.	Reasoning
At that stage, Jaypee can also press its argument that penalty etc. be not charged as the move on the part of Jaypee in not deducting tax at source was bona fide.	Reasoning
We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion either way.	Reasoning
Insofar as the argument of Mr. Datar on the powers of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is concerned, we are not impressed by the said argument.	Reasoning
It is Jaypee itself which had filed the writ petition (and for that matter FOWC as well) and they had challenged the orders of AAR on certain aspects.	Reasoning
The High Court has examined legal issues while delivering the impugned judgment, of course having regard to the facts which were culled out from the documents on record.	Reasoning
In view of the foregoing, the appeals preferred by the FOWC and Jaypee are dismissed, subject to observations as made above.	Decision
Insofar as the appeal filed by the Commissioner of Income Tax is concerned, it was submitted by Mr. Rohatgi himself that the issue of dependent PE had become academic.	Decision
Therefore, we need not examine this issue and dispose of the appeal of the Revenue accordingly.	Decision
No costs.	None
