Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant submitted that the First Respondent had repeatedly made valiant efforts to wriggle out of the obligations under the PPA.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the First Respondent initially filed a petition for a declaration that the PPA was void.	Arguments of Petitioner
Having failed in that attempt, the First Respondent resorted to issuance of the Termination Notice for delay in payments.10.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Giri urged that the First Respondent should not have been permitted to take a defence justifying the Termination Notice and seeking open access in O.P. No. 37 of 2012, particularly after O.P. No. 48 of 2011 was withdrawn from the State Commission without seeking permission to initiate fresh proceedings.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the withdrawal of O.P. No. 48 of 2011 by the First Respondent before the State Commission would act as a bar under Order 23, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and the Respondent should not be permitted to raise the grounds in O.P. No. 48 of 2011 before any other forum.	Arguments of Petitioner
He placed reliance upon the judgment of this Court in Sarguja Transport Service v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal, MP Gwalior and Ors. reported in (1987)	Arguments of Petitioner
SCC 5, wherein it was held that a fresh Writ Petition was not maintainable after withdrawal of a Writ Petition without permission to file a fresh Petition in respect of the same subject matter.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also submitted that there is no admission of any default in his letter dated 04.07.2011.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any event, according to him, the delay was not inordinate and there was no further delay in making payments after May 2011.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also stated that the First Respondent continued to supply power even after the Termination Notice dated 22.07.2011 which amounts to condoning the default, if there was any, in the payment of earlier bills.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also stated that the interconnection renewal was obtained by the First Respondent on 23.03.2011 and the First Respondent cannot complain of any delay in payments made prior to that date.	None
Mr. Basava Prabhu S. Patil, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the First Respondent submitted that it is clear from the reply to the default notice that the Appellant admitted the delay in payments.	Arguments of Respondent
He stated that the Appellant did not deal with the Letter of Credit at all in the said reply to the default notice.	Arguments of Respondent
He also submitted that the defects were not cured within a period of 30 days, as the payment for the months of Jan 2011 and Feb 2011 which were due on 18.02.2011 and 18.03.2011 were made only on 25.05.2011.	Arguments of Respondent
No interest for the delayed payment was paid as provided for in the agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
A Letter of Credit was not opened even after the default notice.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Patil stated that the interconnection approval was only an excuse for nonpayment and that it was not a condition precedent for payment of tariff invoices.	None
He relied upon an earlier judgment of the APTEL in Appeal No. 152 of 2012.	Arguments of Respondent
Countering the argument of the Appellant on Order 23, Rule 1, Mr. Patil stated that withdrawal of a petition without liberty to file a fresh petition would not bar the First Respondent from taking a defence in another round of litigation.	Arguments of Respondent
He relied upon a judgment of this Court in Kandapazha Nadar Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
v. Chitraganiammal Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
reported in (2007) 7 SCC 65.	Arguments of Respondent
In reply, Mr. Giri submitted that no time limit is prescribed for payment of bills in Article 9.2.2.	Arguments of Petitioner
Letters of Credit would not fall within the purview of the words payments default in Clause 9.2.2.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also submitted that the right to terminate the contract ought not to have been exercised by the First Respondent for nonopening of a Letter of Credit which was not a fundamental default of the conditions of the PPA.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further stated that the Appellant is a public utility and any order against the Appellant would have a huge impact on public revenue.	Arguments of Petitioner
The point for determination in the present appeal pertains to the validity of the Termination Notice dated 22.07.2011 and the entitlement of the Appellant to seek a declaration that the PPA is valid and binding on Respondent No.1.	Issue
It would be necessary to examine the relevant Articles in the PPA for a proper adjudication of the lis in this case.	None
Article 6.3 of the PPA provides for payment of penal interest at the rate of SBI Medium Term Lending Rate per annum in case of delay in payment by the Appellant.	None

Upon delivery of the Termination Notice this Agreement shall stand terminated and Company shall stand discharged of its obligations.	None

The said Article also provides for the First Respondent being permitted to sell electricity to third parties in the event of payment default by the appellant for a continuous period of three months.	None
The procedure prescribed in Article 9.3.2 for termination for the Appellants default is that the First Respondent should deliver a Default Notice giving details in the event of default and asking the Appellant to remedy the same.	None
If the Appellant does not remedy the defaults within the prescribed period of 30 days or any extended period as mutually agreed upon, the First Respondent may issue a Termination Notice.	None
The Default Notice dated 26.05.2011 refers to default in payments of bills, nonpayment of interest for the delayed payments and nonopening of a Letter of Credit as provided for in Article 6.5 of the Agreement.	None
In the reply dated 04.07.2011, the Appellant did not expressly deal with any of the defaults mentioned in the Default Notice.	None
On the other hand the Appellant stated that it relied heavily on Government subsidy for payment to be made, an attempt would be made in the future to make payments promptly, LCs would be opened and that payment for January, February and March 2011 were delayed because the approval for interconnection was given only on 23.06.2011.	None

Admittedly, interest on the delayed payments as provided for in Article 6 was not paid and a Letter of Credit was not opened.	None
In view of the default mentioned by the First Respondent in the notice not being remedied within a period of 30 days, we are of the opinion that the Second Respondent Commission and the APTEL were correct in upholding the termination notice dated22.07.2011.	None
We do not agree with the submissions of Mr. Giri that nonopening of Letter of Credit would not be a default covered by Article 9.2.2.	None
As per Article 9.2.1, a failure or refusal by the Appellant to perform its financial and other material obligations under a PPA constitutes an event of default.	None
Both the parties to the PPA are bound by the terms thereof and they are free to resort to action in accordance with the provisions contained therein.	None
This Court in Sarguja Transport Service (supra) held that withdrawal of a Writ Petition without seeking permission to file a fresh Writ Petition would bar filing of a fresh Writ Petition.	Reasoning
But there is no bar for taking a defence in a fresh round of litigation in respect of the same point involved in a suit which was withdrawn without seeking liberty.	Reasoning
(See Kandapazha Nadar, (supra).	Reasoning
The First Respondent initially sought for open access for sale of electricity to third parties intrastate by filing O.P. No. 48 of 2011.	Reasoning
After withdrawing O.P. No. 48 of 2011, the First Respondent filed a Petition before the CERC for interstate open access.	Reasoning
It is no doubt true that in O.P. No. 48 of 2011, the First Respondent also sought for a relief of a declaration that the PPA is not binding on it.	Reasoning
Strictly speaking, there was no need for such a declaration being sought by the First Respondent as the PPA was terminated by issuance of a notice dated 22.07.2011.	Reasoning
In any event, we are at present concerned with O.P.No.37 of 2012 in which the First Respondent raised a defence that Termination Notice was valid and that it was entitled to open access, which is legally permissible.17.	Reasoning
The APTEL found that the grant of interconnection approval on 26.03.2011 could not be a justification for delayed payment of bills.	None
It was held that there was delay in payment of bills for January and February 2011 even after the interconnection approval was given on 23.03.2011, as admittedly the payments were made only on 26.05.2011.	None
The APTEL relied upon an earlier order passed by it in Appeal No.152 of 2012	Reasoning
M s. Soham Manipatlu Power Pvt. Ltd. v. Karnataka Power Transmission Corp.	Reasoning
Ors.	Reasoning
(decided on 12.02.2014) to hold that an interconnection approval was not a condition precedent for payment of tariff invoices.	None
We approve the above findings recorded by the APTEL.18.	Reasoning
It is an admitted fact that the First Respondent continued to supply power to the Appellant on payment of L 2.80 per unit even after the notice of termination dated 22.07.2011.	Reasoning
There was a refusal of open access to the First Respondent in the pending proceedings.	Reasoning
There was also an interim order for maintenance of status quo in O.P.No.37 of 2012 by the Second Respondent Commission.	Reasoning
In view of the fact that the power was being generated by the First Respondent and had to be supplied, the continuation of the supply made by the First Respondent after the Termination Notice dated 22.07.2011 cannot be taken to be a condonation of the events of default by the Appellant.19.	Reasoning
In view of the foregoing, we do not find any error in the judgment of the APTEL confirming the Order of the Second Respondent Commission.	Decision
The Civil Appeal is dismissed.	Decision
No order as to costs.	Decision
