In the meeting of the Council, respondent No. 2, on April 16, 1979, Shri P. N.

On getting no favorable response from respondent No. 3 the petitioner tried to approach the other members of the Council to indicate his resentment at the alleged illegality and arbitrariness in the appointment of respondent No. 4.	None
The petitioner addressed a letter to Shri N. Srinivasan, Secretary to respondent No. 2, wherein he referred to the circular dated August 4, 1979 which he had received intimating him about the appointment of respondent No. 4 as Director of respondent No. 1.	None
By this letter the petitioner pointed out to the Secretary that the appointing authority had not observed the rules and regulations and bye laws of the Institute as laid down in the memorandum of association and had also violated the provisions of Art.14 and 16 of the Constitution.	None
He also pointed out that the vacancy of the post of Director had not been publicised and he being the seniormost researcher working as Distinguished Scientist of the Institute was not given an opportunity to apply for the same.	None
He also pointed out the arbitrary manner in which the appointment of respondent No. 4 had been made, and he urged the Institute to rectify the error failing which he might be obliged to take legal action.	None
The petitioner likewise addressed a letter to another member of the Council, Prof. R. P. Bambah, who was a Professor of Mathematics in the Center for Advanced Studies, Punjab University and was one of the two Scientists coopted by the Council.	None
The petitioner in his letter of Prof. Bambah complained that with the appointment of respondent No. 4 to the Directorship and his simultaneous designation to the post of Distinguished Scientist, the Council had subverted the academic standards of the Institute and violated the rules and regulations as contained in the memorandum of association as also the various provisions of the Constitution.	None
Further, the appointment was arbitrary inasmuch as it was without any regard to the claims of senior and better known professional persons.	None
He appealed to Prof. Bambah to uphold the academic integrity of the Institute and initiate corrective action to rectify the wrong and rescue the Institute from manipulations of unprincipled people.	None
A similar letter was addressed by the petitioner to Shri S. C. Bhattacharya, Director, Bose Institute, Calcutta, on August 31, 1979, another member of the Governing Council of respondent No. 1, who was one of the four representatives of the Indian National Science Academy.	None

It may be pointed out that the members of the selection committee and the members of the Council are all men of eminence and highly qualified persons.12.	None
Prof. S. C. Bhattacharya by his letter dated September 5, 1979 replied that the contents of the petitioners letter were disquieting.	None
He also stated that respondent No. 4 had been identified as a suitable person by a group of eminent people and on the basis of advice received from them the Council, respondent No. 2, had approved the appointment of respondent No. 4.	None
He further stated that he was not making any further comments in the matter at this stage.	None
He was unaware of respondent No. 4 having been designated as Distinguished Scientist by the Council in the meeting of August 3, 1979.	None
Regarding appointment he further said that no report of the selection committee had been circulated to the members of the Council but the announcement was made orally by the Chairman.	None
Since it was difficult to hear every word of the Chairman at the meeting he had assumed that the terms of appointment would be those ordinarily prescribed for the post of Director.13.	None
Prof. Sukhatme in his reply said that he had not realised the grave issues which such an appointment could raise.	None
He wanted, however, to assure that there was no intention on their part to subvert the academic standards of the Institute.	None
He assured the petitioner that he would be writing to the Secretary of the Council to know what was the procedure for appointing a person to the post of Distinguished Scientist and whether the same should have been explained to the Council before adopting the resolution.14.	None
Prof. R. P. Bambah on September 22, 1979 wrote a letter to Shri P. N. Haksar submitting his resignation presumably in protest against what had happened in regard to the appointment of respondent No. 4 as the Director of the Institute.	None
In his letter he stated that he had not received any official biodata or information regarding the scientific contribution of respondent No. 4 and other available candidates for the post of Director to enable him to form his own judgment.	None
He said that he presumed that the scientific contribution of respondent No. 4 must have been high enough to warrant his holding the post of Distinguished Scientist.	None
He also expressed the view that since the committee consisted of eminent scientists working under his guidance, he had presumed that all relevant factors had been taken into consideration regarding the appointment to the post of Director, including the quality of candidates scientific contribution, in coming to a decision.	None
In the circumstances he was constrained to resign from the Council since he had not displayed due diligence in the performance of his function as member of the Council.15.	None
The petitioner likewise received a letter from the Chairman in which he did not deny the allegation contained in the petitioners letter dated August 13, 1979 that the vacancy in the post of Director of respondent No. 1 had not been publicised.16.	None
Another meeting of the Council was held on October 19, 1979 and in this meeting Prof. Raja Ramanna, Dr. S. C. Bhattacharya and Dr. P. V. Sukhatme were not present and Dr. Bambah had resigned on September 22, 1979.	None
Nonetheless, the proceedings of the meeting of October 19, 1979 do not allude to Dr. Bambahs resignation.	None
In this meeting the letter of the petitioner was considered, copies of which had been circulated to the members earlier and the Council decided that no action was necessary in the matter.17.	None
Shri V. M. Tarkunde appearing for the petitioner challenges the appointment of respondent No. 4 on various grounds 1.	None
(a) Bye law 2 expressly requires that the vacancy of the Directorship should be suitably publicised but in the present case no publicity whatsoever was given to the vacancy of Directorship.(b) Even apart from the bye law, publicity was necessary if the appointment was to be fair and free from partiality.(c)	Arguments of Petitioner
The petitioner and many others like him were not aware of the vacancy of the post of Director till the actual order of appointment of respondent No. 4 was made.2.	Arguments of Petitioner
The petitioner was eminently suitable for being appointed to the post of Director keeping in view his various contributions in the field of his work and the active part played by him in resolving the administrative problems of the Institute.3.	Arguments of Petitioner
No biodata or information was placed before the Council which under the bye laws was the appointing authority of the Director to enable the members to gauge the comparative suitability of various candidates for the post of Director.	None
No facts relating to the other candidates were presented before the selection committee by the Chairman.	Arguments of Petitioner
As such there was no application of mind by the members of the Council, since no report was circulated regarding the recommendation of the selection committee, and the members of the Council took it for granted that all was well.18.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri R. K. Garg appearing for respondents Nos. 1 and 2 resisted the petition on the following grounds (i) That the petition is not maintainable under Art.32 of the Constitution as respondents Nos. 1 and 2 are not state or other authority within the meaning of Art.12 of the Constitution.(ii)(a) Even assuming, though not conceding, that there has been a violation of bye law 2 no writ can lie to correct the same as the alleged bye law has no statutory basis inasmuch as by the Indian Statistical Institute Act, 1959 Parliament only declared the Indian Statistical Institute, respondent No. 1 as an institution of national importance and if it has made bye law 2 for its guidance, such bye law cannot be said to have any statutory force.(b)	None
The bye laws not being statutory the respondents are under no obligation to observe the procedure laid down in the bye laws.(iii)	None
In any case the petitioner was duly and properly considered for selection to the post of Director and, therefore, he could not possibly make any grievance about violation of bye law 2.19.	None
In view of the contentions raised by the counsel for the parties the first question that falls to be considered is whether the writ petition is maintainable.20.	None
Art.12 of the Constitution defines State for the purposes of Part III of the Constitution.	None
It reads 12.	None
In this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the State includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.21.	None
The learned counsel for the petitioner, Shri Tarkunde has contended that having regard to the provisions of the Act and the memorandum of association, the composition of respondent No. 1 is dominated by the representatives appointed by the Central Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
The money required for running the Institute is provided entirely by the Central Government and even if any other moneys are to be received by the Institute it can be done only with the approval of the Central Government, and the accounts of the Institute have also to be submitted to the Central Government for its scrutiny and satisfaction.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Society has to comply with all such directions as may be issued by the Central Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
The control of the Central Government is deep and pervasive and, therefore, to all intents and purposes, it is an instrumentality of the Central Government and as such is an authority within the meaning of Art.12 of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is, therefore, subject to the constitutional obligations under Art.14 and 16 of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance was placed upon Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi 1981 (1) SCC 722 1981 SCC (LS) 258 AIR 1981 SC 487 (1981) 1 LLJ 103.	None
The Constitution Bench in that case took the view that the expression other authorities in Art.12 must be given a broad and liberal interpretation, where constitutional fundamentals vital to the maintenance of human rights are at stake and functional realism and not facial cosmetics must be the diagnostic tool, for constitutional law must seek the substance and not the form.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Court pointed out that the Government may act through the instrumentality or agency of juridical persons to carry out its functions, since, with the advent of the welfare State, its new tasks have increased manifold and such juridical persons acting as the instrumentality or agency of the Government must therefore be subject to the same discipline of fundamental rights as the State.	Arguments of Petitioner
Proceeding further the Court observed It is undoubtedly true that the corporation is a distinct juristic entity with a corporate structure of its own and it carries on its functions on business principles with a certain amount of autonomy which is necessary as well as useful from the point of view of effective business management, but behind the formal ownership which is cast in the corporate mould, the reality is very much the deeply pervasive presence of the government.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is really the government which acts through the instrumentality or agency of the corporation and the juristic veil of corporate personality worn for the purpose of convenience of management and administration cannot be allowed to obliterate the true nature of the reality behind which is the government.	None
Now it is obvious that if a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the government, it must be subject to the same limitations in the field of constitutional law as the government itself, though in the eye of the law it would be a distinct and independent legal entity.	None
If the government acting through its officers is subject to certain constitutional limitations, it must follow a fortiorari that the government acting through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation should equally be subject to the same limitations.	Arguments of Petitioner
If such a corporation were to be free from the basic obligation to obey the Fundamental Rights, it would lead to considerable erosion of the efficiency of the Fundamental Rights, for in that event the government would be enabled to override the fundamental rights by adopting the stratagem of carrying out its functions through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation, while retaining control over it.22.	Arguments of Petitioner
Having regard to this decision and in view of the facts and circumstances in the present case there can be no doubt that respondent No. 2 is an authority within the meaning of Art.12 of the Constitution and, therefore, the writ petition filed by the petitioner is competent and maintainable and the objection raised by Shri Garg cannot be accepted.23.	Reasoning
The next question that arises for consideration is whether the appointment of respondent No. 4 as Director of respondent No. 1 is illegal because of noncompliance with bye law 2.	None
Bye law 2 does require that before appointment, the vacancy in the post of Director should be suitably publicised.	None
In the instant case, it is admitted on both sides that no publicity whatsoever was given in respect of the vacancy.	None
The contention of Shri Garg, however, is that the bye law having no force of statute, noncompliance with its requirement cannot in any way affect the appointment of respondent No. 4 as Director of respondent No. 1.	None
Shri Tarkunde, however, contended that assuming that the bye law is not statutory, even so respondent No. 1 was bound to comply with it.	Reasoning
In support of his contention he strongly relied upon Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India (1979) 3	None
SCR 1014 (1979) 3 SCC 489 AIR 1979 SC 1628 (1979) 2 LLJ 217 .	None
The Court in that case held (SCC p. 503, para 10)It is a well settled rule of administrative law that an executive authority must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its actions to be judged and it must scrupulously observe those standards on pain of invalidation of an act in violation of them.	None
This rule was enunciated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Vitarelli v. Seaton 359 US 535 3 LEd 2d 1012 (1959) where the learned Judge said An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged Accordingly, if dismissal from employment is based on a defined procedure, even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency, that procedure must be scrupulously observed This judicially evolved rule of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I may add, rightly so.	None
He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with the sword.	None
The aforesaid principle laid down by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Vitarelli v. Seaton 359 US 535 3 LEd 2d 1012 (1959) has been accepted as applicable in India by this Court in Amarjit Singh Ahluwalia V. State of Punjab (1975) 3	None
SCR 82 (1975) 3 SCC 503 1975 SCC (LS) 27 AIR 1975 SC 984 (1975) 1 LLJ 228 and in subsequent decision given in Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi (1975)	None
3 SCR 619 (1975) 1 SCC 421 1975 SCC (LS) 101 AIR 1975 SC 1331 (1975) 1 LLJ 399 .	None
Mathew, J. quoted the above referred observation of Mr. Justice Frankfurter with approval.24.	None
In view of the pronouncement of this Court on the point it must be held to be obligatory on the part of respondent No. 1 to follow the bye laws, if the bye laws have been framed for the conduct of its affairs to avoid arbitrariness.	None
Respondent No. 1 cannot, therefore, escape the liability for not following the procedure prescribed by bye law 2.25.	Reasoning
Compliance with this bye law also seems to be necessary in the name of fairplay.	None
If the vacancy in the post of Director had been publicised as contemplated by bye law 2, all the persons eligible for the post may have applied and in that case, the field of consideration would have been enlarged and the selection committee or the Council would have had a much larger field from which to choose the best available person and that would have removed all doubts of arbitrariness from the mind of those eligible for the post.	Reasoning
Of course, we do not wish to suggest for a moment that appointment to every post must be made only after advertising or publicising the vacancy.	None
That would not be right, for there are quite a few posts at the top level which cannot be and should not be advertised or publicised, because they are posts for which there should be no lobbying nor should any applications be allowed to be entertained.	None
Examples of such posts may be found in the post of Commander of Armed Forces or the Chief Justice or the Judges of the Supreme Court or the High Courts.	None
But here bye law 2 requires that the vacancy in the post of Director should be publicised and hence we are making the above observation in this paragraph.26.	None
The grievance of the petitioner is that he has not been considered for appointment to the post of Director although he is far superior to respondent No. 4.	Reasoning
If there had been due publicity as required by bye law 2, he and many others like him would have applied for the post.	Reasoning
Shri Garg, however, contends for respondent No. 1 that the petitioner can have no grievance as his case was duly considered as stated clearly in the affidavit of respondent No. 3, Shri P. N. Haksar, Chairman of the Council.	Reasoning
We accept the statement of respondent No. 3 that the case of the petitioner was considered by the selection committee but it is a little unfortunate that there is no written report by the selection committee for consideration by the Council.	Reasoning
No minutes of the proceedings before the selection committee have been maintained and none were circulated amongst the members of the Council along with the agenda of the meeting nor were any such minutes placed before the Council meeting when the name of respondent No. 4 was approved by the Council.	Reasoning
There is also nothing on record to show that the Council was at any time informed as to what names had been considered by the selection committee or that the name of the petitioner had been considered but respondent No. 4 was found superior.	Reasoning
It is always desirable that in public bodies the minutes of the proceedings regarding selection should be properly maintained in order to obviate any suspicion or doubt and such minutes along with the relevant documents should be placed before the final authority entrusted with the task of selection for appointment.27.	Reasoning
A lot of argument has been advanced by Shri Tarkunde that the achievements and accomplishments of the petitioner were much higher than those of respondent No. 4.	Reasoning
His contribution in the matter of research had won him high praise.	Reasoning
He had written articles and books of great merit.	Reasoning
On the other hand the achievements or accomplishments of respondent No. 4 were much lower when compared to those of the petitioner.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, it is not for the Court to determine who is the superior of the two candidates and who should be selected.	Reasoning
It is for the authorities concerned to select from amongst the available candidates.	Reasoning
The members of the selection committee as also the members of the Council were eminent persons and they may be presumed to have taken into account all relevant considerations before coming to a conclusion.	Reasoning
But the real difficulty is that in the absence of publicity as contemplated by bye law 2, it cannot be said that all other qualified persons like the petitioner were also considered by the selection committee for appointment, in the absence of any application by them for the post or any recommendation of them by any other authority or individual.28.	Reasoning
Shri Garg, however, contends that the office of the Director is a very high office and this honour is conferred and not demanded and an application for this office from the candidates was not at all necessary as in the case of the Judges of the Supreme Court, High Courts and other constitutional posts of Comptroller and Auditor General of India etc.	Arguments of Respondent
The selection committee composed of eminent scientists of high reputation must be knowing about the reputed men in the field of statistics and it is expected that they must have considered the case of those persons also.29.	Arguments of Respondent
For reasons we have already indicated, we find no force in this contention.	Reasoning
There is no provision for publicity in case of the constitutional posts of the Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts and Comptroller and Auditor General of India.	Reasoning
Rather in the very nature of things, they cannot be and are not publicised.	Reasoning
But in the case of appointment of a Director, bye law 2 clearly provides for publicity and it can only be with the object that all concerned may know about the vacancy and either applications or recommendations may be made for the post and the names of the eligible candidates may be brought before the selection committee for its consideration.	Reasoning
In the state of the record before us it is not possible to say that the members of the Council considered the case of the petitioner and other candidates like him before approving the appointment of respondent No. 4.	Reasoning
It is true that the members of the selection committee and those of the Council were experts in their respective subjects and were eminent scientists and we must proceed on the basis that they acted in all fairness and no oblique motive can be attributed to them.	Reasoning
Indeed Shri Tarkunde did not allege any mala fides against the members of the selection committee or the members of the Council.30.	None
On the admitted position, no publicity in regard to the vacancy was done at all.	None
No information about it was published even on the notice board kept in the various branches of respondent No. 1 at Calcutta and other places.	Reasoning
Nor was the information published in the journal of respondent No. 1.	Reasoning
There was clearly a breach of bye law 2 in making appointment of respondent No. 4 and there was no adequate material before the Council on the basis of which the members could apply their mind for determining as to whether they should approve the recommendation of the selection committee in regard to appointment of respondent No. 4.31.	Reasoning
For the foregoing reasons the writ petition must succeed.	Decision
