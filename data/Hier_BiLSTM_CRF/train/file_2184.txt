ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.1.	None
Appellant calls in question legality of the judgment rendered by Customs, Excise Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, Calcutta (in short the CEGAT).	Issue
Initially there was a difference of opinion between two Members i.e. Technical Member and the Judicial Member and the matter was referred to a third member.	Issue
The third member agreed with the Technical Member and by majority the decision went against the assesseeappellant.	Issue
The judgment is reported in 2000 (123) ELT 789 Tribunal (Castrol (India Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, CalcuttaI).	Issue
The factual position in a nutshell is as followsThe appellant is engaged, inter alia, in the manufacture of blended or compounded lubricating oils.	Facts
It also processes a product called Super TT which the appellant claimed to be a blended lubricating oil ordinarily used for lubrication.	Facts
The undisputed process of manufacture of the said product as stated by the appellant is as under Base Oils are taken to the blending kettle, heated to remove moisture.	Facts
Additives are added and mixed well.	Facts
Temperature reduced and MTO and green dye added and mixed well, to get the final product.	Facts
Admittedly, the flash point of the Super TT is below 94C Therefore, assessee appellant claimed that the same is not classifiable under Heading 2710.60 of the Tariff under Customs Tariff Act, 1985 ( in short the Tariff Act) as the same covers lubricating oils having flash point more than 94oC. As such, the product was claimed to be classifiable as others under subheading 2710.99.	Facts
Revenue disputed the position and held that the benefit of the Exemption Notification No.120/84CE dated 11.5.1984 is applicable only to the lubricating oils falling under subheading 2710.60, as there is no other heading for lubricating oil in the Tariff Act.	Facts
The appellants stand was that the said Exemption Notification extends the benefit to all types of lubricating oils, irrespective of their classification.	Facts
As its product is admittedly a lubricating oil, the scope of the Notification cannot be restricted to the lubricating oils falling under a particular tariff entry.4.	Facts
Two showcause notices issued related to demand of duty against the assessee in respect of their blended Super TT which was cleared at nil rate of duty during different periods.	Facts
The said notices culminated into two different orders whereby proposed amount of duty and personal penalty were confirmed.	Facts
The dates of showcause notices, the period involved, the duty demanded and the penalty demanded are as follows Sl.	None

Assessee preferred two appeals before the CEGAT.	Facts
It was submitted that for a long time Exemption Notification dated 16.3.1976 in relation to Item no.11B and the rate of duty was nil was held applicable to it.	Facts
The Entry 11B was repealed in the year 1984 and it became a part of Item 68.	Facts
Thereafter Notification no.120/84 covered the field and the same notification continued upto 1994.	Facts
In between the Tariff Act was introduced which introduced a new tariff in Chapter 27 w.e.f. 1.3.1986 under the Tariff Act.	Facts
Section 5A(4) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (in short the Act) all along held th field.	Facts
Originally Item No.11B was a part of the First Schedule of the Act.	Facts
Prior to introduction of Section 5A(4) in the Act w.e.f 19.5.1988 Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 (in short the Rules) provided for exemption.	Facts
The Notification No.120/84CE was issued on 11.5.1984 when the earlier Excise Tariff was a part of the First Schedule of the Act.	Facts
The said notification exempted blended and compounded lubricating oils i.e. lubricating oils obtained by straight blending of mineral oils or by blending or compounding of mineral oils with other ingredients.	Facts
The said exemption was granted without reference to any tariff item under which such blended and compounded lubricating oils were classified.	Facts
The new Excise tariff contained in the Tariff Act came into force w.e.f. February 1986.	Facts
Under that Tariff, blended or compounded lubricating oils with flash point above 94oC were classifiable under subhearing 2710.60 and other lubricating oils along with other petroleum products were classified under Chapter subheading 2710.99 which was a residuary entry.	Facts
The Exemption Notification No.120/84CE continued unamended till it was rescinded by Notification No.64/94CE dated 1.3.1994.	Facts
Three classification lists were filed by the appellant which were operative from 1.4.1986, 5.5.1996 and 1.3.1998.	Facts
All these classification lists were approved by Assistant Commissioner by extending the benefit of Notification No.120/84.	Facts
The classification list dated 18.3.1988 was operative for the relevant period under dispute.	Facts
Since product was having flash point below 94C , therefore, there was no question of any suppression as alleged by the Department.	Facts
It was further submitted that the notices were issued after prescribed period of limitation.6.	Facts
The assesseeappellants stand was resisted by the Revenue on the ground that the assesseeappellant had given description of its product to claim benefit under Notification No.120/84 CE.	Facts
Its product was not classifiable under Heading 2710.60 Wrong claiming of benefit establishes mala fide intention and, therefore, the extended period of limitation was rightly invoked by the Department.	Facts
There is specific and unambiguous definition of lubricating oil under Chapter Heading 2710.60 of Chapter 27.	Facts
Chapter Heading 27.10 covers a number of petroleum products and each category is further covered under a separate subheading.	Facts
Subheading 60 covers lubricating oil and there is no other subheading covering lubricating oils.	Facts
When the exemption notification granted exemption it necessarily means that lubricating oil falling under said subheading alone was covered.7.	Facts
While the Judicial Member accepted the stand of the assesseeappellant, the Technical Member took the view that for the purpose of Exemption Notification No.120/84CE lubricating oil for flash point below 94C cease to be lubricating oil as it acquires general description others under subheading 2710.99.	Facts
Therefore, the Departments view was accepted.	Facts
With the similar observations the third member concurred with the member technical and upheld the Departments stand.8.	Facts
In support of the appeal, Mr. Joseph Vellapally, learned senior counsel submitted that the two members constituting the majority lost sight of the fact that there may be lubricating oils having flash point 94C which may be classified under Tariff subheading 2710.99 as others.	Arguments of Petitioner
The view of the majority that lubricating oil has been defined in a particular manner under heading 2710.60 is apparently erroneous.9.	Arguments of Petitioner
In response, Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned Additional Solicitor Genera submitted that the Exemption Notification has to be strictly construed and the view taken by the majority of the members is on a proper reading of the various provisions and the Notifications.	Arguments of Respondent
It was be relevant to take note of the entries and relevant Notifications at different points of time.	None
The notification dated 16.3.1976 read as follows The Central Government has exempted the excisable goods of the description in column (3) of the Table below and falling under the Item of the First Schedule to the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944), specified in the corresponding entries in column (2) of the said Table, from so much of the duty of excise leviable thereon under Section 3 of said Act as is in excess of the duty leviable at the rates specified in the corresponding entries in column (4) of the said TableS.No.	None

G.S.R. 354(E)  	None
In exercise of the powers conferred by subrule (1) of rule 8 of the Central Excise, 1944, the Central Government hereby exempts blended or compounded lubricating oils and greases, that is to say lubricating oils and greases obtained by straight blending of mineral oils or by blending or compounding of mineral oils with any other ingredients, from the whole of the duty of excise leviable thereon under Section 3 of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 (1 of 1944).Explanation  	None

In Collector of Customs, Bangalore vs. Maestro Motors Ltd. (2004 (174) ELT 289 (SC) , this Court held as follows It is settled law that to avail the benefit of a notification a party must comply with tall the conditions of the Notification.	None
Further, a Notification has to be interpreted in terms of its language.	None
If in the Notification exemption is granted with reference to tariff items in the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, then the same Rules of Interpretation must apply.	None
In that case the goods will be classified, even for the purposes of the Notification, as they are classified for purposes of payment of duty.	None
But where the language is plain and clear effect must be given to it.	None
In this Notification what is exempted is components, including components of fuel efficient motor cars in semiknocked down packs and completely knocked down packs.	None
Undoubtedly, for purposes of levy of custom duty, by virtue of Interpretative Rule 2(a), the components in a completely knocked down pack would be considered to be cars.	None
But in view of the clear language of the Notification the components including components in completely knocked down packs are exempted.	None
Effect must be given to the wording of the Notification.	None
Thus components in completely knocked down packs would get the exemption under this Notification, even though for purposes of classification they may be considered to be cars.	None
Section 5A(4) of the Act reads as under Every notification issued under subrule (1), and every order made under subrule (2) of Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944, and in force immediately before the commencement of the Customs and Central Excise Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987 shall be deemed to have been issued or made under the provisions of this Section and shall continue to have the same force and effect after such commencement until it is amended, varied, rescinded or superseded under the provisions of this Section.	None
Undisputedly in the present case there was no reference to any tariff entry in the Notification.	Reasoning
Therefore, the majority view is clearly unsustainable.	Reasoning
Additionally, we find that CEGAT had in some other cases taken the same view as the minority view.	Reasoning
It is fairly accepted by learned Additional Solicitor General that there has been no challenge to the said decisions one of which is Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, KolkataI (2003 (154)	Reasoning
ELT 698 (Tri Kolkata) decided on 30.10.2002.14.	Reasoning
Exemption Notification 120/84CE dated 11.5.1984, in view of what is prescribed in Section 5A(4) of the Act, continued to be operative and effective as it was not amended, varied, rescinded or superseded under the provisions of Section 5A of the Act.15.	Reasoning
In Strouds Judicial Dictionary, 4th Edition, Vol.5, at page 2753, we find That is to say is the commencement of an ancillary clauses, which explains the meaning of the principal clause.	Reasoning
It has the following properties (1) it must not be contrary to the principal clause (2) it must neither increase nor diminish it (3) but where the physical clause is general in terms it may restrict it see this explained with many examples, Stukeley vs. Butler Hob. 1971.	Reasoning
The quotation, given above, from Strouds Judicial Dictionary shows that, ordinarily the expression that is to say is employed to make clear and fix the meaning of what is to be explained or defined.	Reasoning
Such words are not used as a rule, to amplify a meaning while removing a possible doubt for which purpose the word includes is generally employed.	Reasoning
In unusual cases, depending upon the context of the words that is to say, this expression may be followed by illustrative instances.	Reasoning
(See State of T.N. vs. Pyare Lal Malhotra (1976 (1) SCC 834 ), Mahindra Engineering and Chemical Products Ltd. vs. Union of India (1992(1) SCC 727)	Reasoning
Sait Rikhaji Furtarnal vs. State of A.P. (1991 Supp (1) SCC 202) and R. Dalmia vs. C.I.T. (1977 (2) SCC 467 ).16.	Reasoning
The expression that is to say is descriptive, enumerative and exhaustive and circumstances to a great extent the scope of the entry.	Reasoning
(See Commissioner of Sales Tax, M.P. vs. Popular Trading Company, Ujjain (2000 (5) SCC 511 ).17.	Reasoning
The expression that is to say in subheading 2710.60 has to be interpreted to be words of limitation.	Reasoning
The fact that subheading 2710.60 contains an exclusion clause goes to show that there may be other lubricating oils which may fall in the residuary heading others.18.	Reasoning
The subheading 2710.60 significantly uses two expressions.	Reasoning
They are (i) that is to say and (ii) excluding.	Reasoning
The first expression is used in description, enumerative and exhaustive sense and to a great extent circumstances the scope of the entry.	Reasoning
But the second expression dilutes the pervasiveness by carving out an exception for the purpose of the particular subheading a particular type of lubricating oil.	Reasoning
All other types of lubricating oil are covered by the residuary entry i.e. 2710.99.19.	Reasoning
Under the Notification 120/84CE lubricating oil was exempted without references to any tariff heading subheading.	Decision
Consequently, the criteria specified in the Notification were satisfied.	Decision
That being so, majority view contained in the order of the CEGAT is not sustainable and is set aside.	Decision
The minority view as expressed is confirmed.20.	Decision
The appeals are allowed with no order as to costs.	Decision
