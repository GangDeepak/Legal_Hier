A Regular case is, therefore, registered and entrusted to Shri Pramod Kumar, Dy. Supdt. of police CBI, ACI, New Delhi Supdt. of Police, CBI ACI, New Delhi for investigation and report.	None
As aforesaid, the appellant filed writ petition for quashing of the said FIR on the ground that it does not disclose any criminal offence against the appellant and for a declaration that it has been lodged against the appellant (a State Government employee), without prior permission of the State Government and was thus in violation of Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 (for short, the 1946 Act).	Facts
In other words, the FIR has been registered without jurisdiction and is void ab initio.	Facts
The High Court after considering the grounds of challenge, proceeded to hold that BRBCL is an affiliate or associate in relation to National Thermal Power Company (NTPC) Ltd. and the Railways respectively.	Facts
The registered office of BRBCL was in the Union Territory of Delhi (National Capital Territory of Delhi) and the allegation regarding defrauding the said undertaking (BRBCL) and siphoning of funds had occurred in the Union Territory of Delhi (National Capital Territory of Delhi).	Facts
The funds for implementation of the project through BRBCL were provided by the Central Government in terms of the Union Budget proposed in the year 200506.	Facts
The High Court then concluded that criminal conspiracy for committing the offence was thus hatched at Delhi and for all these reasons, the CBI was competent to register FIR at Delhi and to carry on investigation in that regard.	Facts
Additionally, the High Court referred to the notification dated 19.2.1996 issued by the State Government of Bihar according consent to all members of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (for short, the DSPE) to exercise powers and jurisdiction under the 1946 Act in the whole of the State of Bihar in respect of the stated offences.

The High Court negatived the argument of the appellant that the proviso in the said notification restricted the general consent accorded by the State.	Facts
It was urged by the appellant that the purport of the proviso was to make it amply clear that no consent was given by the State Government in terms of Section 6 of the 1946 Act to authorise the members of the DSPE to exercise powers and jurisdiction under the 1946 Act in respect of offences in which public servants employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar were allegedly involved.	Facts
Investigation in respect of such cases could be undertaken only after taking prior consent of the State Government of Bihar and not otherwise.	Facts
The High Court noted that it was not the case of the appellant that the offences referred to in the subject FIR were not covered by the notification issued by the Central Government in terms of Section 3 of the 1946 Act.	Facts
The High Court held that the investigation in the present case had begun in respect of affairs of an agent of a public sector undertaking and the Central Government through Ministry of Railways with regard to siphoning of funds by the agent entering into a criminal conspiracy with some persons who incidentally reside outside the Union Territory.	Facts
Investigation qua them could be proceeded by the CBI without the consent of the concerned State Government where the coaccused resided.	Facts
The High Court in paragraphs 46 and 48 noted thus  Once the offences or the classes of offences are covered under the notification issued by the Central Government in terms of Section 3 and the offences alleged are said to be in respect of the funds of the government being siphoned through its agent which is a corporate body and a government company through its Chief Executive Officer and the registered office of the said corporate body is in the Union Territory of Delhi, the institution of the FIR as well as the investigation taken up pursuant thereto cannot be stopped and no consent of the government of Bihar would be required to investigate the persons involved in commission of the offence.	Facts
Such person may be an officer working in connection with the affairs of the State of Bihar, but where the offences alleged are in connection with the funds of the Government of India through its agent a government company having its registered office at Union Territory of Delhi, it would be immaterial that any other person involved in commission of the said offence is working in connection with the affairs of the State Government.	Facts
In the facts of the present case, this Court is of the considered opinion that no consent of the State Government in terms of Section 6 of the DSPE Act, 1946 would be required.	Facts

Even though learned Senior counsel representing the petitioner submits that in the present case the B.R.B.C.L. cannot be said to be a company owned or controlled by the Central Government, this Court is of the considered opinion that first part of the notification dated 19.02.1996 in so far as it states that the consent of the government is in respect of the investigation of the offence committed in connection with the affairs of the Government of India, local authority subject to the control of the Government of India, local authority subject to the control of the Government of India or any Corporation, Company or Bank owned and controlled by the Government of India cannot be given a narrow meaning.	Facts
While dealing with the proviso in the subject notification dated 19.2.1996, the High Court in paragraphs 57 and 58 observed thus The proviso to the notification dated 19.02.1996 issued by the Government of Bihar cannot come to the rescue of the petitioner in the present set of facts and circumstances where the C.B.I. while investigating a case involving a government company who is acting as an agent of the public sector undertaking and Ministry of Railways finds that some more persons including those who are public servants presently working and serving under the Government of Bihar are also involved in the conspiracy which has an ultimate effect of causing unlawful loss to the principal for which the agent is working, no individual consent would be required in terms of Section 6 of the D.S.P.E. Act.	Facts
The contention of the learned Senior Counsel based on the proviso part of the notification dated 19.02.1996 could have been worth consideration if it could have been shown to this Court that the entire alleged offence in respect of which the C.B.I. has assumed jurisdiction to investigate relate to an affairs of the State of Bihar.	Facts
This Court would, therefore, reiterate that in the facts situation of the present case no consent at all would be required from the Government of Bihar.	Facts
The High Court accordingly rejected the challenge put forth by the appellant and dismissed the writ petition being devoid of merit.	None
The appellant has reiterated the grounds urged before the High Court and would contend that CBI could not have registered the FIR much less investigated the same without prior consent of the State of Bihar in that regard.	Arguments of Petitioner
The notification dated 19.2.1996 does not authorise the CBI to register cases against the public servants employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of this submission, reliance has been placed on the decisions in State of West Bengal Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
vs. Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, West Bengal Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2010) 3 SCC 571 , Ms. Mayawati vs. Union of India Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2012) 8 SCC 106 and M. Balakrishna Reddy vs. Director, Central Bureau of Investigation, New Delhi (2008) 4 SCC 409 .	Arguments of Petitioner
It is urged that the interpretation by the High Court regarding the purport of the subject notification dated 19.2.1996 is flawed and, is in teeth of the express stipulation in the proviso thereof.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is urged that any other view would result in impacting the federal structure of the country, which is the basic feature of the Constitution of India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the general consent accorded by the State of Bihar vide stated notification is a conditional one for exercise of powers and jurisdiction by the officials of the DSPE.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant has drawn our attention to the expression may used in Sections 3 and 5 of the 1946 Act in contradistinction to the expression shall in Section 6 and would urge that the requirement of prior unambiguous consent of the State Government is the pre requisite and sine qua non to empower the officials of the DSPE.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant has also pointed out that the nature of allegation in the FIR against the appellant disregards the factual background in which the declaration in favour of Gopal Prasad Singh regarding the land bearing Khata No. 12, Plot number 1 of Mauja Kajrain was issued after due evaluation of his claim in the hierarchy of administrative set up right from Anchal Amin upto Additional District Magistrate, which process went on from 1971 as is manifest from the official record.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is thus urged that the alleged act of the appellant was done in official capacity and was protected by Section 79 of the IPC.	Arguments of Petitioner
The CBI ought to have undertaken preliminary enquiry before rushing to register the FIR on the basis of source information.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even for that reason, the action of CBI cannot be countenanced  not being in conformity with the CBI Manual.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is urged that the FIR does not disclose any offence qua the appellant and that it was registered without offering any explanation for the inordinate delay.	Arguments of Petitioner
Finally, it is urged that the registration of FIR itself was barred by Section 6 of the 1946 Act read with notification dated 19.2.1996.	Arguments of Petitioner
9.	Arguments of Petitioner
The State of Bihar has supported the claim of the appellant on the question of law by contending that Policing is a State subject under Entry 2 List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
Hence, having due regard to the federal structure recognised under the Constitution, provision such as Section 6 of the 1946 Act has been incorporated.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the State, combined reading of Sections 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the 1946 Act would show that DSPE has jurisdiction to investigate offences notified under Section 3 in any Union Territory the use of the expression may in Sections 3 and 5 is indicative that it is only an enabling provision, enabling the Central Government to extend the area of operation of DSPE to any area in the State by an order.	Arguments of Petitioner
The order under Section 5, however, is made subject to the condition predicated in Section 6, namely, it would come into effect only after consent of the concerned State Government is accorded.	Arguments of Petitioner
For, Section 6 uses the expression shall, which is suggestive of the fact that the said requirement is mandatory in nature and without such prior consent of the State, DSPE would not get jurisdiction to enter upon investigation of the specified offences and exercise its powers and jurisdiction in any area of a State.	Arguments of Petitioner
As regards the notification dated 19.2.1996, it is urged by the State that it is a general consent, making it amply clear that prior consent to investigate cases against the public servants employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar is essential.	Arguments of Petitioner
That requirement has not been dispensed with in terms of the proviso in the subject notification.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is always open to the State to accord partial consent on the terms specified in the notification.	Arguments of Petitioner
As the State is variously concerned about the actions of its employees including the subject of Policing being a State subject, it is urged that the DSPE ought to have intimated the State about the acts of commission and omission of the officers of the State, so that the State could have examined the same and resorted to appropriate action as per law.	Arguments of Petitioner
The State is also relying on the exposition in Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights, West Bengal (supra).	Arguments of Petitioner
It is urged by the State that no consent has been obtained by the DSPE in terms of the proviso, although the allegations in the FIR registered by them against the appellant who is a State Government employee are in connection with the affairs of the State.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the CBI has adopted the reasons noted by the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
He has urged that the occupation residence of one of the accused cannot come in the way of DSPE to carry on the investigation in respect of offence of conspiracy to defraud the Government of India undertaking whose registered office is at Delhi and moreso because the siphoning of funds of the undertaking has been committed within the territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
The investigation of such a case cannot be regarded as in respect of an offence independently committed by the public servant employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar as such.	Arguments of Respondent
As a result, no consent of any State to investigate such an office would be necessary.	Arguments of Respondent
As a matter of fact, no State would have jurisdiction to enquire into or investigate the offence committed in relation to the Government of India undertaking registered in the territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
Similarly, only the Courts in Delhi would have jurisdiction to take cognizance of the stated offence.	Arguments of Respondent
In such a situation, the occupation or status of the accused or his residence cannot be the basis to constrict the powers of the investigating agency (DSPE) in any manner.	Arguments of Respondent
It is urged that if the argument of the appellant is accepted, that would have serious implications.	Arguments of Respondent
For, in cases where the DSPE during the course of investigation of specified crimes committed in Union Territory is confronted with the accused employed residing in different States, it would require the DSPE to obtain consent of every such State wherever the accused resides and is an employee of that State.	Arguments of Respondent
That cannot be the intention of law in empowering the special police establishment (DSPE) to investigate specified and notified offences committed within the Union Territory.	Arguments of Respondent
The harmonious and purposive construction of the provisions of the 1946 Act, in particular Section 5 thereof, would be to confine the consent of the State Government under Section 6 in respect of investigation of crime exclusively committed within the jurisdiction of that State.	Arguments of Respondent
In other words, no consent would be required in respect of specified offence(s) committed within the Union Territory, which could be investigated only by the DSPE under Sections 2 and 3 of the 1946 Act throughout India.	Arguments of Respondent
Any other interpretation would render the dispensation regarding investigation of specified offences committed within the Union Territory otiose.	Arguments of Respondent
This is moreso because the State would have no jurisdiction to investigate such offence committed within the jurisdiction of the Union Territory.	Arguments of Respondent
Resultantly, the question of obtaining consent of the State merely because one of the accused involved in the offence happens to be residing in that State or is a public servant of that State, is not contemplated by law.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also urged that the proviso to the subject notification dated 19.2.1996 has the effect of defeating the purpose for which special legislation has been enacted and dispensation thereunder for investigation of specified offences is established.	Arguments of Respondent
Relying on the exposition of the Constitution Bench in Subramanian Swamy vs. Director, Central Bureau of Investigation Anr.	Arguments of Respondent
(2014) 8 SCC 682 , it is urged that the principle underlying the declaration of provisions such as Section 6A of the 1946 Act being ultra vires, must apply to the proviso which is part of notification being an executive instruction classifying offenders differently for treatment thereunder, including investigation of offences and prosecution for offences, according to their status in life on account of being employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar.	Arguments of Respondent
That is impermissible and cannot be countenanced as it defeats the purpose of finding prima facie truth into the allegations of the specified crime, as every person accused of committing the same offence is to be dealt with in the same manner in accordance with law, which is equal in its application to everyone.	Arguments of Respondent
The alleged acts of commission and omission of the appellant in the State of Bihar would not alter the substratum of the offence or crime in question stated to have been committed to defraud the Government undertaking (BRBCL) and resultantly siphoning of its funds within the Union Territory of Delhi (National Capital Territory of Delhi).	Arguments of Respondent
Our attention is also invited by the learned Additional Solicitor General to a recent decision of the Delhi High Court in Anand Agarwal vs. Union of India Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
(2018) SCC Online Del 11713 , which has upheld the stand taken by the CBI that requirement of consent of the State is premised on the basis that the specified offence or offences committed and under investigation, have taken place in the State (outside the Union Territory).	Arguments of Respondent
The Delhi High Court has agreed with the view taken by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in the impugned judgment.	Arguments of Respondent
It is urged that the appeal be dismissed being devoid of merit.	Arguments of Respondent
After cogitating over the rival submissions, the core issue which arises for consideration in the present case is whether the proviso in the stated notification dated 19.2.1996 would come in the way of the officials of DSPE to register FIR and carry on investigation of specified offences committed within the Union Territory (National Capital Territory of Delhi), to which the 1946 Act applies?	Issue
The 1946 Act has been enacted to make provision for constitution of a special police force in Delhi for the investigation of certain offences (committed) in the Union Territories, for the superintendence and administration of the said force and for the extension to other areas of the powers and jurisdiction of the members in regard to the investigation of the said offences.	None
This Act applies to the whole of India.	None
Section 2 of the 1946 Act enables the Central Government to constitute a special force to be called DSPE for the investigation in any Union Territory of specified offences notified under Section 3.	None
Section 3 of the 1946 Act enables the Central Government, by notification in the official gazette to specify the offences or classes of offences which are to be investigated by the DSPE.	None
It is not in dispute that the offences referred to in the subject FIR are so specified by the notification issued under Section 3.	None
The consequence of establishing a special police force under Section 2 is to empower the members of the said police force to exercise all the powers, duties, privileges and liabilities throughout the Union Territory in relation to the investigation of specified offences, which police officers of that Union Territory have in connection with the investigation of offences committed therein.	None
By virtue of subSection (3) of Section 2 of the 1946 Act, any member of the said establishment of or above the rank of SubInspector may, subject to any orders which the Central Government may make in this behalf, exercise in any Union Territory any of the powers of the officer in charge of a police station in the area in which he is for the time being and when so exercising such powers shall, subject to any such orders, be deemed to be an officer in charge of a police station discharging the functions of such an officer within the limits of his station.	None
Resultantly, specified offences committed within the Union Territories are required to be investigated exclusively by the special police force constituted for that purpose.	None
The purport of Section 5 of the 1946 Act is to enable the Central Government to extend the powers and jurisdiction of members of the DSPE for the investigation of any offence or class of offences specified in the notification under Section 3, in a State not being a Union Territory.	None
Such extension of powers and jurisdiction of members of the special police force becomes necessary in respect of specified offences committed outside the jurisdiction of the Union Territory referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of the 1946 Act.	None
However, in keeping with the federal structure of the Constitution which is fundamental to the Constitution, consent of such a State has been made essential, as predicated in Section 6 of the 1946 Act.	None
Sections 5 and 6 of the 1946 Act read thus  Extension of powers and jurisdiction of special police establishment to other areas.(1)	None
The Central Government may by order extend to any area (including Railway areas), in a State, not being a Union territory the powers and jurisdiction of members of the Delhi Special Police Establishment for the investigation of any offences or classes of offences specified in a notification under section 3.	None
When by an order under subsection (1) the powers and jurisdiction of members of the said police establishment are extended to any such area, a member thereof may, subject of any orders which the Central Government may make in this behalf, discharge the functions of a police officer in that area and shall, while so discharging such functions, be deemed to be a member of a police force of that area and be vested with the powers, functions and privileges and be subject to the liabilities of a police officer belonging to that police force.	None
Where any such order under subsection (1) is made in relation to any area, then, without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (2), any member of the Delhi Special Police Establishment of or above the rank of Sub Inspector may, subject to any orders which the Central Government may make in this behalf, exercise the powers of the officer in charge of a police station in that area and when so exercising such powers, shall be deemed to be an officer incharge of a police station discharging the functions of such an officer within the limits of his station.	None
Consent of State Government to exercise of powers and jurisdiction.	None
Nothing contained in section 5 shall be deemed to enable any member of the Delhi Special Police Establishment to exercise powers and jurisdiction in any area in a State, not being a Union territory or railway area, without the consent of the Government of that State.	None
Such a consent may not be necessary regarding the investigation by the special police force (DSPE) in respect of specified offences committed within Union Territory and other offences associated therewith.	None
That may be so, even if one of the accused involved in the given case may be residing or employed in some other State (outside the Union Territory) including in connection with the affairs of the State local body corporation, company or bank of the State or controlled by the State institution receiving or having received financial aid from State Government, as the case may be.	None
Taking any other view would require the special police force to comply with the formality of taking consent for investigation even in relation to specified offence committed within Union Territory, from the concerned State merely because of the fortuitous situation that part of the associated offence is committed in other State and the accused involved in the offence is residing in or employed in connection with the affairs of that State.	None
Such interpretation would result in an absurd situation especially when the 1946 Act extends to the whole of India and the special police force has been constituted with a special purpose for investigation of specified offences committed within the Union Territory, in terms of notification issued under Section 3 of the 1946 Act.	None
This Court in M. Balakrishna Reddy (supra) expounded the purport of Sections 3, 5 and 6 of the 1946 Act and observed in paragraph 19 as under  Plain reading of the above provisions goes to show that for exercise of jurisdiction by CBI in a State (other than Union Territory or Railway area), consent of the State Government is necessary.	None
In other words, before the provisions of the Delhi Act are invoked to exercise power and jurisdiction by Special Police Establishment in any State, the following conditions must be fulfilled A notification must be issued by the Central Government specifying the offences to be investigated by Delhi Special Police Establishment (Section 3)	None
An order must be passed by the Central Government extending the powers and jurisdiction of Delhi Special Police Establishment to any State in respect of the offences specified under Section 3 (Section 5) and Consent of the State Government must be obtained for the exercise of powers by Delhi Special Police Establishment in the State (Section 6).	None
This judgment dealt with a case where offence was committed in the State of Madhya Pradesh in the year 1996, which had already accorded consent under Section 6, but the accused at the time when the case was registered, was working in a different State i.e. the State of Uttar Pradesh.	None
The challenge in that case was to the order which according to the appellant therein, did not fulfil the elements of Section 6 of the 1946 Act.	None
That challenge came to be negatived by this Court in paragraphs 69 and 71 of the reported judgment, in the following words  In the present case, the decision produced by the respondent along with the counteraffidavit filed by the Superintendent of Police, CBI, Bhopal clearly sets out all the particulars required by Section 6 of the Delhi Act.	None
It refers to the file reference number, name of the department, the authority from whom it was issued and communicated to the department concerned of the Central Government.	None
It, therefore, cannot be said that the State Government had not granted consent under Section 6 of the Delhi Act.	None
xxx	None
xxx	None
xxx	None
A closer scrutiny of the relevant provisions of the Delhi Act also add credence to the view which we are inclined to take.	None
Section 3 refers to notification and requires the Central Government to issue notification specifying offences or class of offences to be investigated by Special Police Establishment.	None
Section 5 uses the term order and enables the Central Government to extend powers and jurisdiction of Special Police Establishment to other areas not covered by the Act.	None
Section 6 which speaks of consent of the State Government for the exercise of powers and jurisdiction of the Special Establishment neither refers to notification nor order.	None
It merely requires consent of the State Government for the application of the Delhi Act.	None
Parliament, in our considered opinion, advisedly and deliberately did not specify the mode, method or manner for granting consent though in two preceding sections such mode was provided.	None
If it intended that such consent should be in a particular form, it would certainly have provided the form as it was aware of different forms of exercise of power.	None
It, therefore, depends on the facts of each case whether the consent required by Section 6 of the Delhi Act has or has not been given by the State Government and no rule of universal application can be laid down.	None
The High Court, in the present case, after analysing the material on record clearly found that BRBCL was a Government undertaking and the project undertaken by it was funded by the Central Government and that it had its registered office in the Union Territory of Delhi (National Capital Territory of Delhi), where the offence of defrauding the undertaking (BRBCL) and siphoning of its funds was allegedly committed.	Reasoning
We see no reason to deviate from the opinion so recorded by the High Court.	None
The appellant, however, would rely on the allegations in the subject FIR to contend that the role of the appellant at best is in respect of certain official duty in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar.	Arguments of Petitioner
This submission overlooks the substratum of the allegations in the FIR, as registered by the CBI against the CEO of BRBCL	Reasoning
Shri C. Sivakumar and the appellant being co accused (party to the conspiracy) regarding defrauding the Government of India undertaking (BRBCL) having its registered office at Delhi (Union Territory) and siphoning of its funds.	Reasoning
The alleged role played by the appellant may be a means to facilitate the commission of crime of defrauding and siphoning of funds.	Reasoning
The FIR in that sense is not limited to an offence of manipulation of official records of the State of Bihar as such, but is about the means used by the different actors who were party to the conspiracy in defrauding the Government of India undertaking (BRBCL) and siphoning of its funds.	Reasoning
Indisputably, the registered office of BRBCL is within the jurisdiction of Union Territory of Delhi (National Capital Territory of Delhi) and allegedly the offence has been committed at Delhi, for which reason the Delhi Court will have jurisdiction to take cognizance thereof.	Reasoning
To put it differently, the offence in question has been committed outside the State of Bihar.	Reasoning
The investigation of the stated offence may incidentally transcend to the territory of State of Bihar because of the acts of commission and omission of the appellant who is resident of that State and employed in connection with the affairs of the State of Bihar.	Reasoning
That, however, cannot come in the way of special police force (DSPE) from investigating the offence committed at Delhi and has been so registered by it and is being investigated.	Reasoning
Had it been an offence limited to manipulation of official record of the State and involvement of officials of the State of Bihar, it would have been a different matter.	Reasoning
It is not the case of the appellant or the State of Bihar that even an offence accomplished at Delhi of defrauding of the Government of India undertaking (having registered office at Delhi) and siphoning of the funds thereof at Delhi can be investigated by the State of Bihar.	Reasoning
If the State police has had no jurisdiction to investigate the offence in question, as registered, then, seeking consent of the State in respect of such offence does not arise.	Reasoning
Any other approach would render the special provisions of the 1946 Act otiose.	Reasoning
In any case, the respondentState having granted general consent in terms of Section 6 of the 1946 Act vide notification dated 19.2.1996, it is not open to it to argue to the contrary.	Reasoning
The respondentState cannot be allowed to approbate and reprobate.	Reasoning
Indeed, the said notification contains a proviso, which predicates that if any public servant employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar is concerned in offences being investigated by the special police force pursuant to the notification, prior consent of the State Government qua him shall be obtained.	Reasoning
This proviso must operate limited to cases or offences which have been committed within the territory of the State of Bihar.	Reasoning
If the specified offence is committed outside the State of Bihar, as in this case in Delhi, the State police will have no jurisdiction to investigate such offence and for which reason seeking consent of the State to investigate the same would not arise.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the stated proviso will have no application to the offence in question and thus the Delhi special police force DSPE (CBI) must be held to be competent to register the FIR at Delhi and also to investigate the same without the consent of the State.	Reasoning
Even otherwise, the proviso has the effect of differentiating and classifying offenders differently for treatment thereunder, including investigation of offences and prosecution for offences on the basis of being public servant employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar.	Reasoning
The power bestowed on special police force in terms of Sections 2 and 3 of the 1946 Act cannot be undermined by an executive instruction in the form of proviso.	None
Dealing with a similar challenge to a statutory provision  Section 6A of the Act, the Constitution Bench of this Court in Subramanian Swamy (supra) held that subSection (1) thereof was invalid and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
In paragraphs 61 and 68 of the said decision, the Court noted thus The essence of police investigation is skillful inquiry and collection of material and evidence in a manner by which the potential culpable individuals are not forewarned.	None
The previous approval from the Government necessarily required under Section 6A would result in indirectly putting to notice the officers to be investigated before the commencement of investigation.	None
Moreover, if CBI is not even allowed to verify complaints by preliminary enquiry, how can the case move forward?	None
A preliminary enquiry is intended to ascertain whether a prima facie case for investigation is made out or not.	None
If CBI is prevented from holding a preliminary enquiry, at the very threshold, a fetter is put to enable CBI to gather relevant material.	None
As a matter of fact, CBI is not able to collect the material even to move the Government for the purpose of obtaining previous approval from the Central Government.	None
xxx	None
xxx	None
xxx	None
Can it be said that the classification is based on intelligible differentia when one set of bureaucrats of Joint Secretary level and above who are working with the Central Government are offered protection under Section 6A while the same level of officers who are working in the States do not get protection though both classes of these officers are accused of an offence under the PC Act, 1988 and inquiry investigation into such allegations is to be carried out.	None
Our answer is in the negative.	None
The provision in Section 6A, thus, impedes tracking down the corrupt senior bureaucrats as without previous approval of the Central Government, CBI cannot even hold preliminary inquiry much less an investigation into the allegations.	None
The protection in Section 6A has propensity of shielding the corrupt.	None
The object of Section 6A, that senior public servants of the level of Joint Secretary and above who take policy decision must not be put to any harassment, sidetracks the fundamental objective of the PC Act, 1988 to deal with corruption and act against senior public servants.	None
CBI is not able to proceed even to collect the material to unearth prima facie substance into the merits of allegations.	None
Thus, the object of Section 6A itself is discriminatory.	None
That being the position, the discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that there is a reasonable classification because it has rational relation to the object sought to be achieved.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
The thrust of this exposition is that every person committing the same offence is to be dealt with in the same manner in accordance with law, which is equal in its application to everyone.	None
The discrimination or differentiation must be founded on pertinent and real differences as distinguished from irrelevant and artificial ones.	Reasoning
In paragraph 70, the Court went on to observe that every public servant against whom there is a reasonable suspicion of commission of a crime or there are allegations of an offence under the PC Act has to be treated equally and similarly under law.	Reasoning
Suffice it to observe that the proviso contained in the stated notification dated 19.2.1996 cannot be the basis to disempower the special police force DSPE (CBI) from registering the offence committed at Delhi to defraud the Government of India undertaking (BRBCL) and siphoning of its funds and having its registered office at Delhi.	Reasoning
Allegedly, the stated offence has been committed at Delhi.	Reasoning
If so, the Delhi Courts will have jurisdiction to take cognizance thereof.	Reasoning
The State police (State of Bihar) cannot investigate the specified offences committed and accomplished at Delhi, being outside the territory of the State of Bihar.	Reasoning
It must follow that the consent of the State of Bihar to investigate such offence is not required in law and for which reason, the special police force would be competent to carry on the investigation thereof even if one of the accused allegedly involved in the commission of stated offence happens to be resident of the State of Bihar or employed in connection with the affairs of the Government of Bihar and allegedly committed associated offences in that capacity.	Reasoning
In other words, consent of the State under Section 6 cannot come in the way or constrict the jurisdiction of the special police force constituted under Section 2 to investigate specified offences under Section 3 of the 1946 Act committed within the Union Territories.	Reasoning
Indeed, when the Court of competent jurisdiction proceeds to take cognizance of offence and particularly against the appellant, it may consider the question of necessity of a prior sanction of the State of Bihar qua its official(s) as may be required by law.	Reasoning
That question can be considered on its own merits in accordance with law.	Reasoning
For the view that we have taken, it may not be necessary for us to analyse the decisions relied upon by the parties, which in our opinion, do not pertain to the question under consideration regarding the effect of the proviso contained in the notification dated 19.2.1996.	Reasoning
In view of the above, this appeal must fail and the same is accordingly dismissed.	Decision
Pending interlocutory applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.	Decision
