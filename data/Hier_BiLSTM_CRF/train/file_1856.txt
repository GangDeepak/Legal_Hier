 B. Sinha, J. Leave granted.	None
Interpretation of an exemption notification in regard to payment of sales tax is involved in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated 9.8.2006 passed by the High Court of Orissa in O.J.C. No. 2213 of 2001.	Issue

Facts
In other words, the benefit shall be applicable to incremental sales.	None
Respondent contended that in view of paragraph 7.5 of IPR, 1992 it was entitled to the benefit of deferment of payment of sales tax on finished products in respect of incremental sale over and above the immediate preceding year as it existed prior to expansion of the industrial unit upto a limit of Rs. 49.45 crores being 75 of the fixed capital investment in the plant and machinery.	Facts
It was furthermore claimed to be entitled to capital investment subsidy.	Facts
As the said benefits were denied to the respondent, it filed a writ petition before the High Court of Orissa, Cuttack which was marked as O.J.C. No. 2213 of 2001.	Facts
By reason of the impugned judgment, a Division Bench of the Orissa High Court allowed the said writ petition directing Opposite party No.2	None
The Director of Industries, Orissa is directed to reconsider the petitioners application for reevaluation of its investment for expansion of the unit and determine afresh, the extent to which the petitioner is entitled to the sales tax incentives and also to make necessary amendment to the eligibility certificate granted by it in accordance with the IPR, 1992.

Facts
Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the appellant, restricted his submissions only in regard to the exemption for payment of sales tax.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel submitted that although no period for obtaining the benefit thereof had been fixed in the original policy, the operational guidelines issued in that behalf will clearly point out that the said benefit was to be granted for a period of five years in case of new industries and for a period of seven years in case of pioneer industries.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this behalf, our attention has been drawn to paragraph 5 of operational guidelines in respect of grant of sales tax concession under IPR, 1992, which reads as under The Sales Tax exemption deferment certificate for raw material, spare parts and finished products shall be issued for a period of 5/7 year at a time.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Director of Industries Orissa and Director of H CI can however, inspect the unit and withdraw the certificate in case of nonfulfillment of the conditions.	Arguments of Petitioner
The beneficiary unit should also maintain necessary records and registers for this purpose as may be prescribed by the Director of Industries, Orissa.	None
It was pointed out that the purported operational guidelines had been circulated by reason of a circular letter dated 8.02.1993 by the Government of Orissa to all concerned which is in the following terms I am directed to enclose herewith a set of operational guidelines relating to Sales Tax concessions admissible under Industrial Policy Resolution 1992 (IPR 1992) effective from 1.8.92 for your information and necessary action.	None
You are requested kindly to bring it to the notice of all concerned for proper implementation of the provisions of IPR 1992	None
The learned Additional Solicitor General would submit that the respondent herein made expansion of its undertaking in the year 1997 and it having asked the benefit in terms of IPR, 1992 for a period of five years only as would be evident from its application filed in prescribed Form IIA dated 26.05.1999 which is in the following terms This certificate is issued for 5 (five) years of its commercial production or expansion modernization diversification and is valid from the date of 7.9.98 to 6.9.2003.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is estopped and precluded from contending otherwise, and, thus, it cannot be permitted to change its stand by seeking an amendment therefore as has been sought to be done by its letter dated 7.04.2000 and, thus, it was rightly rejected by the Government of Orissa in terms of its letter dated 17.05.2000.	None
The said letter dated 17.05.2000 reads as under Paragraph 7.4 and 7.5 (Part II) of IPR92 are corelated.	Arguments of Petitioner
Though paragraph 7.5 is silent about the period of sales tax benefit, it refers to the previous paragraph of 7.4.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, while considering to extend the S.T. benefit, one has to go by the provisions of paragraph 6.1 (partII) of the IPR92 which states as follows Subject to operational guidelines instructions and procedure, sales tax incentives shall be allowed after the unit has gone into commercial production and from the date of commercial production.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the operational guidelines, issued to Industries Deptt.	Arguments of Petitioner
vide Letter No.4068 dtd.	Arguments of Petitioner
8.2.93 under the IPR92	Arguments of Petitioner
the period of exemption deferment for E M D has been clearly mentioned as 5 years.	Arguments of Petitioner
Accordingly the Director of Industries, Orissa has issued eligibility certificate for a period of 5 years w.e.f.	Arguments of Petitioner
7.9.98 to 6.9.2003.	Arguments of Petitioner
I trust that the above clarification will remove your doubt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. A.K. Ganguli, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the exemption benefit was limited to the finished products and not to the rawmaterials and, thus, there is no infirmity in the impugned judgment.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court passed the impugned judgment inter alia on the premise that operational guidelines being in the nature of a subordinate subdelegated legislation, the same was required to be in consonance with the IPR and by reason thereof no other or further condition could have been stipulated so as to prevail over the policy decision itself holding If we accept the contention advanced by the learned Counsel for the Revenue that the operational guidelines provide a limitation or time period for sales tax incentives, it would tantamount to accepting a principle that by subdelegated legislation, a delegatee may also effectively amend or supplant legislation, which it is clearly incompetent to do.	None
On a reading of the said operational guidelines and the terms thereof would clearly indicate that the stipulations regarding time period find mention in Clause5 of the operational guidelines.	None
It would be clear that the said stipulation would relate only to those industries covered under Para 7.3 and 7.4 of the IPR 1992 and would be limited to apply to those industries only to which time periods have been stipulated in the IPR itself and not to the industries activities covered under Paragraphs 7.2 and 7.5.	None
Since the petitioners industry is covered in the EMD category under Para7.5 of the IPR 1992 read with Entry No.44 of SRO No.1091 of 1992, Clause 5 of the operational guidelines cannot be said to apply to it.	None
We are of the view that Clause5 of the operational guidelines and stipulation in the Eligibility Form (the eligibility certificate), to the extent that it provides for a period of time is not in consonance with the IPR, 1992, is clearly without jurisdiction without sanction of law and is also ultra vires to the IPR 1992.	None
The operational guideline and or instructions were made for administration of incentive contained in the Policy and not for the purpose of imposing any new stipulation and or conditions alien to and or not in consonance with the passing of the 1992 Policy.	None
Such a stipulation cannot be in law be read into and allowed to operate since it would frustrate the very objective sought to be achieved by the 1992 Policy Declaration.	None
It was furthermore held Drawing an analogy from the aforesaid principles of law, we are of the view that for the incentive under paragraph 7.5 read with entry No.44 as notified in S.R.O No. 1019 of 1992, exemption of tax did not provide any period of limitation.	None
Neither the IPR, 1992 nor the Finance Department Notification in SRO No.1019 of 1992 provided any stipulation as to how long the exemption from sales tax would remain in force and therefore, the position that emerges therefrom, is that, such exemption granted under the Notification was to remain operative till the industry utilizes exhausts the incentive granted to it.	None
The petitioner is entitled to such benefit till such time such exemption is allowed to remain in force without being withdrawn by the subsequent notification.	None
It is important to point out here that no such notification withdrawing such exemption has been brought to our notice in course of hearing.	None
Indisputably, pursuant to or in furtherance of the aforementioned IPR, 1992, the State Government amended the provisions of the Orissa Sales Tax Act.	Reasoning
Section 6 of the said Act reads as under Tax Free Goods The State Government may, by notification, subject to such conditions and exceptions, if any, exempt from tax the sale or purchase of any goods, or class of goods and likewise withdraw any such exemption.	None
Indisputably, again pursuant to or in furtherance of the aforementioned provision, the Finance Department of the State of Orissa had issued notification bearing SRO No. 1091 of 1992 dated 23.09.1992 and inserted Entry 44 in terms whereof the respondent became entitled to exemption.	Reasoning
Entry 44 of the said notification reads as under Sale of finished products of an existing industrial unit, located in Orissa i.e. an industrial unit which has gone into production before 1st August, 1992, and which has undertaken expansion modernization diversification of the said unit after the 1st day of August, 1992 on the basis of separate project report duly appraised by the financial institution, and a certificate to this effect that is, regarding expansion modernization diversification of the unit is produced from the concerned General Manager, Project Manager, District Industries Centre in case of Small Scale Units and a certificate in Form E (92) is produced from the Director of Industries, Orissa in case of Medium, Large and pioneer Units.	None
The exemption of sales tax shall be limited to 60 per cent of the additional capital investment, in plant and machinery only in ZoneC, 75 per cent of the additional capital investment in plant and machinery only in ZoneB and 100 per cent of additional capital investment in plant and machinery only in ZoneA. Explanation I Additional capital investment in plant and machinery means additional investment of 50 per cent of more of the undepreciated book value of fixed capital investment of an existing unit in acquisition of plant and machinery for expanding modernization diversifying the production of the said unit.	None
Provided that the benefit of exemption is admissible only on the incremental sales arising out of such expansion modernization and diversification.	None
Provided further that no exemption as indicated above shall be allowed to the following categories of industries, namely Rice Hullers and Rice Mills.	None
Flour Mills including manufacture of Besan, Pulse Mill and chuda mills.	Reasoning
347 Further, the eligibility certificate granted for sales tax concession on sale of finished products categorically states that exemption may be available as per Finance Department Notification No. SRO 1091 of 1992 as amended from time to time up to a ceiling amount of 1. 100 of the additional capital investment in plant and machineries being located in ZoneA 2. 75 do ZoneB 3. 60	Reasoning
do ZoneC	None
It is not in dispute that in the said entry, during which the same would remain operative, no period far less the period of five or seven years had been mentioned.	Reasoning
The only limitation prescribed thereby was that only 75 of the additional capital investment in Zone B would be allowed where the unit of the respondent is situate.	Reasoning
In terms of Clause 5 of IPR, 1992, the respondent became entitled to exemption from payment of sales tax on finished products for an amount of Rs. 49.45 crores being 75 of Rs. 63.95 crores invested in plant and machinery.	Reasoning
We may notice that the Finance Department of the State of Orissa passed a consequential order in IPR, 1992 bearing SRO No. 1091 of 1992 dated 23.09.1992 which was given effect from 1.08.1992.	Reasoning
A bare perusal of the said notification would clearly show that whenever the period upto which the exemption, could be obtained was required to be stated had specifically been done therein, as for example Sl.	Reasoning
Nos. 30A, 41, 42A and 43A etc.	Reasoning
We may, furthermore, notice that against the Entry 44, however, what is mentioned is the extent to which such exemption would be granted.	Reasoning
No period during which such exemption is to be obtained was stated.	Reasoning
In other words, no period of limitation was fixed thereby.	Reasoning
In view of the clear legal provision as also the aforementioned notification dated 23.09.1992, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the exemption in respect of deferment of sales tax having been provided for under the Orissa Sales Tax Act as also the notification issued thereunder, the High Court, in our opinion, is correct in taking its view.	Reasoning
It is furthermore a well settled principle of law that an exemption notification must be liberally construed.	Reasoning
See Commissioner of Customs (Imports), Mumbai v. Tullow India Operations Ltd., (2005) 13 SCC 789, Tata Iron Steel Co. Ltd. v. State of Jharkhand and Others, (2005) 4 SCC 272, Government of India and Ors.	Reasoning
