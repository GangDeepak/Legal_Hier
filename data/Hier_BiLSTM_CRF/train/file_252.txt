Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel submitted that when the trial judge has so satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for framing the charges against the accused, in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, the High Court ought not to have interfered and quashed the charges framed by the trial court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Harsh Parashar, learned counsel appearing for the State of Madhya Pradesh reiterated the contentions and submitted that the averments in the charge sheet and the circumstances indicated thereon are sufficient to prima facie link respondent Nos.1 and 2 to the occurrence and while so, the High Court erred in setting aside the order of the Second Additional Sessions Judge and quashing the charges.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Santosh Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2 submitted that even if the averments in the charge sheet are accepted, no prima facie case is made out against the accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2 and there was nonapplication of judicial mind by the learned trial judge and considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court rightly quashed the charges framed against the accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2 and the impugned order therefore, does not suffer from any infirmity.	Arguments of Respondent
We have carefully considered the submissions and perused the impugned order and materials on record.	None
As per the allegations in the charge sheet, on the date of occurrence i.e. 24.12.2015, the accusedrespondents Ghanshyam and Bhagwan went with deceased Gopal Saran to the farm of Ghanshyam for ploughing the land with tractor and that all the three consumed liquor together at the place of incident.	None
Thus, as per the allegations in the charge sheet, the deceased was last seen alive in the company of accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2.	None
As per the statement of Usha, wife of Ghanshyam and Nisha, daughter of Ghanshyam, the accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2 had returned home at 09.00 pm in the night of 24.12.2015.	None
Though, the body of deceased was found in the field of respondentaccused Ghanshyam, he did not inform the family of deceased Gopal Saran nor informed the police about the same.	None
In the complaint filed by the appellant before the Magistrate, the appellant has alleged that ?when she went running near to her husband?s dead body, Ganesh son of Ghanshyam caught hold of her and forcibly locked her in a room in his house and did not allow her to go near the dead body of her husband? .	None
The allegations in the charge sheet also suggest that the accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2 had earlier quarrelled with deceased Gopal Saran and thereby suggesting a motive for the crime.	None
Though the circumstances alleged in the charge sheet are to be established during the trial by adducing the evidence, the allegations in the charge sheet show a prima facie case against the accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2.	Reasoning
The circumstances alleged by the prosecution indicate that there are sufficient grounds for proceedings against the accused.	Reasoning
At the time of framing the charges, only prima facie case is to be seen whether case is beyond reasonable doubt, is not to be seen at this stage.	None
At the stage of framing the charge, the court has to see if there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.	None
While evaluating the materials, strict standard of proof is not required only prima facie case against the accused is to be seen.	None
Chapter XVIII Crl.	None
P.C. deals with ?	None
Trial before a Court of Session?.	None
As per Section 226 Crl.P.C., the public prosecutor is required to open the case before the Sessions Court by describing the charge brought against the accused and stating by what evidence, he proposes to prove the guilt of the accused.	None
Section 227 Crl.	None
P.C. deals with discharge and it reads as under ?227.	None
Discharge.	None
If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in this behalf, the Judge considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing.?	None
Considering the scope of Sections 227 and 228 Crl.P.C., in Amit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and another (2012) 9 SCC 460 , the Supreme Court held as under Framing of a charge is an exercise of jurisdiction by the trial court in terms of Section 228 of the Code, unless the accused is discharged under Section 227 of the Code.	None
Under both these provisions, the court is required to consider the ?record of the case?	None
and documents submitted therewith and, after hearing the parties, may either discharge the accused or where it appears to the court and in its opinion there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence, it shall frame the charge.	None
Once the facts and ingredients of the section exists, then the court would be right in presuming that there is ground to proceed against the accused and frame the charge accordingly.	None
This presumption is not a presumption of law as such.	None
The satisfaction of the court in relation to the existence of constituents of an offence and the facts leading to that offence is a sine qua non for exercise of such jurisdiction.	None
It may even be weaker than a prima facie case.	None
There is a fine distinction between the language of Sections 227 and 228 of the Code.	None
Section 227 is the expression of a definite opinion and judgment of the Court while Section 228 is tentative.	None
Thus, to say that at the stage of framing of charge, the Court should form an opinion that the accused is certainly guilty of committing an offence, is an approach which is impermissible in terms of Section 228 of the Code.	None
19.	None
At the initial stage of framing of a charge, the court is concerned not with proof but with a strong suspicion that the accused has committed an offence, which, if put to trial, could prove him guilty.	None
All that the court has to see is that the material on record and the facts would be compatible with the innocence of the accused or not.	None
The final test of guilt is not to be applied at that stage.	None
We may refer to the wellsettled law laid down by this Court in State of Bihar v. Ramesh Singh (1977) 4 SCC 39 (SCC pp.	None
4142, para 4)?4.	None
Under Section 226 of the Code while opening the case for the prosecution the Prosecutor has got to describe the charge against the accused and state by what evidence he proposes to prove the guilt of the accused.	None
Thereafter comes at the initial stage the duty of the court to consider the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith and to hear the submissions of the accused and the prosecution in that behalf.	None
The Judge has to pass thereafter an order either under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code.	None
If the Judge considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing?, as enjoined by Section 227.	None
If, on the other hand, the Judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which (b) is exclusively triable by the court, he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused?, as provided in Section 228.	None
Reading the two provisions together in juxtaposition, as they have got to be, it would be clear that at the beginning and the initial stage of the trial the truth, veracity and effect of the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce are not to be meticulously judged.	None
Nor is any weight to be attached to the probable defence of the accused.	None
It is not obligatory for the Judge at that stage of the trial to consider in any detail and weigh in a sensitive balance whether the facts, if proved, would be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or not.	None
The standard of test and judgment which is to be finally applied before recording a finding regarding the guilt or otherwise of the accused is not exactly to be applied at the stage of deciding the matter under Section 227 or Section 228 of the Code.	None
At that stage the court is not to see whether there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction.	None
Strong suspicion against the accused, if the matter remains in the region of suspicion, cannot take the place of proof of his guilt at the conclusion of the trial.	None
But at the initial stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the court to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence then it is not open to the court to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.	None
The presumption of the guilt of the accused which is to be drawn at the initial stage is not in the sense of the law governing the trial of criminal cases in France where the accused is presumed to be guilty unless the contrary is proved.	None
But it is only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the court should proceed with the trial or not.	None
If the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in crossexamination or rebutted by the defence evidence, if any, cannot show that the accused committed the offence, then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial.	None
An exhaustive list of the circumstances to indicate as to what will lead to one conclusion or the other is neither possible nor advisable.	None
We may just illustrate the difference of the law by one more example.	None
If the scales of pan as to the guilt or innocence of the accused are something like even at the conclusion of the trial, then, on the theory of benefit of doubt the case is to end in his acquittal.	None
But if, on the other hand, it is so at the initial stage of making an order under Section 227 or Section 228, then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under Section 228 and not under Section 227.??	None
After referring to Amit Kapoor, in Dinesh Tiwari v. State of Uttar Pradesh and another (2014) 13 SCC 137 , the Supreme Court held that for framing charge under Section 228 Crl.P.C., the judge is not required to record detailed reasons as to why such charge is framed.	None
On perusal of record and hearing of parties, if the judge is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for presuming that the accused has committed the offence triable by the Court of Session, he shall frame the charge against the accused for such offence.	None
As discussed above, in the present case, upon hearing the parties and considering the allegations in the charge sheet, the learned Second Additional Sessions Judge was of the opinion that there were sufficient grounds for presuming that the accused has committed the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 IPC.	Reasoning
The order dated 12.12.2018 framing the charges is not a detailed order.	Reasoning
For framing the charges under Section 228 Crl.P.C., the judge is not required to record detailed reasons.	Reasoning
As pointed out earlier, at the stage of framing the charge, the court is not required to hold an elaborate enquiry only prima facie case is to be seen.	Reasoning
As held in Knati Bhadra Shah and another v. State of West Bengal (2000) 1 SCC 722 , while exercising power under Section 228 Crl.	Reasoning
P.C.,	Reasoning
the judge is not required record his reasons for framing the charges against the accused.	Reasoning
Upon hearing the parties and based upon the allegations and taking note of the allegations in the charge sheet, the learned Second Additional Sessions Judge was satisfied that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused and framed the charges against the accused respondent Nos.1 and 2.	Reasoning
While so, the High Court was not right in interfering with the order of the trial court framing the charges against the accusedrespondent Nos.1 and 2 under Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 IPC and the High Court, in our view, erred in quashing the charges framed against the accused.	Reasoning
The impugned order cannot therefore be sustained and is liable to be set aside.	Reasoning
In the result, the impugned judgment dated 25.02.2019 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore Bench in Criminal Revision No.402 of 2019 is set aside and this appeal is allowed.	Decision
Sessions Trial Case No.ST/150/2018 is restored and Second Additional Sessions Judge, Mandleswar, West Nimad, Madhya Pradesh shall proceed with the matter in accordance with law.	Decision
We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter.	Decision
