The High Court held that the words entirely exclusively or only were not used in the notification.	Facts
The notification exempted steel ingots in which duty paid pig iron was used.	Facts
The High Court also held that the notification would have to be interpreted in a manner that the statute would not cast a burden twice over for payment of tax on the tax payer unless the language of the statute is so compellingly certain to that effect.16.	Facts
The appellant contended that exemption is given for virgin pig iron and if pig iron was used and thereafter reduced to scrap there could be no exemption in respect of scrap.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also said on behalf of the appellant that scrap iron was different from pig iron, and, therefore, the refund of the duty paid on pig iron would not arise.17.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant Government relied on Notification No. 75/62 dated April 25, 1962 which gave exemption to steel ingots from so much of the duty of excise leviable thereon if produced out of scrap obtained from duty paid pig iron or if produced out of old iron or steel scrap or scrap obtained from duty paid steel ingots or products.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant Government relied on Notification No. 75/62 dated April 25, 1962 for two reasons.	Arguments of Petitioner
First, it was said that the exemption in Notification No. 30/60 dated March 1, 1960 exempting steel ingots in which duty paid pig iron is used will not exempt scrap iron which is different from pig iron.	Arguments of Petitioner
Second, Notification No. 75/62 dated April 25, 1962 gave exemption to scrap iron in certain cases and when Notification No. 75/62 was rescinded in 1964 no exemption could thereafter be claimed in respect of scrap.18.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondent contended that the appellant all throughout before the Revenue Authorities and the High Court knew and treated the case of the respondent to be a claim for exemption of duty paid pig iron in the manufacture of steel ingots.	Arguments of Respondent
In paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the statement of case of the appellant it is said that the respondent claimed refund of the duty paid on pig iron used in ingot moulds and bottom stools being the melted scrap in the manufacture of steel ingots.	None
In the revision order of the Revenue dated July 7, 1967 in paragraphs 4 and 6 it is stated that the claim of the respondent was for duty paid material used in the making of steel ingots.	None
The Revenue Authorities in the said order did not accept the claim of the respondent for exemption on the ground that duty paid pig iron was mixed with non duty paid pig iron.19.	None
In paragraph 9 of the affidavit of the Revenue used in the High Court the Revenue said that the various scraps mixed included duty paid and non duty paid scraps.	None
The Revenue referred to rejected ingot moulds and bottom stools as scrap.20.	None
The respondent in the affidavit in reply in the High Court stated that the question for consideration in these writ applications is the rate of duty leviable on steel ingots produced from processed moulds and bottom plates which have already borne a duty.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondent also stated that the processed mould and bottom plates used in the manufacture of steel ingots are recorded.21.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondent contended that it was never the case of the Revenue that it was scrap in respect of which the respondent wanted exemption.	Arguments of Respondent
for the respondent rightly submitted that if the Revenue made that case the respondent would have produced not only affidavit evidence but also evidence of experts to determine the question of fact whether the article, viz., melted ingot moulds and bottom stools altered the character of duty paid pig iron.22.	Arguments of Respondent
Counsel for the respondent is right in the contention that the only question here is whether duty paid pig iron is used along with non duty paid materials.	Issue
There is no dispute that there are materials and data to find out the quantity of duty paid pig iron used.	Issue
Pig iron is made out of iron ore plus limestone plus coke.	Reasoning
Pig iron is melted and processed into ingot moulds and bottom stools.	Reasoning
Nothing is added to pig iron.	Reasoning
When ingot moulds and bottom stools become unserviceable they are broken.	Reasoning
This becomes scrap and is melted and used in the manufacture of steel ingots.	Reasoning
The respondent rightly contends that all the time it is duty paid pig iron which is processed into ingot moulds and bottom stools and again broken into scrap and melted in the making of steel ingots.23.	Reasoning
The High Court rightly held that the contention of the Revenue fails on two broad grounds.	Reasoning
First, there cannot be double taxation on the same article.	Reasoning
Counsel for the Revenue gave the example of excise duty on motor cars, in spite of the fact that there was duty on tyres and duty on metal sheets.	Reasoning
The analogy is misplaced.	Reasoning
In such cases the duty is on the end product of motor car as a whole.	Reasoning
The duty on tyres and the duty on metal sheets do not enter the area of duty on motor car.	Reasoning
Second, Notification No. 30/60 grants exemption to duty paid pig iron.	Reasoning
The High Court rightly said that the Notification does not say that exemption is granted only when duty paid pig iron is used and that the exemption would not be available if duty paid pig iron is mixed with other non duty paid materials.	Reasoning
If the intention of the Government were to exclude the exemption to duty paid pig iron when mixed with other materials then the notification would have used the expression only or exclusively or entirely in regard to duty paid pig iron.	Reasoning
The object of the notification was to grant relief by exempting duty paid pig iron.24.	Reasoning
For these reasons, the judgment of the High Court is affirmed and the appeals are dismissed.	Decision
Parties will pay and bear their own costs.	Decision
