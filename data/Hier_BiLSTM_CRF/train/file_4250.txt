The respondent firm constructed the six sheds for the purpose of its business after taking the site threof on a long lease.	Facts
On May 19, 1944 the Collector of Poona requisitioned the premises of the respondent under the Defence of India Act as from May 19, 1944 for the purpose of using them as store houses for food grains.	Facts
Initially the requisition order covered the six sheds as well as the office of the respondent, but at the request of the respondent firm the Collector agreed to allow it to remain in possession of the office premises.	Facts
In October, 1944 the respondent made a claim for Rs. 1,85,200 on account of compensation for the requisitioned premises.	Facts
In June, 1946 the Collector offered to pay compensation at the rate of Rs. 310 per month.	Facts
The respondent feeling dissatisfied with the offer of the Collector, moved the Government for a reference to arbitration under the provisions of the Defence of India Act.	Facts
The Civil Judge, Senior Division, Poona was thereafter appointed arbitrator on November 10, 1947.	Facts
The Government appointed its Consulting Supervisor as an assessr to help the arbitrator in determining the amount or compensation.	Facts
As against that the respondent appointed an architect as its assessor.	Facts
There was considerable difference in the estimates of the two assessors regarding the amount of compensation payable to the respondent.	Facts
The Civil Judge, who had been appointed arbitrator, gave his award on April 15, 1948.	Facts

The above amount included Rs. 1,25,500 on account of lump sum for loss of earning and Rs. 2,000 on account of costs of arbitration.	Facts
3.	None
In computing the respondents total income the Income Tax Officer brought to tax the two sums of Rs. 22,180/ on account of rent receipts and Rs. 20,551 on account of interest.	Facts
Besides that, the Income Tax Officer brought to tax the sum of Rs. 1,05,074/ under Section 10 of the Act by attributing it to the respondents business in timber.	Facts
This figure of Rs. 1,05,074/ was arrived at by deducting out of Rs.	Facts
1,25,500 a sum of Rs. 20,426/ which, according to the Income Tax Officer, had been spent by the respondent in the claim proceedings against the Government over and above the amount of Rs. 2,000/ which had been awarded as costs by the arbitrator.	Facts
The respondent feeling aggrieved by the finding of the Income Tax Officer that the sum of Rs. 1,05,074 was business and taxable receipt filed appeal against the order of the IncomeTax Officer.	Facts
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner accepted the respondents appeal and held that the above amount was capital receipt.	Facts
On further appeal by the department, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal held that the sum of Rs. 1,25,500 was a revenue receipt as it had been received on account of the loss of earnings of the timber business.	Facts
The respondent was, however, allowed to set off the losses of Rs. 4,572 and Rs. 498, which had been brought forward from the assessment years 194950 and 195051, against the sum of Rs. 1,05,074.	Facts
On being moved by the respondent, the Tribunal referred the following question to the High Court Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the sum of Rs. 1,05,074/ received by the applicant as compensation from the Government is taxable as income of the applicant or is a capital receipt in its hands?	Facts
The High Court held that the amount received by the respondent for the requisitioning of the six sheds or godowns was in the nature of capital receipt in the hands of the respondent firm for the damage sustained in the profit making apparatus.	Facts
It was, in the opinion of the High Court, not a revenue receipt and as such, not taxable.	Facts
4.	None
In appeal Mr. Ahuja on behalf of the appellant has assailed the judgment of the High Court and has urged that the sum of Rupees 1,05,074 received by the respondent was a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt as the amount represented the compensation payable for loss of earnings consequent upon the requisition of the sheds of the respondent.	Arguments of Petitioner
As against that Mr. Hajarnavis on behalf of the respondent has urged that the amount in question was a capital receipt and the decision of the High Court in this respect was correct.	Arguments of Respondent
In our opinion, the contention advanced on behalf of the appellant is well founded and that sum in question represents a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt.	None
5.	None
In order to resolve the controversy as to whether the sum of Rs. 1,05,074 received by the respondent was a revenue receipt or a capital receipt we must try to ascertain the true nature and character of the payment.	None
Although the distinction between capital receipt and revenue receipt is well recognized, the task of assigning it to the appropriate head in border line cases is not free from difficulty and becomes one of much refinement.	None
Decided cases can provide illustrations and afford indications of the kind of considerations which may relevantly be borne in mind in approaching the problem.	None
In the final analysis, however, the controversy would have to be resolved in the light of the facts and circumstances of each individual case.	None
It would, therefore, be relevant to look into the circumstances under which the payment was made.	None
In this respect we find that after the sheds of the respondent had been requisitioned, the respondent commenced proceedings for claiming compensation.	None
The Civil Judge Poona was appointed arbitrator to determine the amount of compensation.	None
In the course of proceedings before the arbitrator, the respondent filed written statement claiming compensation inter alia, for loss of profits.	None
The arbitrator by his award dated April 15, 1948 awarded a sum of Rs. 1,25,500 for loss of earnings to the respondent.	None
In addition to that we have the finding of the Tribunal that the respondent firm during the period for which the claim for compensation was made had been carrying on business in its usual name and style in the same office premises in which it used to carry on business prior to the requisition of the godowns by the Government.	None
The effect of the requisition of the godowns, according to the Tribunal, was not to stop the business of the respondent.	None
On the contrary, the respondent continued to carry on the business though at a reduced scale.	None
The finding of the Tribunal in this respect was as under.	None
As already pointed out, the office premises remained with the assessee firm and the business of disposing of the stockintrade continued to be directed from that place.	None
Thus this was not a case of a business coming to a standstill altogether	None
but it is a case of carrying on the same business on a smaller scale.	None
Even this business was carried on by the assessee firm in its usual name and style from the same office premises from which it used to carry it on prior to the requisition of the godowns by the Government If any injury was caused to the assessees business, including the capital assets it held for the purpose of carrying on that business, it was to the volumes of the business and not to the profitmaking apparatus itself.	None
In the light of the above findings of fact, we have no doubt that the amount received by the respondent for the loss of earnings was revenue receipt.	None
It can hardly be disputed that if the respondent firm had been earnings profits as a result of its business during the years the premises in question remained under requisition, the said profit would have been treated as revenue receipt and liable to be taxed as such.	None
The amount received in lieu of the profits which would have been earned if the premises had not been requisitioned, in our opinion, would partake of the same character as the profits.	None
The present is not a case wherein the respondent firm was permanently deprived of a source of income.	None
On the contrary, the present is a case arising out of requisition of the premises.	None
Requisition, unlike acquisition, is of a temporary nature and though it may extend over some years, it has not the element of permanent.	None
The compensation paid to the respondent represents the supposed profits which the respondent would have earned during the years the premises remained under requisition but which profits the respondent could not earn because of the requisition.	None
6.	None
A case somewhat similar to the present case is Commr. of Income Tax Excess.	None
Profits Tax, Bombay City v. Shamsher Printing Press, 39 ITR 90 (AIR 1961 SC 98 ).	None
The respondent firm in that case had for the purpose of its business a printing press.	None
The premises in which the press was housed were requisitioned by the Government and the respondent had to shift its business to another place.	None
Of the various sums paid as compensation for the requisition, the Government paid Rupees 57,435 towards the claim of the respondent on account of the compulsory vocation of the premises, disturbance and loss of business.	None
It was held by this Court that the sum of Rs. 57,434 had not been received by the respondent for any injury to its capital assets, including goodwill.	None
The above sum, it was further held, had been received as compensation for loss of profit and was a revenue receipt liable to tax.	None
7. Reference has been made by Mr. Hajarnavis to the observations in the award of the arbitrator regarding the manner of computing the compensation payable to the respondent for the loss of earning.	None
The arbitrator in this connection took the view that the amount of two years purchase made by the respondent would be the most equitable and fair figure for determining the amount of compensation.	None
The lump sum payable to the respondent for loss of earning was thus found to be Rupees 1,25,500.	None
The important thing to note is that the above sum was paid to the respondent on account of loss of earning.	None
The method of computing the compensation payable for the loss of earning would not in our opinion, alter the real character or the essential nature of the receipt of the said compensation in the hand of the respondent.	None
As observed by Lord Buckmaster in the case of Glenboig Union Fireclay Co. Ltd. v. Commrs. of Inland Revenue, (1922) 12 Tax Cas 427 there is no relation between the measure that is used for the purpose of calculating a particular result and the quality of the figure that is arrived at by means of the application of that test.	None
The above observation was quoted with approval by this Court in the case of Senairam Doongarmall v. Commr.	None
of Income Tax 42 ITR 392	None
at p. 397 (AIR 1961 SC 1579 )	None
and it was held that it is the quality of payment that is decisive of the character of the payment and not the method of the payment or its measure as makes it fall within capital or revenue.	None
8.	None
Reliance has been placed by Mr. Hajarnavis on the ratio of the decision of this Court in the case of Senairam Doongarmall, 42 ITR 392 (AIR 1961 SC 1579 ) (supra).	None
The assessee family in that case owned a tea estate consisting of tea gardens, factories and other buildings and carried on the business of growing and manufacturing tea.	None
The factory and other buildings on the estate were requisitioned for defence purposes by military authorities.	None
Though the assessee continued in possession of the tea gardens and tended them to preserve the plants, the manufacturer of tea was stopped completely.	None
The assessee was paid compensation for the years 1944 and 1945 under the Defence of India Rules, calculated on the basis of the outturn of tea that would have been manufactured by the assessee during that period.	None
This Court held that the amount of compensation received by the assessee was not revenue receipt and did not comprise any element of income.	None
In arriving at that conclusion, the Court took note of the fact that tax was payable by an assessee under the head.	None
Profits and gains of a business in respect of a business carried on by him.	None
As the assessee had not carried on any business at all the compensation received by the assessee was held to be not profit of business.	None
This case, in our opinion cannot be of much help to the respondent because in the present case, as observed earlier, the Tribunal has expressly found that the respondent was carrying on the business during the relevant years.	None
9.	None
Reliance has also been placed by Mr. Hajarnavis upon the decision of House of Lords in the case of the Glenboig Union Fireclay Co. Ltd. , (1922) 12 Tax Cas 427 (supra).	None
The assessee in that case was carrying on business for the manufacturing of fireclay goods and had taken in connection with that business a fireclay field on lease, over part of which ran the lines of the Caledonian Railway.	None
The Railway administration prohibited the assessee from excavating the field within a certain distance of the rails and paid compensation therefor in accordance with the provisions of a statute.	None
It was held by the House of Lords that this was a capital receipt as the compensation was really the price paid for sterlizing the assets from which otherwise profits might have been obtained.	None
It would follow from the above that the fireclay field was accepted to be a capital asset which was to be utilized for the carrying on of the business of manufacturing fireclay goods.	None
When the assessee was prohibited from exploiting the field, it was considered to be an injury inflicted on his capital asset.	None
The case of Glenboig Union Fireclay Co. Ltd., (1922) 12 Tax Cas 427 (supra) was cited before this Court in Commr. of Income Tax, Nagpur v. Rai Bahadur Jairam Valji, 35 ITR 148 (AIR 1959 SC 291 ) and in Senairam Doongarmall, 42 ITR 392 (AIR 1961 SC 1579 ) (supra) and was distinguished on the ground that it related to the sterlization and distruction of a capital asset.	None
In the present case there has been no sterilization and destruction of the capital asset of the respondent firm.	None
As such, the case of The Glenboig Union Fireclay Co. Ltd. cannot afford much assistance in the present case.	None
10.	None
Reference has also been made by Mr. Hajarnavis to the cases of S. R. Y. Sivaram Prasad Bahadur v. Commr.	Reasoning
of Income Tax, Andhra Pradesh, 82 ITR 527 (AIR 1972 SC 260 ) and Commr. of Income Tax, Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh v. Prabhu Dayal, 82 ITR 804 (AIR 1972 SC 386 ).	Reasoning
Sivaram Prasad Bahadurs case related to interim payments made under the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948 of a former holder of an estate which had been abolished during the period between the taking over of the estate and the final determination and deposit of compensation under that Act.	Reasoning
It was held to be a capital receipt and not liable to tax.	Reasoning
Prabhu Dayals case related to an assessee who had discovered by chance the existence of Kankar in the Jind State.	Reasoning
The assessee brought about an agreement between the State and one Shanti Prasad Jain for the acquisition of sole and exclusive monopoly rights for manufacturing cement.	Reasoning
Shanti Prasad Jain transferred his rights under the agreement to a company of which the assessee was one of the promoters.	Reasoning
For the services rendered by him, the company agreed to pay the assessee a commission of 1 per cent.	Reasoning
on the yearly net profits earned by the company.	Reasoning
The agreement was acted upon till 1950 whereafter the company did not pay the commission to the assessee.	Reasoning
The assessee filed a suit which ended in a compromise.	Reasoning
In terms of the compromise, the assessee was paid certain amounts as commission for the years 1951, 1952 and 1953 further sum of Rupees 70,000 by way of compensation for the determination of the agreement between him and the company as from January 1, 1954.	Reasoning
Question which arose for determination was whether the sum of Rupees 70,000 was capital receipt in the hand of the assessee.	Reasoning
The assessee, it was found, had not engaged either in the business of discovering kankar or any minerals or in the business of bringing about agreement between the parties.	Reasoning
There was indeed, no evidence that he was a business man.	Reasoning
It was held that none of the activities of the assessee could be considered to be business activity.	Reasoning
The compromise, in the opinion of this Court, destroyed an income yielding asset of the assessee and in its place he was given Rupees 70,000 as compensation.	Reasoning
The sum of Rupees 70,000 was accordingly held to be capital receipt.	Reasoning
It is manifest from the narration of the facts of Sivaram Prasad Bahadur and Prabhu Dayals case that there is no similarity between those cases and the present case.	Reasoning
As such, these two decisions cannot be of any avail to the respondent.	None
11.It may also be mentioned that Mr. Hajarnavis has assailed the findings of fact of the Tribunal.	None
In this respect we are of the view that the Tribunal is the final fact finding authority.	Reasoning
It is for the Tribunal to find facts and it is for the High Court and this Court to lay down the law applicable to the facts found.	Reasoning
Neither the High Court nor this Court has jurisdiction to go behind or to question the statement of facts made by the Tribunal.	Reasoning
The statement of case is binding on the parties and they are not entitled to go behind the facts of the Tribunal in the statement.	Reasoning
When the question referred to the Hitgh Court speaks of on the facts and circumstances of the case, it means on the facts and circumstances found by the Tribunal and not on the facts and circumstances as may be found by the High Court (see Karnani Properties Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal, 82 ITR 547 (AIR 1972 SC 2315 ).	Reasoning
12.	None
As a result of the above, we accept the appeal set aside the judgment of the High Court and answer the question referred by the Tribunal in favour of the department.	Decision
In our opinion, the sum of Rupees 1,05,074 received by the respondent as compensation from the Government was taxable as income of the respondent and was not a capital receipt.	Decision
In the circumstances of the case, we leave the parties to bear their own costs of this Court as well as in the High Court.	Decision
13.	None
Appeal allowed.	None
