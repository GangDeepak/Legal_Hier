5.	None
It is alleged inter alia that Bhopal was made Capital of Madhya Pradesh on November 1, 1956.	Facts
We were referred to the report of the States Reorganisation Commission, 1955.	Facts
Para 486 (page 132) states486.	Facts
The new State, which can appropriately be described, as Madhya Pradesh, will be a compact unit.	Facts
It will bring almost the whole of Bundalkhand and Baghelkhand under one administration.	Facts
Jabalpur will be situated at a central place in this unit and has or will soon have some important facilities like water supply and availability of electrical power.	Facts
It will, in our opinion be a suitable capital.	None
This report was submitted on September 30, 1955.	None
It is quite clear from this para that on the date of the report the proposed capital was Jabalpur and there could thus be no speculation in land before the announcement of Bhopal as capital.	Facts
6.	None
In view of these facts, it is submitted in ground (viii) of the petition that the impugned Act violates Art.	Arguments of Petitioner
14 of the Constitution as there is no rational classification on the basis of which the prices of Bhopal area have not been determined by the principle by which the market prices of other places would be determined.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that there can be no rational basis to differentiate between Bhopal and other areas for award of compensation merely because Bhopal was made Capital.	Arguments of Petitioner
The theory that in view of Capital, there were speculative prices at Bhopal and the prices at any given time might not reflect the real price, is neither rational nor reasonable.	Arguments of Petitioner
It also alleged that the date, October 1, 1955, is an arbitrary date for the purpose of fixing the market value.	Arguments of Petitioner
7. The only reply given to this ground is contained in para 21 of the counter affidavit on behalf of the State wherein it is statedWith reference to ground (viii), of the petition, I deny that the Amendment Act infringes any fundamental right of the petitioner and in particular Article 14 of the Constitution 8.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Advocate General was unable to point out to us any material to show that there was any expectation or speculation on or about the Ist October, 1955 that Bhopal would be the Capital of Madhya Pradesh.	Reasoning
If this fact had been established, it may have been reasonable to have fixed the date for the purpose of determining the market value as Ist October 1955.	Reasoning
9.	None
But this does not mean that for all time to come for any land acquired by the State for a capital, the date of announcement of the Capital would be the relevant date.	Reasoning
In this case, the acquisition was in 1962 and prices may have risen not only because of speculative dealings but because of general increase in prices throughout the State.	Reasoning
10.	None
In Satish Kumar v. State of M. P., AIR 1961 Madh Pra 280 the Madhya Pradesh High Court upheld the validity of the impugned Act.	Reasoning
The High Court justified the basis to differentiate the land located in Bhopal area thusIn support of this difference, it has been averred in the return filed by the State that in the reorganisation of the States, which was a political exigency, the fixation of the Capital at Bhopal was an accident not due to any economic or industrial.	Reasoning
reasons that when it was decided to locate the Capital of the State in the underdeveloped town, there was heavy speculation in land prices, and that, therefore, these artificially inflated prices could not be taken as a proper basis for fixing, the real marketvalue of the property.	None
The amendments themselves indicate that it was because of the location of the Capital at Bhopal that they had to be made.	None
Now, it cannot be denied that whenever a capital or a big industry is located in a town or even in a city, land values are suddenly pushed up by prospective sellers and the increase in them during the interregnum between the date when it is known that the town will become more important and the date of acquisition of land may not represent its real value.	Reasoning
The prospect of acquisition of vast areas of private lands in connection with a capital or industrial project in town always gives rise to speculative dealings in lands in the town.	Reasoning
When such speculative dealings occur it is not unreasonable and improper to compute the marketvalue of the land with reference to a date proximate to the date of acquisition so as to exclude speculative rise in determining the market value of the land.	None
On the material on record it is impossible for us to hold that in this case there has been a discrimination in the matter of compensation between land acquired in Bhopal area and other areas in the State.	None
The classification between land in Bhopal area and other parts of the State is with reason and reasonable, and is for the purpose of enabling the State to acquire land at a reasonable price in Bhopal for the construction of the Capital.	Reasoning
In our view, the amendments are not hit by Article 14 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
11.	None
With respect, the High Court has not examined the question of the validity of the reason for fixing the relevant date as October 1, 1955.	Reasoning
There is no material on the record to show that on October 1, 1955, it was known that Bhopal may be the Capital of the State or that there was speculation because of this fact.	Reasoning
12.	None
We have in the judgment delivered in Nagpur Improvement Trust v. Vithal Rao, Civil Appeal No. 2139 of 1968, D  11121972 (reported in AIR 1973 SC 689 ) examined Art.	Reasoning
14 and its implications as far as land acquisition is concerned.	Reasoning
In our view, in the light of that judgment, the petition must be allowed.	Reasoning
13.	None
In the result, the petition is allowed with costs and it is declared that Sections 3 and 4 of the impugned Act are hit by the provisions of Art.	Decision
14 of the Constitution.	Decision
14.	None
Appeal allowed.	Decision
