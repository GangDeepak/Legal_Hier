Case of respondent plaintiff is that site no.53 was sold by Madhavan Pillai (PW2) to plaintiff by way of a registered sale deed dated 16.06.1975.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of his claim of ownership and possession in site no.53, plaintiff had produced judgment and decree of the earlier suit in O. S. No.1756 of 1982 dated 26.08.1985 in his favour restraining the defendants from interfering with his peaceful possession of the suit property which was subsequently confirmed by the High Court in R.F.A. No.86 of 1986 by judgment dated 21.02.1986.	Arguments of Respondent
Based on the evidence of respondent plaintiff (PW1), Madhavan Pillai (PW2) and the decree in O.S.No.1756 of 1982, the trial court held that the respondent plaintiff is the owner of the property in site no.53 and granted permanent injunction.	Arguments of Respondent
Even though defendants challenged the judgment in favour of respondent plaintiff with respect to site no.53, before the High Court, it was stated before us that there is no serious dispute between the parties with respect to site no.53.4.	Arguments of Respondent
Site No.47	Facts
So far as site no.47 is concerned, Plaintiff had produced an agreement of sale dated 09.09.1986, by virtue of which Madhavan Pillai (PW2) agreed to sell site no.47 to the plaintiff for a consideration of Rs. 48,000/ and the entire sale consideration of Rs. 48,000/ had been paid to Madhavan Pillai.	Facts
But plaintiff stated that due to ban of registration of revenue sites, Madhavan Pillai (PW2) executed a registered general power of attorney dated 03.05.1988 in favour of plaintiff and that pursuant to the general power of attorney, plaintiff has been in possession and enjoyment of site no.47.	Facts
As plaintiffs case was not supported by a registered sale deed, the trial court declined to accept the claim of plaintiff with respect to site no.475.	Facts
In appeal, the High Court noted that the trial court failed to take into consideration the testimony of Madhavan Pillai (PW2) wherein he deposed to the effect that he agreed to sell site no.47 to plaintiff and that he had executed a registered general power of attorney dated 03.05.1988.	Facts
PW2Madhavan Pillai had also stated that the sale deed could not be executed as there was a ban of registration of revenue sites.	None
Madhavan Pillai stated that in 39 guntas of land which he had purchased from the defendants, he formed a layout, 20 feet road was proposed in between sites no.53 and 47.	Facts
PW2 further stated that since Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) formed the road in the western portion of Sy. No.255, the road in between sites no.47 and 53 was given up and the revised layout plan for 20 feet road was formed (Ex.P9).	Facts
Madhavan Pillai stated that respondent plaintiff is in possession of sites no.47 and 53.	Facts
Based on the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 and the general power of attorney (Ex.P7), the High Court held that the plaintiff is in possession of site no.47 and granted permanent injunction in favour of the plaintiff.6.	Facts
Though the appellants defendants disputed the title and possession of the plaintiff over site no.47, the defendants have merely averred that the documents relied upon by the plaintiff that is agreement of sale (09.09.1986) and general power of attorney (03.05.1988) are forged and not acceptable.	Facts
Nothing further has been elicited from PW2 to show that he had no right to sell site no.47 to the plaintiff.	Facts
The defendants went to the extent of denying the identity of Madhavan PIllai (PW2).	Facts
Be it noted, the plaintiffs suit O.S.No.424 of 1995 was only for permanent injunction in which the plaintiff is only required to prove that he is in lawful possession of the suit property.	Facts
The High Court based upon the general power of attorney and the evidence of PW2 held in favour of plaintiff that he is in possession of site no.47.	Facts
These findings of fact cannot be said to be perverse warranting interference.7.	Facts
Contention of appellants defendants is that site no.47 is not covered under the sale deed in favour of Madhavan Pillai (21.04.1975).	Arguments of Petitioner
Further contention of appellants is that merely on the basis of registered power of attorney, title and ownership of immovable property (site no.47) could not have been transferred to the plaintiff.	Arguments of Petitioner
We refrain from going into the merits of this contention for two reasons.	Arguments of Petitioner
Firstly, since the present suit and further appeal thereon emanates from the suit pertaining to permanent injunction where the touchstone upon which the suit has to be decided is lawful possession and not ownership.	Arguments of Petitioner
Secondly, appellants defendants have filed separate suit in O.S.No.5327 of 1995 against Madhavan Pillai and the respondents, for a declaration that appellants are the owners of B Schedule property thereon (which includes site no.47) and other reliefs.	Arguments of Petitioner
As seen from the additional documents filed before us, the said suit has been dismissed on 17.12.2016 against which an appeal is said to have been filed and pending.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, we deem it appropriate, not to express any opinion on the question of title and ownership of respondent plaintiff on the basis of registered general power of attorney.8.	Arguments of Petitioner
The present appeal arises out of the suit filed by plaintiff respondent for permanent injunction and the courts below rightly decided the same on the question of possession.	Reasoning
Based on the general power of attorney and the evidence of PWs 1 and 2, the High Court rightly held that the plaintiff is in possession and we do not find any reason warranting interference.9.	Reasoning
In the result, the appeal is dismissed.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
