The correctness of the judgment of the High Court is challenged in this appeal by special leave.2.	Facts
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the award should be set aside for three reasons.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted, firstly, that there were errors of law apparent on the face of the award.	None
Now, the claim of the respondent consisted of two items.	Arguments of Respondent
The first item of claim was Rs. 84,00620 for loss on resale of 176 bales.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents case was that 176 bales were resold with the consent of the appellant and under the authority given by it in a letter, dated July 10, 1948.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellants case was that no authority for the resale of all the 176 bales was given by the letter and the resale was not made with its consent.	Arguments of Respondent
The second item of claim was for Rs. 88,849140 on account of the price of 461/2 bales.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents case was that 461/2 bales were sold and the property in the goods had passed to the appellant on June 30, 1948 and yet the appellant had not taken delivery of the bales.	None
The appellants case was that the contract in respect of 461/2 bales remained executory and it stood cancelled on the passing of the freezing order, dated July 30, 1948 by the Textile Commissioner, Indore, under Clause 25 (b) of the Indore Cotton Textiles (Control) Order, 1948, whereby the respondent was directed not to deliver any cloth or yarn from the Mills, premises.	None
The appellant submitted that, in any event, having regard to this freezing order it should not be held liable for the full price of 461/2 bales and on its giving up its claim to the bales, should be made liable for only the difference between the contract price and the market price.	Arguments of Petitioner
On a consideration of the contentions, and submissions of the parties, the arbitrator directed the appellant to pay Rs. 1,17,10879 and to give up its claim to 461/2 bales.	None
As the respondent was allowed to retain the bales, the arbitrator passed a lump sum award for Rs. 1,17,10879 only in respect of both items of the respondents claim.	None
The arbitrator could give a lump sum award.	None
He was not bound to give a separate award for each claim.	None
His award on both fact and law is final.	None
There is no appeal from his verdict.	None
The Court cannot review his award and correct any mistake in his adjudication, unless an objection to the legality of the award is apparent on that face of it.	None
In Champsey Bhara and Co. v. Jivraj Balloo Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., 50 Ind App 324 (AIR 1923 PC 66), the Privy Council stated An error in law on the face of the award means, in Their Lordships view, that you can find in the award or a document actually incorporated thereto, as for instance a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which you can then say is erroneous.	None
In the present case, the arbitrator gave no reason for the award.	Reasoning
We do not find in the award any legal proposition which is the basis of the award, far less a legal proposition which is erroneous.	Reasoning
It is not possible to say from the award that the arbitrator was under a misconception of law.	Reasoning
The contention that there are errors of law on the face of the award is rejected.3.	None
Counsel then submitted that by amending an issue behind the back of the appellant, the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct.	Arguments of Petitioner
This contention has no force.	None
The arbitrator had raised two issues.	None
The second issue referred to the respondents claim in respect of 461/2 bales as a claim for loss in respect of the bales.	None
At the time of the writing of the award, the arbitrator corrected this issue so as to show that the claim was for the price of the bales.	None
By this Amendment, the appellant suffered no prejudice.	None
The parties well knew that the respondent claimed the price of 461/2 bales and fought the case before the arbitrator on that footing.4.	None
The last objection to the award is that the arbitrator had no power to award interest during the pendency of the suit.	None
In support of this objection, counsel for the appellant relied upon the following observations of Bose, J., in Thawardas Pherumal v. Union of India, 19552	None
SCR 48 at p. 65 (AIR 1955 SC 468 at p. 478)It was suggested that at least interest from the date of suit could be awarded on the analogy of S. 34 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908.	None
But S. 34 does not apply because an arbitrator is not a Court within the meaning of the Code nor does the Code apply to arbitrators, and, but for S. 34, even a Court would not have the power to give interest after the suit.	None
This was, therefore, also rightly struck out from the award.	None
These observations divorced from their context lend colour to the argument that the arbitrator has no power to award pendente life interest.	None
But, in later cases, this Court has pointed out that the observations in Thawardass case, 19552 SCR 48 (AIR 1955 SC 468 ), were not intended to lay down such a broad and unqualified proposition, see Nachiappa Chettiar v Subramaniam Chettiar, 19602 SCR 209 at p. 238 (AIR 1960 SC 307 at p 320), Satinder Singh v. Umrao Singh, 19613 SCR 676 at p. 695 (AIR 1961 SC 908 at p. 916).	None
The relevant facts regarding the claim for interest in Thawardass case, 19552 SCR 48 (AIR 1955 SC 468 ) will be found at pp.	None
64 to 66 of the Report (SCR) (at pp.	None
477 to 478 of AIR) and in Paras. 2, 17 and 24 of the judgment of the Patna High Court reported in Union of India v. Premchand Satram Das, AIR 1951 Pat 201 at pp. 204205.	None
The arbitrator awarded interest on unliquidated damages for a period before the reference to arbitration and also for a period subsequent to the reference.	Reasoning
The High Court set aside the award regarding interest on the ground that the claim for interest was not referred to arbitration and the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim.	Reasoning
In this Court, counsel for the claimant contended that the arbitrator had statutory power under the Interest Act of 1839 to award the interest and, in any event, he had power to award interest during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings under S. 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.	Reasoning
Bose, J. rejected this contention.	Reasoning
It will be noticed that the judgment of this Court in Thawardass case, 19552 SCR 48 (AIR 1955 SC 468 ), is silent on the question whether the arbitrator can award interest during the pendency of arbitration proceedings if the claim regarding interest is referred to arbitration.	Reasoning
In the present case, all the disputes in the suit were referred to the arbitrator for his decision.	Reasoning
One of the disputes in the suit was whether the respondent was entitled to pendente life interest.	Reasoning
The arbitrator could decide the dispute and he could award pendente lite interest just as a Court could do so under S. 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure.	Reasoning
Though, in terms, S. 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure does not apply to arbitrations, it was an implied term of the reference in the suit that the arbitrator would decide the dispute according to law and would give such relief with regard to pendente life interest as the Court could give if it decided the dispute.	Reasoning
This power of the arbitrator was not fettered either by the arbitration agreement or by the Arbitration Act, 1940.	Reasoning
The contention that in an arbitration in a suit the arbitrator had no power to award pendente lite interest must be rejected.5.	Decision
In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.6.	Decision
Appeal dismissed.	None
