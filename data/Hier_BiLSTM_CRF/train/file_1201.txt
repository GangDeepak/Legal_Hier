None
After about 24 years, the order of allotment was stayed and the Company was called upon to show cause as to why the land should not be forfeited and the amount of Rs.14,11,45,851/ towards unearned income be not charged as it violated the terms and conditions of the order of allotment by granting rights to the developers for the construction of houses and selling them after development, thereby benefiting to a large extent.

There is no allegation of breach of any terms and conditions of the order of allotment in regard to rest of the land which has not been declared surplus.	None
From the housing scheme dated 11.1.1984 it is apparent that the State Government allowed the change in its utilization for developmental purposes other than stipulated.	None
By the said housing scheme dated 11.1.1984 the excess land was allowed to be developed for construction of the houses for the weaker sections for school, shopping centre, dispensary, recreationary ground, etc.	None

This was intimated to the State Government which agreed to the proposal, as is clear from the State Governments letter dated 2.12.1989 issued from the Department of Housing and Special Assistance, Government of Maharashtra, Bombay.	None
The State Government at the request of the Developer, M s Eversmile Construction Company Pvt. Ltd. also extended the period of completion for the housing scheme, vide letter dated 25th June, 1991.	None
We, therefore, hold that the State Government allowed the Company to change the use of the land and to develop the surplus land for purposes other than that for which the said land was originally allotted and such permission is in accordance with the terms and conditions as mentioned in the order of allotment dated 20.1.1969.	Reasoning
The first question is thus answered in negative, in favour of the company.29.	Reasoning
Turning now to the second question, we find that the order of allotment dated 20.1.1969 and the scheme dated 11.1.1984 do not stipulate any charge on the unearned income of the Company.	Reasoning
The respondents have failed to show the provision under which the Company is required to pay 50 of its unearned income.	Reasoning
The communication dated 2.12.1991 between the Additional Secretary of the State and the Competent Authority discloses the entitlement of the State to charge part of the unearned income in certain cases where lands have been provided to the industrial units after acquiring land under the Urban Land Ceiling Act but part of which is subsequently declared surplus under the Urban Land Ceiling Act but allowed to be retained.	None
As per the said guideline, in case, the land acquired is declared excess but allowed to be retained by a scheme framed under Section 21, then 50 of the unearned income is to be recovered subject to the conditions prescribed therein which reads as follows NO.ULC 1089 (0007) D13Housing Special Assistance DepartmentMantrallay, Mumbai 400 032Date 2.12.91.ToThe Additional Collector Competent Authority,Mumbai (Pune)The Dy.
