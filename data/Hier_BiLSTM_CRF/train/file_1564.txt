Respondent raised an industrial dispute.	Facts
By reason of an Award dated 16.7.1996, the Labour Court despite finding that the enquiry was fairly conducted opined that the punishment inflicted on the respondent was disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct committed by him, stating Therefore, it would not be just and proper to impose the severe punishment of the termination from the service but keeping in view the proved misconduct on the part of the applicant this court could amend the penalty keeping in view the provisions of Section 11(A) of the Industrial Disputes Act and as per the facts and circumstances of the case it would be just and proper that the punishment of the stoppage of two grade increments with cumulative effect be awarded and the same would be made effective from the date of inspection i.e. 8.2.84 and further that the applicant would not be entitled of the back wages.	Facts
That he would be reinstated in the service in continuation of his service as if he has not been terminated from the service of the corporation.	Facts

Mr. B.K. Satija, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, would contend that this Court should not interfere with the impugned judgment as imposition of the punishment of dismissal from service having regard to the guidelines issued by the Corporation itself was wholly disproportionate to the charges of misconduct framed against the respondent.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel in this connection would draw our attention to the statement made in the counter affidavit, which reads as under It is respectfully submitted that the Corporation in number of standing orders has taken decision in regard to awarding financial punishment, where the Conductor is carrying the passengers without ticket.

It is respectfully submitted that the petitioner Corporation has issued number of semi Government order, where the decision to impose financial punishment was decided by the Corporation and the cases pertaining to traveling without ticket were settled imposing financial punishment upon the employee workman.	Arguments of Respondent
Our attention was also drawn to a corrigendum issued on 24.7.1982, the relevant portion whereof reads as under Recently circular No. 625 dt.05.06.1982 was issued by the General Manager for charge of full route fare from the without ticket passengers, because correct information regarding journey undertaken was not being provided by the passengers as well as by the conductors to conceal fraudulent activities.	None
During the last meeting of the Divisional Managers, clarification was sought with regard to certain points to enable the officers and inspectorial staff to implement the directions imparted in the circular under reference.	None
Further, instructions in this regard are imparted as under1.	None
The cases where the conductor has realized fare, but has not issued tickets, it shall be presumed that the passenger had been undertaking journey from the originating point of the bus to the terminal point and the conductor had realized fare for the journey being undertaken by the passenger.	None
Hence, full fare of the route along with equal penalty or Rs.5/ whichever is more, shall be chargeable from the conductor.	None
Our attention was also drawn to the Office Order dated 12.01.2006, the relevant portion whereof reads as under Nigam has decided to prefer a Special Leave Petition before the Honble Supreme Court against order dt.	None
16.11.2005 passed by Honble High Court of Rajasthan Bench at Jaipur and it has also been decided that Sh.	None
Kamruddin S o	None

Therefore, Kamruddin S o Sh.	None
Sikandar Khan, ExConductor, Vyavar Depot in pursuance of order dt. 04.02.2003 passed by learned Single Judge of the Honble High Court Bench at Jaipur and order dt.	None
16.11.2005 passed by Division Bench of the High Court of Rajasthan at Jaipur and compliance of Award dt.	None

Learned counsel furthermore urged that as in implementation of the said Award passed by the Labour Court as affirmed by the High Court, respondent had been reinstated in service by an office order dated 12.1.2006 and his services having been terminated again by an order dated 2.6.2006 in view of the order of stay granted this Court, this Court may restore the order passed by the Labour Court.	None
It is not a case where the misconduct against the respondent had not been proved.	Reasoning
It is also not a case where the domestic enquiry was found to have been conducted in an unfair manner or contrary to the principles of natural justice.	Reasoning
The services of the respondent had been terminated while the period of probation was not over.	Reasoning
As a conductor, his performance during the period of probation was found to be unsatisfactory.	Reasoning
It is not in dispute that a disciplinary proceeding was initiated against him while he was found to have committed similar misconduct for the fifth time.	Reasoning
It is also beyond any doubt or dispute that he had also been served with a letter of warning.10.	Reasoning
The power of Labour Court and or Industrial Tribunal in terms of Section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 to interfere with the quantum of punishment although cannot be denied, but it is also a well settled principle of law that the said power should be exercised judiciously.	Reasoning
The Labour Court relied upon the decision of this Court in Bhagyo Mal (supra) wherein the High Court allowed back wages to the workman concerned.	None
This Court in the facts and circumstances of the case found the order of the High Court to be selfcontradictory, stating When the High Court had found that the respondent  employee deserved punishment on account of his misconduct, the High Court could not have rewarded the employee by granting him the back wages particularly when the Tribunal had converted the order of dismissal into that of the stoppage of two increments with cumulative effect.	None
We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside that part of the order of the High Court whereby the respondent  employee has been given the benefit of back wages.	None
The rest of the order is maintained.	None
We fail to understand as to how the said decision advanced the case of the respondent.	None
The question with regard to imposition of appropriate punishment upon a conductor of a bus belonging to a corporation constituted under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950 came up for consideration before this Court in Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation vs. B.S. Hullikatti (2001) 2 SCC 574 , wherein it was held On the facts as found by the Labour Court and the High Court, it is evident that there was a shortcharging of the fare by the respondent from as many as 35 passengers.	None
We are informed that the respondent had been in service as a Conductor for nearly 22 years.	None
It is difficult to believe that he did not know what was the correct fare which was to be charged.	None
Furthermore, the appellant had during the disciplinary proceedings taken into account the fact that the respondent had been found guilty for as many as 36 times on different dates.	None
Be that as it may, the principle of res ipsa loquitur, namely, the facts speak for themselves, is clearly applicable in the instant case.	None
Charging 50 paise per ticket less from as many as 35 passengers could only be to get financial benefit by the Conductor.	None
This act was either dishonest or was so grossly negligent that the respondent was not fit to be retained as a Conductor because such action or inaction of his is bound to result in financial loss to the appellantCorporation.6.	None
It is misplaced sympathy by the Labour Courts in such cases when on checking it is found that the Bus Conductors have either not issued tickets to a large number of passengers, though they should have, or have issued tickets of a lower denomination knowing fully well the correct fare to be charged.	None
It is the responsibility of the Bus Conductors to collect the correct fare from the passengers and deposit the same with the Company.	None
They act in a fiduciary capacity and it would be a case of gross misconduct if knowingly they do not collect any fare or the correct amount of fare.	None
A three judge Bench of this Court in Regional Manager, RSRTC vs. Ghanshyam Sharma (2002) 10 SCC 330 , reiterated the said principle, stating This Court in Karnataka SRTC v. B.S. Hullikatti has held that in such cases where the bus conductors carry passengers without ticket or issue tickets at a less rate than the proper rate, the said acts would inter alia amount to either being a case of dishonesty or of gross negligence and such conductors were not fit to be retained in service because such inaction or action on the part of the conductors results in financial loss to the Road Transport Corporation.	None
This Court was firmly of the opinion that in cases like the present, orders of dismissal should not be set aside.5.	None
Furthermore, we agree with the observations of the Single Judge in the present case that the Labour Court was not justified in interfering with the punishment of dismissal.	None
Though under Section 11A the Labour Court has jurisdiction and powers to interfere with the quantum of punishment, however the discretion has to be used judiciously.	None
When the main duty or function of the conductor is to issue tickets and collect fare and then deposit the same with the Road Transport Corporation and when a conductor fails to do so, then it will be misplaced sympathy to order his reinstatement instead of dismissal.	None
Recently in Uttaranchal Transport Corporation vs. Sanjay Kumar Nautiyal 2008 (12) SCC 131 , Hullikatti (supra) has been followed.	None
Standing Order No. 36 whereto our attention has been drawn merely provides for different nature of penalties which can be imposed on a worker stating that penalties specified at Serial Nos.5 to 7 therein would be appealable.	Reasoning
A corrigendum thereto was issued on 24.7.1982 by way of clarification with regard to the full route fare as contained in Circular No. 625 dated 5.6.1982.	Reasoning
The said corrigendum has nothing to do with the nature or quantum of penalty.	Reasoning
The same does not provide for a substitution of the penalty provided for in the Certified Standing Order.	Reasoning
In any event, Certified Standing Order would prevail over such circulars.13.	Reasoning
It may be true that in execution of the Award passed by the Labour Court, for a short time respondent was put back in service.	Reasoning
This Court, however, as indicated hereinbefore, stayed the operation of the judgment by reason whereof Award as also the judgment of the High Court became nonoperational.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, of the opinion that by itself that may not be a ground to refrain ourselves from following the authoritative binding precedents.14.	Reasoning
For the aforementioned reasons, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained.	Decision
It is set aside accordingly.	Decision
The appeal is allowed.	Decision
However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.	Decision
