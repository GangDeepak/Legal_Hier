 TULZAPURKAR, J.1.	None
The principal question raised for our determination in these appeals is Whether on its proper construction the certified Standing Order 17 provides for second opportunity being given to a workman after conclusion of the inquiry into his misconduct and before inflicting on him the punishment of dismissal and if so whether the enquiry gets vitiated by not affording him such opportunity?2.	Issue
Facts giving rise to the question may be stated.	Facts

Petition No. 129 of 1970) contending that the Arbitrator had misconstrued Standing Order No. 17 and that no second opportunity was required to be given to the Respondents and that in the alternative the interference with the punishment of dismissal in respect of Rama Shanker and Barmapradhan was erroneous while another writ petition (Misc.	Facts
Petition No. 365 of 1970) was filed by the Respondents against the punishments that were awarded to each one of them the High Court by its judgment dated 27th July, 1972 confirmed the Award of the Arbitrator by dismissing both the writ petitions.	Facts
The Appellant has come up in appeal (being Civil Appeal No. 209/73) by special leave challenging the interference with the dismissal of Rama Shanker and Burma Pradhan while the Respondents have preferred their appeal (being Civil Appeal No. 1140 of 1974) on a Certificate grant ed by the High Court challenging the punishments operating against each one of them.	Facts
At this stage it may be stated that as regards Emmanual and Mohd.	Facts
Rauf the matter has been compromised between the parties which has already been re corded by this Court with the result that Civil Appeal No. 1140 of 1974 in so far as their dismissal is concerned no longer survives and the same needs to be dealt with by us only as regards back wages that have been denied to Rama Shanker and Burmapradhan.4.	Facts
In support of civil Appeal No. 209 of 1973 Counsel for the Appellant raised three contentions before us.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the first place, he contended that the learned Arbitrator as well as the High Court have erroneously construed the certified Standing order No. 17 as requiring a second opportunity being given to a workman at the conclusion of the enquiry into his misconduct and before inflicting upon him the punishment of dismissal he urged that the concept of secon d opportunity being given to a delinquent which obtained under sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 or Art.	Arguments of Petitioner
311 of the Constitution prior to the insertion of the Proviso to Article 311 (2) could not be invoked or applied to the instant case nor was such second opportunity any requirement of the ordinary law of the land or of Industrial law and in this behalf reliance was placed on two decisions of this Court in Hamdard Dawakhana case and in Saharanpur Light Rly, case.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel urged that on proper construction of the Standing order it should have been held that no second opportunity was contemplated thereunder and therefore the finding that the enquiry was vitiated deserved to be set aside and according to hi m if the enquiry was valid and was not vitiated the punishment of dismissal imposed on Rama Shanker and Barmapradhan could not be interfered with.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the alternative counsel contended that assuming that the enquiry was vitiated for the reason mentioned by the Arbitrator even than once serious misconduct was proved by leading evidence before the learned Arbitrator it was not open to him to interfere with the punishment of dismissal unless the punishment was so harsh as to smack of victimisation.	Arguments of Respondent
In the further alternative counsel contended that assuming that the Arbitrator had power to interfere with the punishment in the instant case having to the facts and circumstances he was not justified in setting aside the dismissal of Rama Shanker and Barmapradhan especially on the ground on which he did so namely, that the conduct of Shri Emmanual and Mohd.	Arguments of Respondent
Rauf was more grave than that of Rama Shanker and Barmapradhan while fomenting the strike counsel urged that passively taking part in the strike was distinguishable from the more serious misconduct of fomenting or inciting the strike and all the respondents were found guilty by the learned Arbitrator of such serious misconduct and as such no distinction on the distinction on the basis indicated between the two sets of workmen should have been made in the matter of punishment, on the other hand counsel for the Respondents urged that Standing order No. 17 had been properly cons trued by the Arbitrator and the High Court and that construction should be upheld and in any case if two constructions were reasonably possible no interference by this Court was called for and counsel in that behalf relied upon the decision Agani (W.M.) v. Badri Das and ors.	Arguments of Respondent
Counsel further urged that once the enquiry got vitiated the entire field of determining the misconduct as also the punishment therefore became open and the Arbitrator had jurisdiction and power to consider both the aspects and that the Arbitrator in the facts and circumstances of the case had justifiably interfered with the dismissal of Rama Shanker and Barmapradhan and had directed their reinstatement.	Arguments of Respondent
From the rival contentions summarised above it will appear clear that the real question that arises in these appeals is, does the certified Standing order No. 17 provide for second opportunity being given to a workman to show cause against the proposed punishment of dismissal, for, it was not disputed before us that if no such second opportunity is contemplated by it then the only ground on which the inquiry has been held to be invalid by the learned Arbitrator and the High Court would disappear and the Arbitrator could not have entered into merits of the case or interfered with the punishment of dismissal inflicted upon Rama Shanker and Barmapradhan.	None
The question obviously depends upon the proper construction to be placed on said S.O. 17.	None
It may be stated that the certified S.O. 16 enlists several acts or omissions that constitute misconduct and striking work either singly or with other workers without giving 14 days previous notice, inciting whilst on the premises and worker to strike work and indulging in a Gherao, which would amount to an act subversive of discipline or efficiency are obviously included therein.	None
S.O. 17 which deals with punishments and procedure therefore runs thus17.	None
A worker may be suspended for a period not exceeding 4 days or fined in accordance with the Payment of Wages Act or dismissed without notice or any compensation in lieu of notice it found guilty of misconduct defined in Standing order No. 16.All orders of suspension and fines shall be in writing setting out the misconduct for which the punishment is awarded.	None
No officer below the rank of the Head of Department shall award the above punishmentAll dismissal order shall be passed by the Manager or Acting , Manager who shall do so after giving accuse an opportunity to offer any explanation.	None
Due consideration to the gravity of the misconduct and the previous record of the worker shall be given in awarding the maximum punishment.	None
In the event of a discharge of dismissal, the worker shall be paid off within the second working day following the discharge or dismissal.	None
5.	None
The question is whether when paragraph 3 of the S.O. says all dismissal orders shall be passed by the Manager or Acting Manager who shall do so after giving the accused an opportunity to offer any explanation, it contemplates giving of a second opportunity to the delinquent to show cause against the proposed punishment of dismissal after he has been found guilty or the opportunity spoken of is the opportunity to meet the charges in the domestic inquiry ?	None
6.	None
At the outset the egal position as has been clarified by this Court in the Saharanpur Light Railway Co.s case (supra) may be stated.	None
In the context of certain modification sought to be introduced in a Standing order requiring a second show cause notice this Court has observed thus As regards the modification requiring a second show cause notice, neither the ordinary law of the land nor the industrial law requires an employer to give such a notice.	None
In none of the decisions given by the Courts or the Tribunals , such a second show cause notice in the case of removal has ever been demand or considered necessary.	None
The only class of cases where such a notice has been held to be necessary are those arising under Art.	None
311.	None
Even that has now been removed by the recent amendment of that Article.	None
To import such a retirement from Art.	None
311 in industrial matters does not appear to be either necessary or proper and.	None
would be equating industrial employees with civil servants.	None
In our view, there is no justification or any principle for such equation.	None
Besides, such a requirement would unnecessarily prolong disciplinary enquiries which in the interest of industrial peace should be disposed of in short time as possible.	None
In our view it is not possible to consider this modification as justifiable either on the ground of reasonableness of fairness and should therefore be set aside.7.	None
It is thus clear neither under the ordinary law of the land nor under industrial law a second opportunity to show cause against the proposed punishment is necessary.	None
This, of course, does not mean that a Standing order may not pro vide for it but unless the Standing order provides for it.	None
either expressly or by necessary implication no inquiry which is otherwise fair and valid will be vitiated by nonaffording of such second opportunity.	None
The question is whether para 3 of the Standing order No. 17 provides for such second opportunity being given to the delinquent ?	None
The relevant words are all dismissal order shall be passed by the Manager alter giving the accused an opportunity to offer any explanation.	None
The underlined words are wholly inappropriate to convey the idea of a second hearing on opportunity on the question of punishment but appropriate in the context of seeking an explanation in regard to the alleged misconduct charged against him.	None
An explanation is to be called from the accused which suggests that the same is to be called for prior to the recording of finding that the delinquent is guilty of misconduct it is the alleged misconduct that is to be explained by him and not the proposed punishment.	None
On a plain reading of the relevant words no second opportunity of showing cause against the proposed punishment is contemplated either expressly or by necessary implication.	None
In other words, it is clear to us that the opport unity spoken of by para 3 OE S.O. 17 is the opportunity to be given to the delinquent to meet the charge framed against him.	None
In this connection it will be pertinent to mention that the concerned S.O. was framed and came into force on March 1, 194 6 and was duly certified on October 16, 1954 under the Industrial employment (Standing orders) Act, 1946 i.e. prior to the enunciation of the law by Courts regarding the observance of the principles of natural justice such as issuance of a chargesheet, holding of an inquiry, opportunity to lead evidence, etc.	None
and it is wellknown that after the enunciation of these principles model standing orders have been framed to provide for the detailed steps required to be undertaken during a domestic inquiry.	None
Since the Instant Standing order was certified prior to the formulation of the above principles it merely contains a bald provision for giving the accused an opportunity to offer any explanation.	Reasoning
In other words, different stages in domestic inquiry were never in the contemplation of the framers of the S.O.	Reasoning
That being the position it would be difficult to attribute any intention to the framers thereof to provide for a second opportunity being given to the delinquent of showing cause against the proposed punishment.	Reasoning
The latter part of para 3 merely casts a unilateral obligation on concerned authority or the officer to give due consideration to the gravity of the misconduct and the previous record of the delinquent in awarding the maximum punishment.	Reasoning
It is true that the Arbitrator has undoubtedly taken the view that the opportunity spoken of by para 3 does not refer to the opportunity to meet the charges but refer s to the further opportunity being given to the delinquent to show cause against the graver punishment of dismissal that may be proposed to be inflicted on him.	Reasoning
But for reaching such a conclusion he has resorted to some involved reasoning which i s not warranted by the Standing order if read as a whole.	Reasoning
According to him in the earlier paragraph which speaks of awarding lighter punishment there is no reference to any opportunity being given to meet the charges but no punishment not eve n lighter punishment can be inflicted without inquiry being held according to the principles of natural justice and if such an inquiry as implicit in cases of lighter punishments it would be so in cases of graver punishment like dismissal and since specific mention of opportunity as made in cases of graver punishment in the relevant sentence para 3 it must have a meaning and the words cannot be considered a surpulsage and, therefore, the opportunity mentioned in the relevant sentence of para 3 refers to the second opportunity being given to the delinquent at the stage of inflicting the punishment of dismissal.	Reasoning
The High Court has confirmed the view of the basis that the first part of the Standing order deals with several punishments and requires finding of guilt in respect of each one of them and this procedure is, therefore, different from that which has been contemplated in the last part of the Standing order and that last part deals only with t	Reasoning
he punishment of dismissal and for that punishment alone makes a special provision that no order awarding that punishment will be passed unless the Manager gives an opportunity to a workman to offer his explanation.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the view of the Arbitrator as also the view of the High Court proceed on an assumption that the Standing Order No. 17 deals with two different stages concerning disciplinary proceedings against a delinquent, first holding of a departmental inquiry into the charges where principles of natural justice must be implied and second the infliction of graver punishment before awarding which opportunity to show cause has been provided for but the plain reading of the Standing Order read as a whole does not warrant any such assumption and, therefore, we do not feel that the construction placed on Standing Order No. 17 by the Arbitrator or the High Court is possible much less reasonably possible.	Reasoning
The ratio of this Courts decision in Agnani (W.M.) v. Badri Das Ors.	Reasoning
(supra) is, therefore, not attracted.	Reasoning
In view of the construction which we are placing on S.O. No. 17, it will be clear that the only ground on which inquiry was held to be invalid by the Arbitrator and by the High Court must disappear.	Reasoning
Admittedly, opportunity to offer explanation in regard to the alleged misconduct was not only afforded but was availed of by the concerned four workers (including Rama Shankar and Burma) Pradhan) by submitting their written explanations to the Manager whereafter the departmental inquiry was held by H.S. Mathur.	Reasoning
In other words S.O. 17 was fully complied with and what is more the Arbitrator has held that the inquiry was otherwise fair and valid.	Reasoning
The solitary ground on which the inquiry was held to be invalid having disappeared it must follow that the Arbitrator had no Jurisdiction to enter into the merits of the case or interfere with the punishment of dismissal inflicted upon Rama Shankar and Burma Pradhan.	Reasoning
That part of the Arbitrators award which has been confirmed by the High Court is, therefore, set aside.	Decision
The alternative contentions raised by counsel for the Management in these appeals do not survive.	Decision
C.A.	Decision
No. 209 of 1973 ( filed by the Management) is allowed and C.A. No. 1140 of 1974 (filed by the two workmen Rama Shankar and Burmapradhan) is dismissed.	Decision
There will be no order as to costs.8.	None
C.A. 209/72 allowed and CA.	Decision
1140/74 dismissed.	None
