Facts
It may also be indicated here that the appellant State of Rajasthan has filed additional objections.	Facts
In the additional objections raised in the affidavit of Sri Zakir Hussain Executive Engineer, Mahi Menu dam Division I, it has been alleged that one of the arbitrators, Sri A.B. Rohatgi was nominated by the respondent company but subsequent to his appointment as an arbitrator in the case in question and during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings the said Sri Rohatgi chose to accept the brief for the claimant before this Court in civil Appeal No. 4649 of 1984 which was heard by this Court on January 20, 1989.	Facts
Alleging that Sri Rohatgi did not disclose the fact of his accepting the brief for one of the parties it has been urged that in view of his identifying with the interest of one of the parties although in a different cause of action, the arbitrator lost the neutrality required to be maintained by an arbitrator and in the aforesaid facts, there has been serious misconduct on the part of the arbitrator thereby rendering his award invalid.	Facts
In the counter to such additional affidavit, the respondent had contended that the respective nominee of the parties was quite close to each of the parties and the nominee of the appellant Sri Lodha was appearing as a counsel for the appellant in various matters but as the arbitrators were men of unimpeachable character, both the parties did not object to their nominations.	Facts
Moreover, despite full knowledge of the fact that Sri Rohatgi had appeared for the respondent in a case, the appellant wilfully participated in the arbitration proceedings and invited adjudication.	Facts
Hence allegations of misconduct on that score cannot be permitted.	Facts
It has also been contended that such additional objection by way of an affidavit having been filed after 270 days, of the notice of filing the award in this Court such objection need not be considered at all being time barred under Article 119 of the Limitation Act.	Facts
On the scope and ambit of the power of interference by the Court with an award made by an arbitrator in a valid reference to arbitration, various decisions have been made from time to time by Law Courts of India including this Court and also by the Privy Council and the English Courts.	Facts
Both the parties have referred to such decisions in support of their respective contentions.	Facts
The factual contentions of the respective parties are proposed to be scrutinised and then the facts are proposed to be tested within the conspectus of judicial decisions governing the issues involved.	Facts
Before we deal with the various facts referred to by the respective parties, we may refer to the objection that has been raised by way of an additional affidavit affirmed by an executive engineer of the Government of Rajasthan, Shri Zakir Hussain, raising the question of misconduct of one of the arbitrators and in the written submissions filed by Shri Tulsi the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the State of Rajasthan, such misconduct and consequential disqualification of arbitrator has been specifically contended.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been alleged that one of the arbitrators, namely, Shri A.B. Rohatgi, disqualified himself from acting as an arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings in question by accepting a brief from the claimantrespondent in respect of a case though concerning a different cause of action, and representing the respondent claimant in this Court in civil Appeal No. 4649 of 1984 (Puri Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India).	Arguments of Respondent
The decision rendered in the said appeal is reported in AIR1989SC777 and in JT 1989 (1) 132 It has been alleged that the said Shri Rohatgi did not disclose the said fact before acceptance of the brief and also thereafter.	Arguments of Respondent
Such act is therefore, not only inconsistent with his duty as an arbitrator but the same tantamounts to misconduct thereby rendering the award invalid.	Arguments of Respondent
Disputing the allegation that the factum of Sri Rohatgis appearing in a case before this Court for the appellant was not known to the appellant it has been contended that the State of Rajasthan being represented by eminent lawyers were fully aware that Shri Rohatgi had appeared before this Court in an appeal on behalf of the respondentContractor.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been further contended that the said decision was mentioned by Sri Sarupriya and Shri Arun Jaitley, Senior Advocate, appearing for the State of Rajasthan before the Arbitrators and despite the knowledge of the appellant that Shri Rohatgi had represented the respondent in an appeal before this Court, no objection was raised at any point of time that by accepting such brief from the respondent, Shri Rohatgi had disqualified himself to act any further as an arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the respondent, the arbitration proceedings thereafter continued till August, 1992 but the appellant chose not to make any demurrer against the impartiality of the said arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
The plea taken by the deponent Shri Hussain that he was advised not to raise any objection against the arbitrator but to point out the aforesaid fact before this Court at a later stage has been criticised by Shri Sibal learned Counsel appearing for the respondent, as void of any substance.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been urged that such objection being hopelessly barred by limitation, cannot be considered.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been contended by Shri Sibal that even on merits, such objection is liable to be rejected.	Arguments of Respondent
The question of raising objection by the appellant about the validity of the award would not have arisen if the award was not made against the appellant, Shri Sibal has contended that even in spite of the knowledge of Shri Rohatgis acting as a counsel of the Respondent in an appeal, the appellant did not object to his functioning as an arbitrator but on the contrary the appellant had participated in the arbitration proceedings in all the sittings and made submissions before the arbitrators.	Arguments of Respondent
After taking a chance to succeed in the arbitration, the appellant cannot be permitted to raise any contention of misconduct of Shri Rohatgi on account of his acting as a counsel for the respondent in a case.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Sibal has contended that reference to arbitration was made by this Court in the Special Leave Petition which is pending.	Arguments of Respondent
There was no impediment to mention the said fact before this Court and seeking appropriate direction against Shri Rohatgi if the appellant had any doubt about the neutrality of the said arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Sibal has submitted that the other arbitrator Sri Lodha had also appeared for the appellant State of Rajasthan as an Advocate during the subsistence of arbitration proceeding when he was acting as an arbitrator and such fact may be convincingly demonstrated by referring to the reported decisions of this Court namely 19892SCR152 and AIR1988SC1451 .	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Sibal has submitted that senior counsel appearing for a client owe a duty to the institution and they do not identify with the interests of the client in matters in which they are not appearing.	Arguments of Respondent
Senior Advocates appearing for one litigant appear against him in other matters.	Arguments of Respondent
Such appearance is neither illegal nor improper.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Sibal has submitted that the appellant and the respondent had never doubted about the impartiality and integrity of the said arbitrators who are men of unimpeachable character and precisely for the said reasons, there was no occasion on the apart of the appellant to raise any objection against the functioning of Shri Rohatgi as an arbitrator and the said plea of Shri Rohatgis disability in the aforesaid facts as sought to be raised, is an after thought and made in despair.	Arguments of Respondent
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, it is quite evident that the appellant was aware of Shri Rohatgis appearance as a counsel for the respondent in an appeal before this Court but despite such knowledge, appellant did not raise any objection either before the arbitrators or before this Court during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings but the appellant chose to make various submissions from time to time before the arbitrators and invited adjudication on the reference to arbitration.	Reasoning
In this connection, reference may be made to a decision of this Court in Neelakantan Bros.	Reasoning
Construction v. Superintending Engineer National Highways, Salem and Ors. reported in AIR1988SC2045 , In that case the arbitrator, a senior engineer entered upon the reference and proceeded for some time but in view of his transfer he could not complete the same and successor of his office had taken up the arbitration case from the stage wherefrom the said arbitrator entering upon the reference had left and the said successor in office thereafter gave the award in question.	Reasoning
Questioning the validity of the award it was contended that as the former arbitrator had entered upon the reference and statements of the parties were filed before him and witnesses were also examined before him, the successor engineer has no jurisdiction to proceed with the arbitration matter from the stage left by the arbitrator.	Reasoning
Such challenge to the invalidity of the award was, however, not accepted by this Court by holding that as the fact of taking over the arbitration proceedings by the successor engineer was known to the parties and no objection was raised about his continuing with the arbitration proceedings, the parties had acquiesced to the functioning of the said successor engineer.	Reasoning
Accordingly, a party who had acquiesced to the arbitration by the successor engineer was precluded from objecting to such arbitration and giving award or the reference.	Reasoning
Referring to the Comments on Russel on Arbitration 18 Edition 105, it has been pointed out in the said decision that attending and taking part in proceedings with full knowledge of the relevant fact will amount to acquiescence.	Reasoning
This Court has also referred to an old decision of the Judicial Committee in Chowdhri Murtaza Hossein v. Mussunat Bibi Bechunnissa reported in 3 I.A. 209.	Reasoning
Reliance was also made to the observations in the decision of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Jupitor Calcutta Insurance Co. Ltd. reported in AIR 1956 Cal 1472 Reference was also made to another decision of this Court in N. Chellappan v. Secretary Kerala Electricity Board reported in 19752SCR811 holding that acquiescence defeat the right of the appellant at a later stage.	Reasoning
Similar view was also expressed in another decision of this Court in Prasun Roy v. Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and Anr. reported in 19873SCR569 .	Reasoning
Similar view has also been expressed in a recent judgment of this Court in Reserve Bank of India v, 5.5.	Reasoning
Investments and Ors. reported in 19923SCR871 .	Reasoning
In the said decision, this Court has negatived the contention that Umpires entering upon the reference was invalid by holding that a party objecting to the Umpires entering upon the reference, had agreed to extend the time to enable the Umpire to make the award.	Reasoning
Having agreed to extend such time, it must be held that such party had waived its objection to the umpires entering upon the reference.	Reasoning
In the instant case, admittedly both the parties agreed to extend the time for finally making the award by the joint arbitrators despite the knowledge that Shri Rohatgi had represented one of the parties in a case before this Court.	Reasoning
No objection to his functioning was either raised before the arbitrators or before this Court in the pending special leave petition but the appellant had taken part in all the sittings before the arbitrators and made oral and written submissions and invited the adjudication on the reference.	Reasoning
It is, therefore, quite evident that even if there was any disability of one of the arbitrators, inspite of the knowledge of such disability, the appellant had participated in the arbitration proceedings, agreed to the extension of time for making the award and invited adjudication on the reference.	Reasoning
Accordingly, the appellant cannot be permitted to raise any objection about the validity of the award on the score of disqualification of one of the arbitrators.	Reasoning
That apart, such objection has not been filed within the period of limitation but the same has been sought to be raised after 270 days of the notice of filing the award before this Court.	Reasoning
therefore, the aforesaid objection as to the validity of the award on account of the alleged disqualification of one of the arbitrators is devoid of any substance and must be rejected.	Reasoning
The challenge to the invalidity of the award on account of various errors and omissions apparent on the face of the record as alleged by the appellant in the written argument for the appellant may be summarised as follows (a) the arbitrators clearly misconstrued clause 8 of the special conditions in the contract and the arbitrator failed to take into account that clause 2 to the special conditions only death with the handing over of the site and that clause 8 only dealt with the measurements prior to start of the work which was to be done on the request of the contractor to enable him to prepare the bill.	Reasoning
(b) the arbitrators misread the statement at page 148 Vol. II relating to the dates of handing over site and the dates of taking of measurements.	None
Several dates mentioned in the award in the respect are contrary to the statements at page 148 Vol. II.	None
(c) the arbitrators have taken the date of handing over of the flank block 23 prior to monsoon of 1976.	Reasoning
Such finding is contrary to the record placed before the arbitrators.	None
(d) the arbitrators misread the statement of Sri Adi Anklesaria, because the arbitrators have only referred to answer to question No. 27, They have failed to consider the notes to question No. 147 wherein the said witness explained that it was not necessary in the case of construction of dam that the entire site should be made available before the work could start.	Reasoning
(e) the arbitrators have again misread the statements of Sri Adi Anklesaria in holding that the progress of the claimant was so fast that the claimant was directed to go slow to avoid flooding of Banswara township.	None
It is contended that the documents on record clearly contradict the finding that the contractor was asked to go slow.	None
(f) the arbitrators failed to take into account the letter dated May 6, 1975, written by the claimant (Ex.R44)	None
wherein the claimant himself expressed difficulty in commencing the work before October 15, 1975 and sought to utilise the said period for the construction of other enabling works.	None
(g) the finding of the arbitrators about the delay in handing over the site to the contractor is wrong.	None
(h) the arbitrators have committed a fundamental error in awarding damages on account of alleged delay in carrying out the measurements prior to the work being started without going into the question whether the claimant suffered any loss on account of any such delay.	Reasoning
In this connection, it is also alleged that the arbitrators have not recorded any finding that the target was ever completed or exceeded by the contractor in any of the working seasons, and in the absence of such evidence and in view of evidence to the contrary, there was no question that the claimant had suffered any loss as a result of any delay in getting the measurement done for being able to start work on the site in his possession.	Reasoning
there is no material on record that the claimant ever sought measurement of particular site but the same was delayed and refused by the appellant.	None
(j) that the finding of the arbitrators that there was a delay on the part of the State in supplying the material is erroneous and contrary to the records and arbitrators have failed to take into account special conditions to which the materials were to be supplied by the States on availability.	None
In the absence of any evidence produced by the claimant that as a result of delay in supplying the materials, the construction work was held up and the claimant had suffered loss, the award of damages on the basis of the finding of about non supply of materials in time, tantamounts to an error apparent on record.	Reasoning
(k) that the actual proof of loss suffered by the claimant is sinequo non for award of damages and in the absence of finding of actual loss suffered by the claimants, the award of damages is patently erroneous.	None
In this connection, it has been urged that the arbitrators have misused the letters of Chief Engineer with regard to shortage of gelatin (Ex.R148).	Reasoning
It is contended that the letter of the engineer was written in the context of future requirement of entire project but the same did not deal with the requirement of the contractor.	Reasoning
(l) the statement with regard to the shortage of cement referred by Shri Anklesaria has also been read out of context.	None
The arbitrators in recording the finding of delay in supplying the cement ignored the plea of the appellant in the written statement and there was not even one incident to show that on account of non availability of cement, the claimants work suffered.	None
(m) the finding of the arbitrator that the claimant was entitled to extension has been assailed by contending that the arbitrators failed to take into account the plea of the appellant raised at page 164 Vol. II of the written submissions that the claimant had failed to apply for extension of time within the stipulated period as per clause 5 and has also failed to give cogent reason for extension.	Reasoning
The award of damages without quantifying the same in accordance with any rational principle has been assailed by contending that in a case of speaking award, the quantification of damages must be based on some principle and cannot be quantified arbitrarily by adopting rule of thumb.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has also been contended that the damages of Rs. 1 crore awarded by the arbitrators are patently excessive and disproportionate to any loss suffered by the claimants.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, it has been alleged that the amount for which the tender was submitted by the claimants was Rs. 6,36,76,741 and average rate for the claim of masonary and concrete work work is Rs. 1.35 per cubic mtr.	Arguments of Petitioner
The quantity payable to the claimant from 197578 is Rs. 1,85,000 cubic mtrs.	Arguments of Petitioner
and at the rate of 1.35 per cubic mtr.	Arguments of Petitioner
amount payable to claimant comes to 2,49,75,000 and the amount actually paid to the claimant in respect of the work done is Rs. 2,73,00,000.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been contended that in fact, the claimant received excessive payment for the total work performed by him.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended that the award of Rs. 1 crore in favour of the claimant when he had also received Rs. 24 lakh in excess of his tender price, is patently unjust.	Arguments of Petitioner
17.	None
Disputing the aforesaid contentions about the invalidity of the award on account of error in fact and in law it has been contended by the respondent that the arbitrators have specifically held that (a) appellant was in breach of its fundamental obligation (b) the appellant repudiated the material provisions of the contract, (c) in para 28 of the Written Statement, the appellant admitted that in the first working season only 59.64 of the site could be progressively handed over.	Arguments of Respondent
(d) for the second working season the site could only be handed over for another 11.89 (e) the appellant State of Rajasthan delayed giving possession of the complete site by three years.	None
It has also been alleged that in coming to such findings the arbitrators have relied upon the record of the proceedings of Mahi Control Board and the contemporaneous reports of the Chief Engineers of the State to the said Board.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrators also relied upon the evidence of Shri Anklesaria, the principal witness produced by the State of Rajasthan.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrators have held that the admissions made by Shri Anklesaria in cross examination, were further evidenced by the report of the Chief Engineers to the Mahi Control Board.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrators have also held that the State should have granted extension of time under the provisions of Clause 5 and in terms of the Force majeure clause of the contract.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrators also held that beside floods, there was shortage of raw materials over which the contractor had not control like the non availability of the stone, sand, short supply of cement, power and gelatin.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrators have also held that the refusal of the State to extend time and the invocation of clauses 2 and 3 resulted in the breach of the contract by the State of Rajasthan.	Arguments of Respondent
Disputing the contention that there was any error in the findings of the arbitrators about the delay in handing over the site and the other fundamental breaches committed by the State, reference has been made to the depositions before the arbitrators of the principal witness of the state of Rajasthan, Shri Anklesaria, by indicating the answers given in respect of question Nos. 235, 236, 237 and also question Nos. 208, 209, 204, 157, 138, 118 and question Nos. 24, 31, 81 and 166.	Arguments of Respondent
In the written submissions filed on behalf of the respondent, such questions and the corresponding answers have been quoted.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also contended that the arbitrators have placed reliance on three separate reports submitted by three separate Chief Engineers to the Mahi Control Boards.	Arguments of Respondent
Such reports were made by Shri Gurucharan Singh, Shri B.K. Mehra and Shri J.I. Gianchandani.	Arguments of Respondent
In the said reports the danger of the flooding of Banswara township was mentioned.	Arguments of Respondent
The delayed handing over of flank blocks was admitted.	Arguments of Respondent
The proposal to take up the work at the risks and costs of the contractor after invoking clauses 2 and 3 of the contract was also indicated.	Arguments of Respondent
The Chief Engineers reported about the critical short supply of cement, power, gelatin, face stone, stone from Aeru Quarry and short supply of sand.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also contended that to avoid financial liability, a proposal to invoke clauses 2 and 3 of the contract was forwarded to the Mahi Control Board and in the said reports there are admissions about the fundamental breaches of obligations of the State of Rajasthan.	Arguments of Respondent
In was decided to cancel the contract without granting any extension of time.	Arguments of Respondent
The report of Shri Gurucharan Singh, Chief Engineer, revealed that the bottlenecks requiring immediate removal were the short supply of cement and dynamite, short availability of stone and sand, short availability efface masonry, inadequate power and settlement of the financial claims of the contractor.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Gianchandani, another Chief Engineer in his report categorically admitted that the contractor gave satisfactory report during the working season 197778.	None
On October 6, 1977, the Chief Engineer in his note to the Mahi Control Board stated as per conditions of contract the rates tendered by them were valid for a period of 5 years and thereafter escalation is to be paid it will be in the interest of the Government to limit the amount of work to be carried out beyond April 1980 to the minimum so that the unascertained liability on the department is reduced to the minimum.	None
It has been urged by the respondent that based upon these reports and other evidences available before the arbitrators, the arbitrators have held consequently, the States exercise of power to terminate the contract was unlawful.	Arguments of Respondent
The States election to take the performance of contract out of the hands of the contractor was unjustified.	Arguments of Respondent
The States action to seize the plant and machinery of the contractor was wholly illegal.	None
It has been contended that the arbitrators have held that the State of Rajasthan did not perform their part of the bargain and the State wrongfully invoked the provisions of clauses 2 and 3, and wrongfully invoked the provisions of clause 2 and 3, and wrongfully denied the claimant extension of time.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrators have held that forfeiture under clause 4 could have only been exercised if the invocation of clause 2 was rightfully made.	Arguments of Respondent
Exercise of power under clause 4 was invalidated as the delay was caused by the State.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrators have held that the remedy for wrongful forfeiture is to award damages as would put the claimant contractor in as nearly as possible the same position as if no such wrong was committed.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been contended by the respondent claimant that since the State was guilty of breach and repudiation of the contract, and had also resiled from its contractual obligations, it was not entitled to claim any liquidated damages from the claimant.	Arguments of Respondent
If the State was even partly responsible for the delay, the State could not invoke clause 2 and 3 and levy liquidated damages.	Arguments of Respondent
In view of an agreed liquidated damage clause, the States claim for unliquidated damage is also not sustainable.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of the contention that coming to an erroneous decision on facts by the arbitrator is not a misconduct and it is also not misconduct if the relevant facts are misunderstood and misappreciated, several decisions have been referred to.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been urged by Mr. Sibal that appraisement of evidence by the arbitrator is ordinarily a matter which the Courts do not question and consider and the Court has no jurisdiction to substitute its own evaluation of the conclusion in law or fact.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been contended that the arbitrators were men of wide judicial experience.	Arguments of Respondent
They had taken pains in referring to various facts in detail in basing their findings in support of the award.	Arguments of Respondent
Both the parties were given adequate opportunities to lead evidences and to make submissions.	Arguments of Respondent
The long award runs over 38 pages containing cogent reasons for basing the various findings in support of the award with reference to materials on record.	Arguments of Respondent
Even if it is held that the arbitrators have failed to appreciate the evidences and material on record in the proper perspective, the findings made by the arbitrators on misunderstanding or misappreciation of the law and fact do not render the award invalid warranting interference by the Court.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been urged by Mr. Sibal that the appellant State of Rajasthan has miserably failed to point out that the arbitrators have referred to any proposition of law which is patently illegal on the face of it.	Arguments of Respondent
There is no material to show that the award is so patently erroneous and perverse that it shocks the judicial conscience of the Court and no reasonable man would have arrived to the conclusions made by the arbitrators on the face of materials on record.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been contended that when a case is referred to arbitration, the award rendered by a judge by the choice of the parties, should be accepted and preserved as far as possible and unless there is gross error apparent on the face of the record or the misconduct of the arbitrator can otherwise be convincingly demonstrated, interference with an award is not called for and the law is well settled in this regard.	Arguments of Respondent
After considering the respective contentions of the parties and submissions made by the learned Counsel of the parties and the award impugned, it appears to us that the arbitrators have not taken into consideration any matter outside the scope of reference.	Reasoning
On the basis of agreement between the parties and in terms of the nomination of the respective arbitrator by the parties, the dispute and differences covered by the written agreement had been referred for arbitration by the said arbitrators.	Reasoning
It is nobodys case that the arbitrators are incompetent to enter upon the reference.	Reasoning
It is also not the case of the either of the parties that any extraneous matter has been taken into consideration by the arbitrators.	Reasoning
There is also no allegation that reasonable opportunity of being heard has not been given to either of the parties by the arbitrators or the arbitrators have considered any document behind the back of any party.	Reasoning
It prima facie appears to us that in basing the findings in the award, the arbitrators have referred to and relied upon the materials on record and it cannot be reasonably contended that there was no basis whatsoever to base the findings made by the arbitrators upon consideration of the materials on record.	Reasoning
In our view, the appellant has failed to demonstrate any finding made by the arbitrator is either fanciful or not referable to be materials on record.	Reasoning
What has been sought to be contended by the appellant is that the arbitrators have failed to properly appreciate various clauses of the agreement between the parties relating to the project of Mahi Bajaj sagar Dam.	Reasoning
The appellant has also contended that the evidence given by Shri Anklesaria has been misappreciated, misunderstood and has been appreciated out of context.	Reasoning
The arbitrators have considered the deposition of Sri Anklesaria and reports of the Chief Engineers out of their context and on misappreciation and misreading of the materials on record, the erroneous findings are arrived at.	Reasoning
The arbitrator is the final arbiter for the dispute between the parties and it is not open to challenge the award on the ground that the arbitrator has drawn his own conclusion or has failed to appreciate the facts.	Reasoning
In Sudarshan Trading Co. v. Government of Kerala and Anr. reported in 19891SCR665 it has been held this Court that there is a distinction between disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be exercised.	Reasoning
There may be a conflict as to the power of the arbitrator to grant a particular remedy.	Reasoning
One has to determine the distinction between an error within the jurisdiction and an error in excess of the jurisdiction.	Reasoning
Court cannot substitute its own evaluation of the conclusion of law or fact to come to the conclusion that the arbitrator had acted contrary to the bargain between the parties.	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied).	Reasoning
Whether a particular amount was liable to be paid is a decision within the competency of the arbitrator.	Reasoning
By purporting to construe the contract the Court cannot taken upon itself the burden of saying that this was contrary to the contract and as such beyond jurisdiction.	Reasoning
If on a view taken of a contract, the decision of the arbitrator on certain amounts awarded is a possible view though perhaps not the only correct view, the award cannot be examined by the Court.	Reasoning
Where the reasons have been given by the arbitrator in making the award the Court cannot examine the reasonableness of the reasons.	Reasoning
If the parties have selected their own forum, the deciding forum must be conceded the power of appraisement of evidence.	Reasoning
The arbitrator is the sole judge of the quality as well as the quantity of evidence and it will be for the court to take upon itself the task of being a judge on the evidence before the arbitrator.	Reasoning
In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. lagan Nath Ashok Kumar and Anr.	None
reported in 1987 SCC (4) 497 it has been held by this Court that appraisement of evidence by the arbitrator is ordinarily never a matter which the Court questions and considers.	None
It may be possible that on the same evidence the Court may arrive at a different conclusion than the one arrived at by the arbitrator but that by itself is no ground for setting aside the award.	None
It has also been held in the said decision that it is difficult to give an exact definition of the word reasonable.	None
Reason varies in its conclusions according to the idiosyncrasies of the individual and the time and circumstances in which he thinks.	None
In cases not covered by authority, the verdict of a jury or the decision of a judge sitting as a jury usually determines what is reasonable in each particular case.	None
The word reasonable has in law prima facie meaning of reasonable in regard to those circumstances of which the actor, called on to act reasonably knows or ought to know.	None
An arbitrator acting as a judge has to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system and subordinated to the primordial necessity of order in the social life.	None
therefore, where reasons germane and relevant for the arbitrator to hold in the manner he did, have been indicated, it cannot be said that the reasons are unreasonable.	None
In this case, claims before the arbitrators arise from the contract between the parties.	None
It is well settled that if a question of law is referred to arbitrator and the arbitrator comes to a conclusion, it is not open to challenge the award on the ground that an alternative view of law is possible.	None
In this connection, reference may be made to the decisions of this Court in Alopi Prasad v. Union of India reported in 1960 2 SCR 799 and Kapoor Nilokheri Cooperative Diary Farm Society reported in 1973 1 SCC 78	None
In Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Indian Carbon Ltd. reported in 19883SCR426 , this Court has held that the Court does not sit in appeal over the award and review the reasons.	None
The Court can set aside the award only if it is apparent from the award that there is no evidence to support the conclusions or if the award is based upon any legal proposition which is erroneous.	None
It may also be mentioned here in that it is not necessary to indicate in the award computation made for various heads and it is open to the arbitrator to give a lumpsum award.	Reasoning
In this connection, reference may be made to the decisions made in State of Rajasthan v. R.S. Sharma and Co. reported in (1988)4SCC353 and in State of Orissa and Ors.	Reasoning
v. Lall Brothers reported in AIR1988SC2018 and in Firm Madanlal Roshanlal Mahajan v.	Reasoning
Hukumchand Mills Ltd.	Reasoning
Indore reported in 19671SCR105 In the State of Orissa v. Lall Brothers (supra) it has been held that an award is conclusive as a judgment between the parties and the court is entitled to set aside an award only if the arbitrator has misconducted himself in the proceedings or when the award has been made after the issue of an order by the Court superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have become invalid under Section 35 of the Arbitration Act or where an award has been improperly procured or is otherwise invalid under Section 30 of the Act.	Reasoning
An award may be set aside by the Court on the ground of error on the fact of award, but an award is not invalid merely because by a process of inference and argument, it may be demonstrated that the arbitrator has committed some mistake in arriving at his conclusion (emphasis supplied).	Reasoning
A court of competent jurisdiction has both right and duty to decide the lis presented before it for adjudication according to the best understanding of law and facts involved in the lis by the judge presiding over the court.	None
Such decision even if erroneous either in factual determination or application of law correctly, is a valid one and being inter parties.	None
It does not, therefore, stand to reason that the arbitrators award will be per se invalid and inoperative for the simple reason that the arbitrator has failed to appreciate the facts and has committed error in appreciating correct legal principle in basing the award.	None
An erroneous decision of a court of law is open to judicial review by way of appeal or revision on accordance with the provisions of law.	None
Similarly, an award rendered by an arbitrator is open to challenge within the parameters of several provisions of the Arbitration Act.	None
Since the arbitrator is a judge by choice of the parties, and more often than not, a person with little or no legal background, the adjudication of disputes by an arbitration by way of an award can be challenged only within the limited scope of several provisions of the Arbitration Act and the legislature in its wisdom has limited the scope and ambit of challenge to an award in the Arbitration Act.	None
Over the decades, judicial decisions have Indicated the parameters of such challenge consistent with the provisions of the Arbitration Act.	None
By and large the courts have disfavoured interference with arbitration award on account of error of law and fact on the score of misappreciation and misreading of the material on record and have shown definite inclination to preserve the award as far as possible.	Arguments of Respondent
As reference to arbitration of disputes in commercial and other transactions involving substantial amount has increased in recent times, the courts were impelled to have fresh look on the ambit of challenge to an award by the arbitrator of the award does not get undesirable immunity.	None
In recent times, error in law and fact in basing an award has not given the wide immunity as enjoyed earlier, by expanding the import and implication of legal misconduct of an arbitrator so that award by the arbitrator does not perpetrate gross miscarriage of justice and the same is not reduced to mockery of a fair decisions of the lis between the parties to arbitration.	None
Precisely for the aforesaid reasons, the erroneous application of law constituting the very basis of the award and improper and incorrect findings of fact, which without closer and intrinsic scrutiny, are demonstrable on the face of the materials on record, have been held, very rightly, as legal misconduct rendering the award as invalid.	Facts
It is necessary, however, to put a not of caution that in the anxiety to render justice to the party to arbitration, the court should not reappraise the evidence intrinsically with a close scrutiny for finding out that the conclusion drawn from some facts, by the arbitrator is, according to the understanding of the court, erroneous.	None
Such exercise of power which can be exercised by an appellate court with power to reverse the finding of fact, is alien to scope and ambit of challenge of an award under the Arbitration Act.	None
Where the error of finding of facts having a bearing on the award is patent and is easily demonstrable without the necessity of carefully weighing the various possible view points, the interference with award based on erroneous finding of fact is permissible.	None
Similarly, if an award is based by applying a principle of law which is patently erroneous and but for such erroneous application of legal principle, the award could have been made, such award is liable to be aside by holding that there has been legal misconduct on the part of the arbitrator.	None
In ultimate analysis, it is a question of delicate balancing between the permissible limit of error of law and fact and patently erroneous finding easily demonstrable from the materials on record and application of principle of law forming the basis of the award which is patently erroneous.	None
It may be indicated here that however objectively the problem may be viewed, the subjective element inherent in the judge deciding the problem, is bound to creep in and influence the decision.	None
By long training in the art of dispassionate analysis, such subjective element is, however, reduced to minimum.	None
Keeping the aforesaid principle in mind, the challenge to the validity of the impugned award is to be considered with reference to judicial decisions on the subject.	None
The contentions about factual errors and omissions apparent on the face of record as raised in the written argument are essentially errors and omissions in not properly considering the materials on record, in misreading and misconstruing such materials and consideration of some documents and statements out of their contexts.	Reasoning
The arbitrators have given the award by referring to various documents and statements available on record and indicating the reasons for basing the findings.	Reasoning
Even if it is assumed that on the materials on record, a different view could have been taken and the arbitrators have failed to consider the document and materials on record in their proper perspective, the award is not liable to be struck down in view of judicial decisions referred to hereinbefore.	Reasoning
Error apparent on the face of the record does not mean that on closer scrutiny of the import of documents and material on record, the finding made by the arbitrator may be held to be erroneous.	Reasoning
Judicial decisions over the decades have indicated that an error of law or fact committed by an arbitrator by itself does not constitute misconduct warranting interference with the award.	Reasoning
It does not appear to us that the findings made by the arbitrators are without any basis whatsoever and are not referable to documents relied upon and such findings are so patently unjust or perverse that no reasonable man could have arrived to such findings.	Reasoning
Hence, on the score of alleged misreading, misconstruction, misappreciation of the materials on record or failure to consider some of the materials in their proper perspective, the impugned award is not liable to be set aside.	Reasoning
It has been urged that computation of lump sum damage in the absence of any material showing actual loss suffered by the contractor is patently unjust and improper warranting interference by this Court.	Reasoning
Lump sum award by itself is not illegal as held a number of decisions of this Court.	Reasoning
The contractors case was that because of delay in handing over the site and for non supply or delayed supply of materials essential for the construction work thereby putting obstacles and hindrances to execute the work within the stipulated time and ultimately repudiating the contract and seizing machineries etc. of the contractors, he not only suffered huge loss but was practically reduced to bankruptcy.	Reasoning
It is the case of the contractor that on account of illegal seizure of costly machineries by the appellant, he was prevented from undertaking other works of contract, A part of machineries seized by the appellant have been sold for Rs. 20 lakhs.	Reasoning
In the award, the arbitrators have recorded that the appellant admitted that the remaining machineries would cost about Rs. 5 lakhs.	Reasoning
That apart, constructions of labour quarters, laying of roads etc. at substantial cost incurred by the contractor have been utilised by the appellant after repudiation of contact.	Reasoning
It may be stated here that the first part of construct work of Mahi Bajaj Sagar Dam was given to M s. R.S. Sharma.	Reasoning
A lump sum award of Rs. 75,41,755 was awarded in favour of M s. R.S. Sharma.	Reasoning
The machineries of M s. Sharma were not seized by the appellant.	Reasoning
Such lump sum award of more than Rs. 75 lakhs without indicating how such quantum was determined has been upheld by this Court and the decision is reported in State of Rajasthan v. R.S. Sharma Co.	Reasoning
(supra).	Reasoning
The respondent contractor has urged that the machineries including those seized and sold at depreciated value will now cost about 2.5 crores of rupees.	Reasoning
Considering the magnitude of work involving costly machineries and materials, if the two arbitrators in their wide experience have quantified the total damage and has given the award for Rs. 1 crore in favour of the respondent, it cannot be held that such award is so patently unjust and irrational and shocking to the conscience of the court, that the same should be interfered with.	Reasoning
As already indicated, in the case of other contractor concerning first part of the work in Mahi Bajaj Sagar Dam, namely, R.S. Sharma Co.	Reasoning
the arbitrators quantified damages to the extent of over Rs. 75 lakhs without indicating how such damages had been quantified.	Reasoning
But challenge to such award by the State of Rajasthan failed and the award has been upheld by this Court.	Reasoning
We, therefore, dismiss the petition of objection and additional objection challenging the validity of the award.	Decision
We are now left with the claim of further interest besides the interest awarded by the arbitrators in favour of the respondent on the said sum of Rs. 1 crore 15 per annum from September 30, 1986 till the date of payment of decree whichever is earlier.	Reasoning
The respondent Contractor in its application under Sections 15, 17, 20 and 29 of the Arbitration Act filed in the said Special leave petition (Civil) No. 9089 of 1984 has prayed for modification of the award of interest.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been contended by the respondent contractor that the arbitrators had jurisdiction to award interest from 24.2.1979 when the subject matter of dispute was pending arbitration.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been contended that in the Constitution Bench Judgment of this Court in the case of Secretary, Irrigation Department v. G.C. Roy reported in 19913SCR417 , the decision made in AbhaData Jena, reported in 19881SCR253 was overruled.	Arguments of Respondent
The Constitution Bench stated with approval the passage in the 4th Edition Vol. 2 para 534 in Halsburys Laws of England where it is stated that the arbitrator must decide the dispute in accordance with the ordinary law.	None
The Constitution Bench has also held in the said decisions that a person deprived of the use of money to which he is legitimately entitled has a right to be compensated for the deprivation, call it by any name.	None
It may be called interest, compensation or damages.	None
This basic consideration is as valid for the period the dispute is pending before the arbitrator as it is for the period prior to the arbitrator entering upon the reference.	None
This is the principle of Section 34, civil Procedure Code and there is no reason or principle to hold otherwise in the case of arbitrator.	None
an arbitrator is an alternative forum for resolution of disputes arising between the parties.	None
If so, he must have the power to decided all the disputes for differences arising between the parties.	None
If the arbitrator has no power to award interest pendente lite, the party claiming it would have to approach the court for that purpose, even though he may have obtained satisfaction in respect of other claims from the arbitrator.	None
This would lead to multiplicity of proceedings.	None
an arbitrator is the creature of an agreement.	None
It is open to the parties to confer upon him such powers and prescribe such procedure for him to follow as they think fit so long as they are not opposed to law.	None
All the same, the agreement must be in conformity with law.	None
The arbitrator must also act and make his award in accordance with the general law of the land and the agreement.	None
The Constitution Bench has pointed out that over the years, the English and Indian Courts have acted on the assumption that where the agreement does not prohibit and a party to the reference makes a claim for interest, the arbitrator must have the power to award interest pendente lite and until Jena case, almost all the courts in the country had upheld the power of the arbitrator to award interest pendente lite.	Reasoning
It has also been indicated in the said Constitution Bench decision that the interest pendente lite is not a matter of substantive law, like interest for the period anterior to reference (prereference period).	Reasoning
For doing complete justice between the parties, such power has always been inferred.	Reasoning
In the case of Santosh Singh Arora v. Union of India reported in AIR1992SC1809 , relying on the said Constitution Bench decision in G.C. Roys case, this Court held that the appellant in the said case was entitled to be compensated for denial of his legitimate dues.	Reasoning
This Court has allowed interest from December 18, 1968 when the arbitrator was named and not from November 21, 1983 when the matter was referred to the arbitration of Shri Justice A.C. Gupta.	Reasoning
The respondent has claimed that interest be awarded from February 24, 1979 or from May 30, 1979 that is the date of the breach and the award should be modified and decreed on that basis by allowing interest 18 per annum.	Reasoning
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we are, however, not inclined to award any interest from February 24, 1979 or from May 30, 1979 and the prayer for enhancement of the rate of interest at 18 is also not allowed.	Decision
Since the total damages suffered by the respondent has been quantified by the arbitrator in the award at Rs. 1 crore without indicating different heads for the computation of the said sum, it should be presumed that the arbitrators had taken into consideration all relevant facts in assessing the actual loss suffered upto the date of award.	Decision
The appellant State of Rajasthan will be allowed to withdraw a sum of Rs. 25 lakhs or Rs. 26 lakhs that has been realised from the sale of the respondents assets under the order of this Court and as set out in the award, after the State of Rajasthan satisfies the award which is made a rule of Court.	Decision
The prayer for cost of Rs. 10 lakhs in addition to the amounts under the award to be paid to the respondent is also rejected.	Decision
The bank guarantee, if any, furnished by the respondent under the order of this Court made in Special leave petition (civil) No. 9089 of 1984 stands discharged in favour of the respondent.	Decision
The application is accordingly disposed of without any order as to costs.	Decision
No further order need be passed on the pending application.	Decision
The Interim Application therefore stands disposed of.	Decision
