 F. Nariman, J. The present appeals arise from a judgment of the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity dated 7th April, 2016.	Issue
The facts necessary to appreciate the issues which arise in the present case, which will cover all the cases before us, will be taken only from Civil Appeal No.5348 of 2016, namely Prayas (Energy) Group v. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.	Issue
Section 63 of the Electricity Act, 2003 provides for procurement of power and determination of tariff by a transparent competitive bidding process.	Facts
Once this is done, the appropriate Commission is to adopt the tariff which is accepted in the competitive bid subject to guidelines that are made by the Central Government.	Facts
On 19th January, 2005, the Central Government issued detailed guidelines under this provision, which were amended from time to time.	Facts
On 1st February, 2006, Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) issued a public notice inviting proposals for supply of power on long term basis under three different competitive bid processes.	Facts
The participating bidders were to decide on the tariff and quote such tariff after competing against each other.	Facts
The bidders were entitled to quote escalable or nonescalable tariff or partly escalable and partly nonescalable tariff, as was considered appropriate by them to cover their respective risks so as to obtain whatever returns are available to them.	Facts
The best levelised tariff as per certain predisclosed criteria was to be followed in order to arrive at the lowest tender.	Facts
Haryana Utilities also initiated a separate competitive bidding process for purchase of 2000 MW on a long term basis.	Facts
This was done on 25th May, 2006.	Facts
The participating bidders were also entitled to quote bids on the lines of the GUVNL public notice.	Facts
Both the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission and the Haryana State Regulatory Commission approved the bid documents and the process proposed by GUVNL and the Haryana Utilities, after which Requests for Proposal were issued by both of them.	Facts
On 2nd/4th January, 2007, Adani Enterprises Consortium submitted its bid for generation and supply of 1000 MW to GUVNL, quoting a levelised tariff of Rs. 2.3495/kWh (Rs.1/kWh as the capacity charge and Rs. 1.3495/kWh as nonescalable energy charge).	Facts
In the bid, the Consortium indicated that the lead member, Adani Enterprises, had an arrangement for indigenous coal requirement of the project with Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation, as the said Corporation had been allotted a certain coal block in the State of Chhattisgarh.	Facts
Also, a Memorandum of Understanding was entered into between Adani Enterprises Ltd. and a German Company for supply of noncoking coal of 3 to 5 million tons (imported coal) on a long term basis till the year 2032.	Facts
A similar Memorandum of Understanding was also entered into between Adani Enterprises and a Japanese agent for supply of 3 to 5 million tons of coal again on a long term basis.	Facts
The two Memoranda of Understanding were attached to the bid submitted by Adani Enterprises.	Facts
On 11th January, 2007, the Adani Enterprises Consortium was selected by GUVNL as the successful bidder for supply of 1000 MW of power and a Letter of Intent was issued in its favour.	Facts
On 2nd February, 2007, a Power Purchase Agreement was entered into between GUVNL and Adani Power and this was for supply of power from a power project being set up at Korba in Chhattisgarh.	Facts
This was changed to a Mundra Project in Gujarat.	Facts
On 18th April, 2007, a supplementary PPA was signed to this effect.	Facts
As far as Haryana is concerned, Adani Power submitted their bid for supply of 1425 MW of power to Haryana Utilities on 24th November, 2007.	Facts
This was at a levelised tariff of Rs. 2.94/kWh from the Mundra Power Project.	Facts
The energy charges quoted were nonescalable.	Facts
Adani Power was declared as the successful bidder in Haryana for supply of 1424 MW contracted capacity on 17th July, 2008 and a Letter of Intent was issued.	Facts
Two separate PPAs were executed by Adani Power with two Haryana entities for supply of 712 MW of power to each of them from the Mundra Power Project.	Facts
The Haryana State Commission adopted the tariff under Section 63 of the Electricity Act on 31st July, 2008 (The Gujarat State Commission had adopted the tariff under Section 63 for supply of power to GUVNL on 20th December, 2007).	Facts
An important part of the case on behalf of the respondents is that a change in law in Indonesia took place in 2010 and 2011, which aligned the export price of coal from Indonesia to international market prices instead of the price that was prevalent for the last 40 years.	Facts
This being the case, in both the cases, Adani Power filed a petition before the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission being Petition No.155 of 2012 on 5th July, 2012 under Section 79 of the Electricity Act seeking relief on the score of the impact of the Indonesian Regulation to either discharge them from the performance of the PPA on account of frustration, or to evolve a mechanism to restore the petitioners to the same economic condition prior to occurrence of the change in law.	Facts
On 16th October, 2012, the Central Commission held that the Power Purchase Agreements entered into by Adani in both the cases constituted a composite scheme for generation and sale of electricity as envisaged under Section 79(1)(b) of the Electricity Act.	Facts
This being so, it held that it was the appropriate Commission under the Act and not the respective State Commissions, which had jurisdiction in the matter.	Facts
A review petition against this order was dismissed on 16th January, 2013.	Facts
On 2nd April, 2013, the Central Commission passed an order, whereby the claim of Adani Power on the grounds of force majeure and or change in law was held not to be admissible.	Facts
However, the Commission held that in exercise of the regulatory powers provided under Section 79 of the Act, the Central Commission can provide redressal of grievances to generating companies, considering the larger public interest, and hence constituted a committee to look into the alleged difficulties faced by Adani and to find an acceptable solution thereto.	Facts
On 16th August, 2013, pursuant to the order dated 2nd April, 2013, the Committee constituted by the Commission submitted a report.	Facts
Based on the Committees report, on 21st February, 2014, the Central Commission proceeded to grant compensatory tariff.	Facts
Appeals and crossappeals were filed against this order, including cross objections.	Facts
On 1st August, 2014, crossobjection filed by Adani Power was rejected by the Appellate Tribunal as not maintainable.	Facts
On 31st October, 2014, the Appellate Tribunal rejected the prayer for condonation of delay and consequently Appeal No. 10016 of 2014 was filed by Adani Power.	Facts
Against this order, Adani Power filed an appeal before the Supreme Court, and this Court, in its order dated 31st March, 2015 held the Appellant (Adani Power) is entitled to argue any proposition of law, be it force majeure or change in law in support of the order dated 21.2.2014 quantifying the compensatory tariff, the correctness of which is under challenge before the Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No.98 of 2014 and Appeal No.116 of 2014 preferred by the respondents, so long as such argument is based on the facts which are already pleaded before the Central Commission.	Facts
Finally, the Appellate Tribunal on 7th April, 2016, passed the impugned judgment in all the aforesaid cases before us.	Facts
The Tribunal held, agreeing with the Commission, that generation and sale of power by Adani Power to GUVNL and Haryana Utilities was a composite scheme within the meaning of Section 79(1) (b) of the Act and that, therefore, the Central Commission would have jurisdiction to proceed further in the matter.	Facts
The Appellate Tribunal considered the Supreme Court order dated 31st March, 2015 and felt that the argument of force majeure and change in law could be gone into by it.	Facts
It ultimately concluded, having regard to the law on frustration contained in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the relevant provisions of the PPAs, that force majeure was made out on the facts of these cases and reversed the Commission on this score.	Facts
It also reversed the Commission on exercise of regulatory powers under Section 79, stating that these powers could not be exercised once there was a PPA entered into under Section 63 of the Act.	Facts
It also held that change in law provisions do not apply to foreign law and, therefore, changes in Indonesian law did not come within the scope of the provisions.	Facts
Insofar as changes in Indian law were concerned, it held that the Government Policies that were relied upon, do not constitute law.	Facts
Accordingly, the matter was remanded to the Commission to find out the impact of the force majeure event to grant compensatory tariff.	Facts
The Commission by its order dated 6.12.2016 has arrived at a certain determination as to compensatory tariff to be granted on account of force majeure.	Facts
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.	None
On behalf of the appellants Senior Counsel Shri Ramachandran, and Shri Prashant Bhushan have argued that the liberty given to Adani Power by the order dated 31st March, 2015 of this Court was only limited to support the quantification of compensatory tariff granted by the Central Commission by its order dated 21st February, 2014.	Arguments of Petitioner
Hence, Adani Power is not entitled to raise the issue of force majeure and change in law as a substantive issue, the force majeure claim and the change in law claim having been rejected by the Central Commission in its earlier order and there being no valid appeal against the said order, force majeure and change in law cannot be gone into.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further argued, in the alternative, that in any case, force majeure either under Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 or under clauses 12.3 and 7 of the respective PPAs make it clear that it must be an unforeseen event or circumstance that wholly or partly prevents the affected party in the performance of its obligations under the agreement.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to learned counsel, Adani voluntarily decided to quote energy charges as nonescalable in order to be competitive and, therefore, get the award of the contract.	Arguments of Petitioner
It cannot now, in the guise of being affected by force majeure, convert this into an escalable tariff.	Arguments of Petitioner
They have further argued that the bid given by Adani Enterprises was not premised on the import of coal from Indonesia only and this being the case it was open to them to get coal from any source.	Arguments of Petitioner
The price of coal is the price of raw material and if prices go up, a contract does not get frustrated merely because it becomes commercially onerous, as the PPA itself states in clause 12.4.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any event, the fundamental basis of the PPAs between the parties was not premised on the price of coal imported from Indonesia.	Arguments of Petitioner
11.	Arguments of Petitioner
On a true construction of the Act, learned counsel argued in support of the Tribunal judgment that Section 63 of the Electricity Act is a standalone provision and is notwithstanding anything contained in Section 62.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is obvious that under Section 62 read with Section 61 and 64, the Commission has to determine tariff under the Act having regard to various factors, whereas under Section 63 of the Act, the Commission does not determine but only adopts tariff obtained through a transparent process of competitive bidding.	Arguments of Petitioner
This being the case, it is clear that there is no residuary source of power contained in the Commission either in Section 79 or otherwise to fix compensatory tariffs once the tariff is adopted under Section 63.	Arguments of Petitioner
If at all, such tariff can be modified only in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government and not otherwise.	Arguments of Petitioner
They also argued that the Central Commission itself has no jurisdiction in view of the fact that on facts there is no composite scheme for the reason that the generation and sale of electricity from the power project of Adani, under independent PPAs to Gujarat and Haryana Utilities, with different tariffs, and from different generating units selected under different competitive bidding processes, would show that there is no one composite scheme containing uniform tariffs.	Arguments of Petitioner
This being the case, the State Commissions alone would have jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further argued that there is no change in law, either for the very good reason stated by the Commission, viz.	Arguments of Petitioner
that change in law applies to Indian and not Indonesian law, and further, a change in the tariff policy in India will also not constitute change in law.	Arguments of Petitioner
They, therefore, supported the Tribunal judgment on this aspect.	Arguments of Petitioner
12. Learned Senior counsel Shri Kapil Sibal, Shri Harish Salve, Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan, on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, countered each one of these submissions.	Arguments of Respondent
According to learned counsel, first and foremost the Central Commission alone would have jurisdiction on the facts of these cases, inasmuch as Sections 79 and 86 form part of one scheme.	Arguments of Respondent
It was argued by them that all cases fall within either Section 79 or Section 86.	Arguments of Respondent
It is clear that under Section 86, the State Commissions have only to deal with generation and sale of electricity within the State.	Arguments of Respondent
When generation and sale takes place outside the State, as is the case here, the State Commission would have no jurisdiction under Section 86, and consequently Section 79(1) (b) has to be read as part of a scheme in which the moment generation and sale of electricity is interState and not intra State, the Central Commission alone would have jurisdiction.	Arguments of Respondent
Judged in this light, the expression composite scheme would only mean that generation and sale of electricity would be in more than one State.	Arguments of Respondent
For this they also relied on the definition of composite scheme in the 2016 Central Government Policy.	Arguments of Respondent
They further argued that the scheme of the Act shows that neither 61 nor Section 79 are done away with when Section 63 applies.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 63 does not use the expression notwithstanding anything contained in this Act.	Arguments of Respondent
It is clear, therefore, that all these Sections have to be harmoniously construed.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 79 is without a doubt a repository of power to fix tariffs and or modify fixation even when Section 63 applies.	Arguments of Respondent
Indeed, Shri Sibal argued that if there were no guidelines or if a matter arose de hors the guidelines, then obviously there cannot be a gap in the law which remains unfilled.	Arguments of Respondent
The residuary power of the Commission necessarily comes in under Section 79.	Arguments of Respondent
In any event, they also argued that the guidelines, as amended, that are issued by the Central Government under Section 63 clearly take care of the present situation in that any change in law that occurs and any dispute which relates to tariffs can both be resolved before the Central Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
They also countered the submissions on force majeure by stating that the fundamental basis of the contract was the fuel supply agreement that was to be entered into, and pointed out various clauses in the PPAs to show that the fuel supply agreement and imported coal were both very important elements, both in the bid and the PPAs.	Arguments of Respondent
Nonescalable tariffs do not lead to the conclusion that if a source of coal becomes unavailable in a manner that completely undermines the basis of the bid, the tariff cannot be adjusted.	Arguments of Respondent
If otherwise they fall within the change in law provision and or force majeure provision, the mere fact that a nonescalable tariff has been quoted would make no difference.	Arguments of Respondent
A large part of the argument was centered around the meaning of the expression frustration in the Contract Act and the correct construction of clause 12 of the PPA.	Arguments of Respondent
A large number of authorities, both English and Indian, were cited to show that the contract had become commercially impracticable, and that they would have to fold up operations, which would not be in public interest as the consumers would then have to obtain electricity at rates much higher than were quoted by them.	Arguments of Respondent
According to them, a force majeure event in Clause 12 takes place the moment performance is hindered and there can be no doubt that an astronomical rise in prices of Indonesian coal, thanks to a change in law, has certainly hindered performance.	Arguments of Respondent
They also argued that in any event the change in law clause is very wide and since the PPA deals with imported coal, obviously change in law would cover foreign law.	Arguments of Respondent
They also went on to add that when the PPA wanted to restrict a particular clause to Indian law, it did so expressly.	Arguments of Respondent
They also stated that it is significant that neither GUVNL nor Haryana Utilities had filed appeals in the present case, and the Government had in several policy decisions and statements made it clear that in cases like the present, where there is grave unforeseen hardship on account of nonallocation of Indian coal, the rise in cost should be adequately compensated.	Arguments of Respondent
They, therefore, questioned the locus standi of the consumer groups, who are the only appellants before us, stating that on the estimation made by the respondents, the impact of increase in both cases on tariff would be extremely minimal as opposed to the huge accumulated losses suffered by these entities which would make them fold up.	Arguments of Respondent
Ultimately, it was argued that even the Central Commission did not give them the entire benefit of rise in price in coal, and consequently in the final analysis the relief granted on the ground of force majeure by the Central Commission should not be disturbed, and relief on the ground of change in law should, in addition, have been given to them.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of the Union of India, submitted before us that he was not interested in the ultimate outcome of the appeals before us.	Arguments of Petitioner
He was only appearing in order to apprise us that the electricity sector, having been privatized, has largely fulfilled the object sought to be achieved by the 2003 Act, which is that electricity generation, being delicenced, should result in production of far greater electricity than was earlier produced.	Arguments of Petitioner
He urged us not to disturb the delicate balance sought to achieved by the Act i.e. that producers or generators of electricity, in order that they set up power plants, be entitled to a reasonable margin of profit and a reasonable return on their capital, so that they are induced to set up more and more power plants.	Arguments of Petitioner
This must be consistent with competitiveness among them, which then translates itself into reasonable tariffs that are payable by consumers of electricity.	Arguments of Petitioner
For this purpose, he relied strongly upon Section 3 of the Electricity Act, which states that the Central Government, shall from time to time, prepare a National Electricity Policy and a tariff policy in consultation with the State Governments, and the authority for development of the power system, based on optimal utilization of natural resources.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, the National Electricity Policy and tariff policy that are issued from time to time, being statutory in nature, are binding on all concerned.	Arguments of Petitioner
This is, in fact, further recognized by Section 61(i) by which the appropriate Commission, in specifying terms and conditions for determination of tariffs, shall be guided by the National Electricity Policy and tariff policy.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Central Governments role can further be seen even in Section 63, where guidelines that are binding on all are issued by the Central Government in cases where there is a transparent process of bidding.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, according to him, Section 79(4) also points in the same direction, stating that, in discharge of its functions, the Central Commission shall be guided by the National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan, and tariff policy published under Section 3.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also referred us to the Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs recognizing the overall shortfall in manufacture of domestic coal and the new coal distribution policy issued in July, 2013 pursuant to the Cabinet Committee which, according to him, are in the nature of binding directions making it clear that as generators of electricity, who depend upon indigenous coal, have been given less coal than was anticipated, should be allowed either to import the coal themselves, or purchase imported coal from Coal India Ltd., with the difference in price being passed through to them.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further referred to and relied upon the revised tariff policy of 28th January, 2016 for the same purpose.	Arguments of Petitioner
Relevant provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 The 2003 Act did away with three earlier statutes in which a completely different regime for generating and supply of electricity was provided for, namely, the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1928 and the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998.	None
The Statement of Objects of Reasons for this Act reads as follows The Electricity Supply Industry in India is presently governed by three enactments namely, the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998.	None
1.1	None
The Indian Electricity Act, 1910 created the basic framework for electric supply industry in India which was then in its infancy.	None
The Act envisaged growth of the electricity industry through private licensees.	None
Accordingly, it provided for licensees who could supply electricity in a specified area.	None
It created the legal framework for laying down of wires and other works relating to the supply of electricity.	None
1.2	None
The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 mandated the creation of a State Electricity Board.	None
The State Electricity Board has the responsibility of arranging the supply of electricity in the State.	None
It was felt that electrification which was limited to cities needed to be extended rapidly and the State should step in to shoulder this responsibility through the State Electricity Boards.	None
Accordingly the State Electricity Boards through the successive Five Year Plans undertook rapid growth expansion by utilizing Plan funds.	None
1.3	None
Over a period of time, however, the performance of SEBs has deteriorated substantially on account of various factors.	None
For instance, though power to fix tariffs vests with the State Electricity Boards, they have generally been unable to take decisions on tariffs in a professional and independent manner and tariff determination in practice has been done by the State Governments.	None
Crosssubsidies have reached unsustainable levels.	None
To address this issue and to provide for distancing of government from determination of tariffs, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, was enacted in 1998.	None
It created the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and has an enabling provision through which the State Governments can create a State Electricity Regulatory Commission.	None
16 States have so far notified created State Electricity Regulatory Commissions either under the Central Act or under their own Reform Acts.	None
2.	None
Starting with Orissa, some State Governments have been undertaking reforms through their own Reform Acts.	None
These reforms have involved unbundling of the State Electricity Boards into separate Generation, Transmission and Distribution Companies through transfer schemes for the transfer of the assets and staff into successor Companies.	None
Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have passed their Reform Acts and unbundled their State Electricity Boards into separate companies.	None
Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have also enacted their Reforms Acts which, inter alia, envisage unbundling corporatisation of SEBs.	None
3.	None
With the policy of encouraging private sector participation in generation, transmission and distribution and the objective of distancing the regulatory responsibilities from the Government to the Regulatory Commissions, the need for harmonizing and rationalizing the provisions in the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998 in a new selfcontained comprehensive legislation arose.	None
Accordingly, it became necessary to enact a new legislation for regulating the electricity supply industry in the country which would replace the existing laws, preserve its core features other than those relating to the mandatory existence of the State Electricity Board and the responsibilities of the State Government and the State Electricity Board with respect to regulating licensees.	None
There is also need to provide for newer concepts like power trading and open access.	None
There is also need to obviate the requirement of each State Government to pass its own Reforms Act.	None
The Bill has progressive features and endeavours to strike the right balance given the current realities of the power sector in India.	None
It gives the State enough flexibility to develop their power sector in the manner they consider appropriate.	None
The Electricity Bill, 2001 has been finalized after extensive discussions and consultations with the States and all other stake holders and experts.	None
4.	None
The main features of the Bill are as follows (i) Generation is being delicensed and captive generation is being freely permitted.	None
Hydro projects would, however, need approval of the State Government and clearance from the Central Electricity Authority which would go into the issues of dam safety and optimal utilization of water resources.	None
(ii) There would be a Transmission Utility at the Central as well as State level, which would be a Government company and have the responsibility of ensuring that the transmission network is developed in a planned and coordinated manner to meet the requirements of the sector.	None
The load dispatch function could be kept with the Transmission Utility or separated.	None
In the case of separation the load dispatch function would have to remain with a State Government organization company.	None
(iii) There is provision for private transmission licensees.	None
(iv) There would be open access in transmission from the outset with provision for surcharge for taking care of current level of cross subsidy with the surcharge being gradually phased out.	None
(v) Distribution licensees would be free to undertake generation and generating companies would be free to take up distribution licensees.	None
(vi) The State Electricity Regulatory Commissions may permit open access in distribution in phases with surcharge for  (a) current level of cross subsidy to be gradually phased out along with cross subsidies and (b) obligation to supply.	None
(vii) For rural and remote areas stand alone systems for generation and distribution would be permitted.	None
(viii) For rural areas decentralized management of distribution through Panchayats, Users Associations, Cooperatives or Franchisees would be permitted.	None
(ix) Trading as a distinct activity is being recognized with the safeguard of the Regulatory Commissions being authorized to fix ceilings on trading margins, if necessary.	None
(x) Where there is direct commercial relationship between a consumer and a generating company or a trader the price of power would not be regulated and only the transmission and wheeling charges with surcharge would be regulated.	None
(xi) There is provision for a transfer scheme by which company companies can be created by the State Governments from the State Electricity Boards.	None
The State Governments have the option of continuing with the State Electricity Boards which under the new scheme of things would be a distribution licensee and the State Transmission Utility which would also be owning generation assets.	None
The service conditions of the employees would as a result of restructuring not be inferior.	None
(xii)	None
An Appellate Tribunal has been created for disposal of appeals against the decision of the CERC and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions so that there is speedy disposal of such matters.	None
The State Electricity Regulatory Commission is a mandatory requirement.	None
(xiii)	None
Provisions relating to theft of electricity have a revenue focus.	None
5.	None
The Bill seeks to replace the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 and the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act, 1998.	None
6.	None
The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.	None
In the present case, we are concerned with the following Sections Section 3.	None
National Electricity Policy and Plan.  	None

Functions of State Commission.	None
(1) The State Commission shall discharge the following functions, namely,  (a) determine the tariff for generation, supply, transmission and wheeling of electricity, wholesale, bulk or retail, as the case may be, within the State Provided that where open access has been permitted to a category of consumers under Section 42, the State Commission shall determine only the wheeling charges and surcharge thereon, if any, for the said category of consumers (b) regulate electricity purchase and procurement process of distribution licensees including the price at which electricity shall be procured from the generating companies or licensees or from other sources through agreements for purchase of power for distribution and supply within the State (c) facilitate intrastate transmission and wheeling of electricity (d) issue licences to persons seeking to act as transmission licensees, distribution licensees and electricity traders with respect to their operations within the State (e) promote cogeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy by providing suitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase of electricity from such sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution licensee (f) adjudicate upon the disputes between the licensees, and generating companies and to refer any dispute for arbitration (g) levy fee for the purposes of this Act (h) specify State Grid Code consistent with the Grid Code specified under clause (h) of subsection (1) of section 79 (i) specify or enforce standards with respect to quality, continuity and reliability of service by licensees (j) fix the trading margin in the intraState trading of electricity, if considered, necessary (k) discharge such other functions as may be assigned to it under this Act.	None
The construction of Section 63, when read with the other provisions of this Act, is what comes up for decision in the present appeals.	None
It may be noticed that Section 63 begins with a nonobstante clause, but it is a nonobstante clause covering only Section 62.	None
Secondly, unlike Section 62 read with Sections 61 and 64, the appropriate Commission does not determine tariff but only adopts tariff already determined under Section 63.	None
Thirdly, such adoption is only if such tariff has been determined through a transparent process of bidding, and, fourthly, this transparent process of bidding must be in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.	None
What has been argued before us is that Section 63 is a stand alone provision and has to be construed on its own terms, and that, therefore, in the case of transparent bidding nothing can be looked at except the bid itself which must accord with guidelines issued by the Central Government.	None
One thing is immediately clear, that the appropriate Commission does not act as a mere post office under Section 63.	None
It must adopt the tariff which has been determined through a transparent process of bidding, but this can only be done in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Government.	None
Guidelines have been issued under this Section on 19th January, 2005, which guidelines have been amended from time to time.	None
Clause 4, in particular, deals with tariff and the appropriate Commission certainly has the jurisdiction to look into whether the tariff determined through the process of bidding accords with clause 4.	None
It is important to note that the regulatory powers of the Central Commission, so far as tariff is concerned, are specifically mentioned in Section 79(1).	None
This regulatory power is a general one, and it is very difficult to state that when the Commission adopts tariff under Section 63, it functions de hors its general regulatory power under Section 79(1)(b).	None
For one thing, such regulation takes place under the Central Governments guidelines.	None
For another, in a situation where there are no guidelines or in a situation which is not covered by the guidelines, can it be said that the Commissions power to regulate tariff is completely done away with?	None
According to us, this is not a correct way of reading the aforesaid statutory provisions.	None
The first rule of statutory interpretation is that the statute must be read as a whole.	None
As a concomitant of that rule, it is also clear that all the discordant notes struck by the various Sections must be harmonized.	None
Considering the fact that the nonobstante clause advisedly restricts itself to Section 62, we see no good reason to put Section 79 out of the way altogether.	None
The reason why Section 62 alone has been put out of the way is that determination of tariff can take place in one of two ways  either under Section 62, where the Commission itself determines the tariff in accordance with the provisions of the Act, (after laying down the terms and conditions for determination of tariff mentioned in Section 61) or under Section 63 where the Commission adopts tariff that is already determined by a transparent process of bidding.	Arguments of Petitioner
In either case, the general regulatory power of the Commission under Section 79(1)(b) is the source of the power to regulate, which includes the power to determine or adopt tariff.	None
In fact, Sections 62 and 63 deal with determination of tariff, which is part of regulating tariff.	None
Whereas determining tariff for interState transmission of electricity is dealt with by Section 79(1)(d), Section 79(1)(b) is a wider source of power to regulate tariff.	None
It is clear that in a situation where the guidelines issued by the Central Government under Section 63 cover the situation, the Central Commission is bound by those guidelines and must exercise its regulatory functions, albeit under Section 79(1)(b), only in accordance with those guidelines.	None
As has been stated above, it is only in a situation where there are no guidelines framed at all or where the guidelines do not deal with a given situation that the Commissions general regulatory powers under Section 79(1)(b) can then be used.	None
Jurisdiction of the Central Commission The appellants have argued before us that the expression composite scheme mentioned in Section 79(1) must necessarily be a scheme in which there is uniformity of tariff under a PPA where there is generation and sale of electricity in more than one State.	Reasoning
It is not enough that generation and sale of electricity in more than one State be the subject matter of one or more PPAs, but that something more is necessary, namely, that there must be a composite scheme for the same.	Arguments of Petitioner
In order to appreciate and deal with this submission, it is necessary to set out Section 2(5) of the Act which defines appropriate Government as follows Definitions.	None
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (5) Appropriate Government means,  (a) the Central Government,  (i) in respect of a generating company wholly or partly owned by it (ii) in relation to any interState generation, transmission, trading or supply of electricity and with respect to any mines, oilfields, railways, national highways, airports, telegraphs, broadcasting stations and any works of defence, dockyard, nuclear power installations (iii) in respect of the National Load Despatch Centre and Regional Load Despatch Centre (iv) in relation to any works or electric installation belonging to it or under its control (b) in any other case, the State Government, having jurisdiction under this Act Sections 25 and 30 also have some bearing and are set out as under InterState, regional and interregional transmission.	None
For the purposes of this Part, the Central Government may, make regionwise demarcation of the country, and, from time to time, make such modifications therein as it may consider necessary for the efficient, economical and integrated transmission and supply of electricity, and in particular to facilitate voluntary interconnections and coordination of facilities for the interState, regional and interregional generation and transmission of electricity.	None
30.	None
Transmission within a State.	None
The State Commission shall facilitate and promote transmission, wheeling and interconnection arrangements within its territorial jurisdiction for the transmission and supply of electricity by economical and efficient utilisation of the electricity.	None
The scheme that emerges from these Sections is that whenever there is interState generation or supply of electricity, it is the Central Government that is involved, and whenever there is intraState generation or supply of electricity, the State Government or the State Commission is involved.	Reasoning
This is the precise scheme of the entire Act, including Sections 79 and 86.	Reasoning
It will be seen that Section 79(1) itself in subsections (c), (d) and (e) speaks of interState transmission and interState operations.	None
This is to be contrasted with Section 86 which deals with functions of the State Commission which uses the expression within the State in subclauses (a), (b), and (d), and intrastate in subclause (c).	Reasoning
This being the case, it is clear that the PPA, which deals with generation and supply of electricity, will either have to be governed by the State Commission or the Central Commission.	Reasoning
The State Commissions jurisdiction is only where generation and supply takes place within the State.	Reasoning
On the other hand, the moment generation and sale takes place in more than one State, the Central Commission becomes the appropriate Commission under the Act.	Reasoning
What is important to remember is that if we were to accept the argument on behalf of the appellant, and we were to hold in the Adani case that there is no composite scheme for generation and sale, as argued by the appellant, it would be clear that neither Commission would have jurisdiction, something which would lead to absurdity.	Reasoning
Since generation and sale of electricity is in more than one State obviously Section 86 does not get attracted.	Reasoning
This being the case, we are constrained to observe that the expression composite scheme does not mean anything more than a scheme for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State.	Reasoning
This also follows from the dictionary meaning (McGrawHill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms (6th Edition), and P.Ramanatha Aiyars Advanced Law Lexicon (3rd Edition) of the expression composite Composite  A rerecording consisting of at least two elements.	None
A material that results when two or more materials, each having its own, usually different characteristics, are combined, giving useful properties for specific applications.	None
Also known as composite material.	None
(b)	None
Composite character  A character that is produced by two or more characters one on top of the other.	None
(c) Composite unit  A unit made of diverse elements.	None
The aforesaid dictionary definitions lead to the conclusion that the expression composite only means consisting of at least two elements.	None
In the context of the present case, generation and sale being in more than one State, this could be referred to as composite.	None
Even otherwise, the expression used in Section 79(1)(b) is that generating companies must enter into or otherwise have a composite scheme.	None
This makes it clear that the expression composite scheme does not have some special meaning  it is enough that generating companies have, in any manner, a scheme for generation and sale of electricity which must be in more than one State.	Reasoning
We must also hasten to add that the appellants argument that there must be commonality and uniformity in tariff for a composite scheme does not follow from the Section.	Reasoning
Another important facet of dealing with this argument is that the tariff policy dated 6th June, 2006 is the statutory policy which is enunciated under Section 3 of the Electricity Act.	None
The amendment of 28th January, 2016 throws considerable light on the expression composite scheme, which has been defined for the first time as follows 5.11 (j) Composite Scheme Subsection (b) of Section 79(1) of the Act provides that Central Commission shall regulate the tariff of generating company, if such generating company enters into or otherwise have a composite scheme for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State.	None
Explanation The composite scheme as specified under section 791) of the Act shall mean a scheme by a generating company for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State, having signed longterm or mediumterm PPA prior to the date of commercial operation of the project (the COD of the last unit of the project will be deemed to be the date of commercial operation of the project) for sale of at least 10 of the capacity of the project to a distribution licensee outside the State in which such project is located.	None
That this definition is an important aid to the construction of Section 79(1)(b) cannot be doubted and, according to us, correctly brings out the meaning of this expression as meaning nothing more than a scheme by a generating company for generation and sale of electricity in more than one State.	Reasoning
Section 64(5) has been relied upon by the Appellant as an indicator that the State Commission has jurisdiction even in cases where tariff for interState supply is involved.	Reasoning
This provision begins with a nonobstante clause which would indicate that in all cases involving interState supply, transmission, or wheeling of electricity, the Central Commission alone has jurisdiction.	Reasoning
In fact this further supports the case of the Respondents.	Reasoning
Section 64(5) can only apply if, the jurisdiction otherwise being with the Central Commission alone, by application of the parties concerned, jurisdiction is to be given to the State Commission having jurisdiction in respect of the licensee who intends to distribute and make payment for electricity.	Reasoning
We, therefore, hold that the Central Commission had the necessary jurisdiction to embark upon the issues raised in the present cases.	None
Force Majeure A large part of the argument turned on the finding of the Appellate Tribunal that the rise in price of coal consequent to change in Indonesian law would be a force majeure event which would entitle the respondents to claim compensatory tariff.	None
Before embarking on the merits of this claim, we must first advert to the argument of the appellant that force majeure can only be argued for a very restricted purpose, as has been pointed out in the Supreme Court judgment dated 31st March, 2015.	None
In order to appreciate this contention, it is first necessary to set out the relevant portion of this judgment.	None
By the judgment dated 31st March, 2015, this Court held By order dated 182014, the Appellate Tribunal dismissed the crossobjections of the appellant herein as not maintainable.	None
On 1692014, the appellant preferred Appeal No. DFR No. 2355 of 2014 before the Appellate Tribunal against that part of the order dated 242013 which went against the appellant.	None
Obviously, there was a delay in preferring that appeal.	None
Therefore, the appellant filed an application bearing IA No. 380 of 2014 seeking condonation of delay in preferring the appeal which was rejected by the impugned order.	None
Hence, the instant appeal.	None
14.	Arguments of Petitioner
The issue before this Court is limited.	None
It is the correctness of the decision of the Appellate Tribunal in declining to condone the delay in preferring the appeal against the order dated 242013 of the Central Commission.	None
15.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, elaborate submissions were made regarding the scope of Order 41 Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (for short CPC), and its applicability to an appeal under Section 111 of the Act by the appellant relying upon earlier decisions of this Court.	None
The respondents submitted that such an enquiry is wholly uncalled for as the crossobjections of the appellant in Appeal No. 100 of 2013 stood rejected and became final.	None
16.	None
Lastly, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that even if this Court comes to the conclusion that the appellant has not made out a case for condonation of delay in preferring an appeal against the order dated 242013 of the Central Commission, the appellant is entitled to argue in the pending Appeals Nos. 98 and 116 of 2014 both the grounds of force majeure and change of law not for the purpose of seeking the relief of a declaration of the frustration of the contracts between the appellants and the respondents, thereby relieving the appellant of his obligations arising out of the contracts, but only for the purpose of seeking the alternative relief of compensatory tariff.	None
In other words, the appellants submission is that the facts which formed the basis of the submission of the frustration of contracts are also relevant for supporting the conclusion of the National Commission that the appellant is entitled for the relief of compensatory tariff.	None
17.	None
We agree with the respondents that we are not required to go into the question of the applicability of Order 41 Rule 22 in the instant appeal as the decision of the Appellate Tribunal to reject the crossobjections of the appellant by its order dated 182014 has become final and no appeal against the said order is pending before us.	None
18.	None
We are also not required to go into the question whether the order of the Central Commission dated 242013 by which it declined to grant a declaration of frustration of the contracts either on the ground of force majeure or on the ground of change of law is independently appealable, since no such appeal even if maintainable, is preferred by the appellant.	None
19.	None
The question whether the appellant made out a case for condonation of delay in preferring the appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, in our opinion, need not also be examined by us in view of the last submission made by the appellant.	None
If the appellant is not desirous of seeking a declaration that the appellant is relieved of the obligation to perform the contracts in question, the correctness of the decision of the Appellate Tribunal in rejecting the application to condone the delay in preferring the appeal would become purely academic.	None
We are of the opinion that so long as the appellant does not seek a declaration, such as the one mentioned above, the appellant is entitled to argue any proposition of law, be it force majeure or change of law in support of the order dated 2122014 quantifying the compensatory tariff, the correctness of which is under challenge before the Appellate Tribunal in Appeal No. 98 of 2014 and Appeal No. 116 of 2014 preferred by the respondents, so long as such an argument is based on the facts which are already pleaded before the Central Commission.	Reasoning
This Court dealt with an appeal arising out of an order of the Appellate Tribunal dated 31st October, 2014, in which the Appellate Tribunal declined to condone a delay of 481 days in preferring an appeal against an order dated 2nd April, 2013.	None
As has been stated by this Court, the issue before the Court was limited.	None
This Court held that the appellant is entitled to argue force majeure and change in law in pending Appeals Nos.98 and 116 of 2014.	None
This was because what was concluded by the Central Commission was force majeure and change of law for the purpose of seeking the relief of declaration of frustration of the contract between the appellant and the respondents, thereby relieving the appellant of its obligations arising out of the contract.	None
Since the appellant was not desirous of seeking a declaration that the appellant is relieved of the obligation of performing the contract in question, the appellant is entitled to argue force majeure or change of law in support of the Commissions order of 21st February, 2014, which quantified compensatory tariff, the correctness of which is under challenge in Appeal Nos.98 and 116 of 2014.	Reasoning
This being the case, it is clear that this Court did not give any truncated right to argue force majeure or change of law.	Reasoning
This Court explicitly stated that both force majeure and change of law can be argued in all its plenitude to support an order quantifying compensatory tariff so long as the appellants do not claim that they are relieved of performance of the PPAs altogether.	Reasoning
This being the case, we are of the view that the preliminary submission of the appellant before us is without any force.	Reasoning
Accordingly, the Appellate Tribunal rightly went into force majeure and change of law.	Reasoning
Force majeure is governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872.	Reasoning
In so far as it is relatable to an express or implied clause in a contract, such as the PPAs before us, it is governed by Chapter III dealing with the contingent contracts, and more particularly, Section 32 thereof.	Reasoning
In so far as a force majeure event occurs de hors the contract, it is dealt with by a rule of positive law under Section 56 of the Contract.	Reasoning
Sections 32 and 56 are set out herein Enforcement of Contracts contingent on an event happening Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event happens, cannot be enforced by law unless and until that event has happened.	None
If the event becomes impossible, such contracts become void.	None
56.	None
Agreement to do impossible act An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void.	None
Contract to do act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawful.	None
A contract to do an act which, after the contract made, becomes impossible or, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.	None
Compensation for loss through nonperformance of act known to be impossible or unlawful.	None
Where one person has promised to do something which he knew or, with reasonable diligence, might have known, and which the promisee did not know, to be impossible or unlawful, such promisor must make compensation to such promise for any loss which such promisee sustains through the nonperformance of the promise.	None
Prior to the decision in Taylor v. Caldwell, (186173)	None
All ER Rep 24, the law in England was extremely rigid.	None
A contract had to be performed, notwithstanding the fact that it had become impossible of performance, owing to some unforeseen event, after it was made, which was not the fault of either of the parties to the contract.	None
This rigidity of the common law in which the absolute sanctity of contract was upheld was loosened somewhat by the decision in Taylor v. Caldwell in which it was held that if some unforeseen event occurs during the performance of a contract which makes it impossible of performance, in the sense that the fundamental basis of the contract goes, it need not be further performed, as insisting upon such performance would be unjust.	None
The law in India has been laid down in the seminal decision of Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur Co., 1954	None
SCR 310.	None
The second paragraph of Section 56 has been adverted to, and it was stated that this is exhaustive of the law as it stands in India.	None
What was held was that the word impossible has not been used in the Section in the sense of physical or literal impossibility.	None
The performance of an act may not be literally impossible but it may be impracticable and useless from the point of view of the object and purpose of the parties.	None
If an untoward event or change of circumstance totally upsets the very foundation upon which the parties entered their agreement, it can be said that the promisor finds it impossible to do the act which he had promised to do.	None
It was further held that where the Court finds that the contract itself either impliedly or expressly contains a term, according to which performance would stand discharged under certain circumstances, the dissolution of the contract would take place under the terms of the contract itself and such cases would be dealt with under Section 32 of the Act.	None
If, however, frustration is to take place de hors the contract, it will be governed by Section 56.	None
In M s Alopi Parshad Sons Ltd. v. Union of India, 1960 (2) SCR 793 , this Court, after setting out Section 56 of the Contract Act, held that the Act does not enable a party to a contract to ignore the express covenants thereof and to claim payment of consideration, for performance of the contract at rates different from the stipulated rates, on a vague plea of equity.	None
Parties to an executable contract are often faced, in the course of carrying it out, with a turn of events which they did not at all anticipate, for example, a wholly abnormal rise or fall in prices which is an unexpected obstacle to execution.	None
This does not in itself get rid of the bargain they have made.	None
It is only when a consideration of the terms of the contract, in the light of the circumstances existing when it was made, showed that they never agreed to be bound in a fundamentally different situation which had unexpectedly emerged, that the contract ceases to bind.	None
It was further held that the performance of a contract is never discharged merely because it may become onerous to one of the parties.	None
Similarly, in Naihati Jute Mills Ltd. v. Hyaliram Jagannath, 1968 (1) SCR 821 , this Court went into the English law on frustration in some detail, and then cited the celebrated judgment of Satyabrata Ghose v.	None
Mugneeram Bangur Co.	None
Ultimately, this Court concluded that a contract is not frustrated merely because the circumstances in which it was made are altered.	None
The Courts have no general power to absolve a party from the performance of its part of the contract merely because its performance has become onerous on account of an unforeseen turn of events.	None
It has also been held that applying the doctrine of frustration must always be within narrow limits.	None
In an instructive English judgment namely, Tsakiroglou Co. Ltd. v. Noblee Thorl GmbH, 1961 (2) All ER 179, despite the closure of the Suez canal, and despite the fact that the customary route for shipping the goods was only through the Suez canal, it was held that the contract of sale of groundnuts in that case was not frustrated, even though it would have to be performed by an alternative mode of performance which was much more expensive, namely, that the ship would now have to go around the Cape of Good Hope, which is three times the distance from Hamburg to Port Sudan.	None
The freight for such journey was also double.	None
Despite this, the House of Lords held that even though the contract had become more onerous to perform, it was not fundamentally altered.	None
Where performance is otherwise possible, it is clear that a mere rise in freight price would not allow one of the parties to say that the contract was discharged by impossibility of performance.	None
This view of the law has been echoed in Chitty on Contracts, 31st edition.	None
In paragraph 14151 a rise in cost or expense has been stated not to frustrate a contract.	None
Similarly, in Treitel on Frustration and Force Majeure, 3rd edition, the learned author has opined, at paragraph 12034, that the cases provide many illustrations of the principle that a force majeure clause will not normally be construed to apply where the contract provides for an alternative mode of performance.	None
It is clear that a more onerous method of performance by itself would not amount to an frustrating event.	None
The same learned author also states that a mere rise in price rendering the contract more expensive to perform does not constitute frustration.	None
(See paragraph 15158)	None
Indeed, in England, in the celebrated Sea Angel case, 2013 (1) Lloyds Law Report 569, the modern approach to frustration is well put, and the same reads as under In my judgment, the application of the doctrine of frustration requires a multifactorial approach.	None
Among the factors which have to be considered are the terms of the contract itself, its matrix or context, the parties knowledge, expectations, assumptions and contemplations, in particular as to risk, as at the time of the contract, at any rate so far as these can be ascribed mutually and objectively, and then the nature of the supervening event, and the parties reasonable and objectively ascertainable calculations as to the possibilities of future performance in the new circumstances.	None
Since the subject matter of the doctrine of frustration is contract, and contracts are about the allocation of risk, and since the allocation and assumption of risk is not simply a matter of express or implied provision but may also depend on less easily defined matters such as the contemplation of the parties, the application of the doctrine can often be a difficult one.	None
In such circumstances, the test of radically different is important it tells us that the doctrine is not to be lightly invoked that mere incidence of expense or delay or onerousness is not sufficient and that there has to be as it were a break in identity between the contract as provided for and contemplated and its performance in the new circumstances.	None
It is clear from the above that the doctrine of frustration cannot apply to these cases as the fundamental basis of the PPAs remains unaltered.	Reasoning
Nowhere do the PPAs state that coal is to be procured only from Indonesia at a particular price.	Reasoning
In fact, it is clear on a reading of the PPA as a whole that the price payable for the supply of coal is entirely for the person who sets up the power plant to bear.	Reasoning
The fact that the fuel supply agreement has to be appended to the PPA is only to indicate that the raw material for the working of the plant is there and is in order.	Reasoning
It is clear that an unexpected rise in the price of coal will not absolve the generating companies from performing their part of the contract for the very good reason that when they submitted their bids, this was a risk they knowingly took.	Reasoning
We are of the view that the mere fact that the bid may be nonescalable does not mean that the respondents are precluded from raising the plea of frustration, if otherwise it is available in law and can be pleaded by them.	Reasoning
But the fact that a nonescalable tariff has been paid for, for example, in the Adani case, is a factor which may be taken into account only to show that the risk of supplying electricity at the tariff indicated was upon the generating company.	Reasoning
Coming to the PPAs themselves, we find that the force majeure clause contained in all of them is in a standard form and is as follows 12.3 Force Majeure Force Majeure means any event or circumstance or combination of events and circumstances including those stated below that wholly or partly prevents or unavoidably delays an Affected Party in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, but only if and to the extent that such events or circumstances are not within the reasonable control, directly or indirectly, of the Affected Party and could not have been avoided if the Affected Party had taken reasonable care or complied with Prudent Utility Practices i. Natural Force Majeure Events act of God, including, but not limited to lightning, drought, fire and explosion (to the extent originating from a source external to the Site), earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, food, cyclone, typhoon, tornado, or exceptionally adverse weather conditions which are in excess of the statistical measures for the last hundred (100) years, ii.	None
NonNatural Force Majeure Events 1 Direct NonNatural Force Majeure Events a Nationalization or compulsory acquisition by any Indian Government Instrumentality or any material assets or rights of the Seller or the Sellers contractors or b The unlawful, unreasonable or discriminatory revocation of, or refusal to renew, any Consent required by the Seller or any of the Sellers contractors to perform their obligations under the Project Documents or any unlawful, unreasonable or discriminatory refusal to grant any other consent required for the development operation of the Project, provided that an appropriate court of law declares the revocation or refusal to be unlawful, unreasonable and discriminatory and strikes the same down or c Any other unlawful, unreasonable or discriminatory action on the part of an Indian Government Instrumentality which is directed against the Project, provided that an appropriate court of law declares the revocation or refusal to be unlawful, unreasonable and discriminatory and strikes the same down.	None
2 Indirect Non  Natural Force Majeure Events a Any act of war (whether declared or undeclared), invasion, armed conflict or act of foreign enemy, blockade, embargo, revolution, riot, insurrection, terrorist or military action or b Radio active contamination or ionising radiation originating from a source in India or resulting from another Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event excluding circumstances where the source or cause of contamination or radiation is brought or has been brought into or near the site by the affected party or those employed or engaged by the affected party or c Industry wide strikes and labor disturbances having a nationwide impact in India.	None
12.7 Available Relief for a Force Majeure Event Subject to this Article 12 a No Party shall be in breach of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the extent that the performance of its obligations was prevented, hindered or delayed due to a Force Majeure Event b	None
Every Party shall be entitled to claim relief in relation to a Force Majeure Event in regard to its obligations, including but not limited to those specified under Article 4.5.	None
c	None
For the avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that no Tariff shall be paid by the Procurers for the part of Contracted Capacity affected by a Natural Force Majeure Event affecting the Seller, for the duration of such Natural Force Majeure Event.	None
For the balance part of the Contracted Capacity, the Procurer shall pay the Tariff to the Seller, provided during such period of Natural Force Majeure Event, the balance part of the Power Station is declared to be Available for scheduling and dispatch as per ABT for supply of power by the Seller to the Procurers.	None
d	None
If the average Availability of the Power Station is reduced below sixty (60) percent for over two (2) consecutive months or for any non consecutive period of four (4) months both within any continuous period of sixty (60) months, as a result of an Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure, then, with effect from the end of that period and for so long as the daily average Availability of the Power Station continues to be reduced below sixty (60) percent as a result of an Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure of any kind, the Procurers shall make payments for Debt Service, relatable to such Unit, which are due under the Financing Agreements, subject to a maximum of Capacity Charges based on Normative Availability, and these amounts shall be paid from the date, being the later of a) the date of cessation of such Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event and b) the completion of sixty (60) days from the receipt of the Financing Agreements by the Procurer(s) from the Seller, in the form of an increase in Capacity Charge.	None
Provided such Capacity Charge increase shall be determined by CERC on the basis of putting the Seller in the same economic position as the Seller would have been in case the Seller had been paid Debt Service in a situation when the Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure had not occurred.	None
Provided that the Procurers will have the above obligation to make payment for the Debt Service only (a) after the Unit(s) affected by such Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event has been Commissioned, and (b) only if in the absence of such Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event, the Availability of such Commissioned Unit(s) would have resulted in Capacity Charges equal to Debt Services.

If the average Availability of the Power Station is reduced below eighty (80) percent for over two (2) consecutive months or for any non consecutive period of four (4) months both within any continuous period of sixty (60) months, as a result of a Direct Non Natural Force Majeure, then, with effect from the end of that period and for so long as the daily average Availability of the Power Station continues to be reduced below eighty (80) percent as a result of a Direct Non Natural Force Majeure of any kind, the Seller may elect in a written notice to the Procurers, to deem the Availability of the Power Station to be eighty (80) percentage from the end of such period, regardless of its actual Available Capacity.	None
In such a case, the Procurers shall be liable to make payment to the Seller of Capacity Charges calculated on such deemed Normative Availability, after the cessation of the effects of Non Natural Direct Force Majeure in the form of an increase in Capacity Charge.	None
Provided such Capacity Charge increase shall be determined by CERC on the basis of putting the Seller in the same economic position as the Seller would have been in case the Seller had been paid Capacity Charges in a situation where the Direct Non Natural Force Majeure had not occurred.	None
f	None
For so long as the Seller is claiming relief due to any Non Natural Force Majeure Event (or Natural Force Majeure Event affecting the Procurer s) under this Agreement, the Procurers may from time to time on one (1) days notice inspect the Project and the Seller shall provide Procurers personnel with access to the Project to carry out such inspections, subject to the Procurers personnel complying with all reasonable safety precautions and standards.	None
Provided further the Procurers shall be entitled at all times to request Repeat Performance Test, as per Article 8.1, of the Unit(s)	None
Commissioned earlier and now affected by Direct or Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event (or Natural Force Majeure event affecting the Procurer s), where such Testing is possible to be undertaken in spite of the Direct or Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event (or Natural Force Majeure Event affecting the Procurer s), and the Independent Engineer accepts and issues a Final Test Certificate certifying such Unit(s) being capable of delivering the Contracted Capacity and being Available, had there been no such Direct or Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event (or Natural Force Majeure Event affecting the Procurer s).	None
In case, the Available Capacity as established by the said Repeat Performance Test (provided that such Repeat Performance Test, the limitation imposed by Article 8.1.1 shall not apply) and Final Test Certificate issued by the Independent Engineer is less than the Available Capacity corresponding to which the Seller would have been paid Capacity Charges equal to Debt Service in case of Indirect Non Natural Force Majeure Event (or Natural Force Majeure Event affecting the Procurer s), then the Procurers shall make prorata payment of Debt Service but only with respect to such reduced Availability.	None
For the avoidance of doubt, if Debt Service would have been payable at an Availability of 60 and pursuant to a Repeat Performance Test it is established that the Availability would have been 40, then Procurers shall make payment equal to Debt Service multiplied by 40 and divided by 60.	None
Similarly, the payments in case of Direct Non Natural Force Majeure Event (and Natural Force Majeure Event affecting the Procurer s) shall also be adjusted prorata for reduction in Available Capacity.	None
(g)	None
In case of a Natural Force Majeure Event affecting the Procurer s which adversely affects the performance obligations of the Seller under this Agreement, the provisions of subproviso (d) and (f) shall apply.	None
(h) For the avoidance of doubt, it is specified that the charges payable under this Article 12 shall be paid by the Procurers in proportion to their then existing Allocated Contracted Capacity.	None
It has strongly been contended by counsel for the respondents that, first and foremost, the force majeure clause is not exhaustive, but is only inclusive.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it may wholly or partly prevent an affected party from performance of obligations under the agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
Rise in the price of Indonesian coal, according to them, was unforeseen inasmuch as the PPAs have been entered into sometime in 2006 to 2008, and the rise in price took place only in 2010 and 2011.	Arguments of Respondent
Such rise in price is also not within their control at all and, therefore, clause 12.3 read with clause 12.7 would apply.	Arguments of Respondent
They further argued that the force majeure clause in the present case went further and stated that so long as performance of their obligation was hindered due to a force majeure event, they can claim compensatory tariff.	Arguments of Respondent
First and foremost, the respondents are correct in stating that the force majeure clause does not exhaust the possibility of unforeseen events occurring outside natural and or nonnatural events.	Reasoning
But the thrust of their argument was really that so long as their performance is hindered by an unforeseen event, the clause applies.	Reasoning
Chitty on Contracts, 31st edition at para 14151 cites a number of judgments for the proposition that the expression hindered must be construed with regard to words which precede and follow it, and also with regard to the nature and general terms of the contract.	None
Given the fact that the PPA must be read as a whole, and that clauses 12.3 and 12.7(a) are a part of the same scheme of force majeure under the contract, it is clear that the expression hindered in clause 12.7(a) really goes with the expression partly prevents in clause 12.3.	None
Force majeure clauses are to be narrowly construed, and obviously the expression prevents in clause 12.3 is spoken of also in clause 12.7(a).	None
When prevent is preceded by the expression wholly or partly, it is reasonable to assume that the expression prevented in clause 12.7(a) goes with the expression wholly in clause 12.3 and the expression hindered in clause 12.7(a) goes with the expression partly.	None
This being so, it is clear that there must be something which partly prevents the performance of the obligation under the agreement.	None
Also, Treitel on Frustration and Force Majeure, 3rd edition, in paragraph 15158 cites the English judgment of Tennants (Lancashire) Ltd. v. G.S. Wilson and Co. Ltd., 1917 Appeal Cases 495 for the proposition that a mere rise in price rendering the contract more expensive to perform will not constitute hindrance.	None
This is echoed in the celebrated judgment of Peter Dixon Sons Ltd. v. Henderson, Craig Co. Ltd., 1919(2) KB 778 in which it was held that the expression hinders the delivery in a contract would only be attracted if there was not merely a question of rise in price, but a serious hindrance in performance of the contract as a whole.	None
At the beginning of the First World War, British ships were no longer available, and although foreign shipping could be obtained at an increased freight, such foreign ships were liable to be captured by the enemy and destroyed through mines or submarines, and could be detained by British or allied warships.	None
In the circumstances, the Tennants (Lancashire) Ltd. judgment was applied, and the Court of Appeals held Under the circumstances, can it be said that the sellers were not hindered or prevented within the meaning of the contract?	None
It is not a question of price, merely an increase of freight.	None
Tonnage had to be obtained to bring the pulp in Scandinavian ships, and although the difficulty in obtaining tonnage may be reflected in the increase of freight, it was not a mere matter of increase of freight if so, there were standing contracts that ought to have been fulfilled.	None
Counsel for the respondents urged that certain shipowners, for reasons of their own, chose not to fulfil standing contracts.	None
It was not only shipowners but pulp buyers and sellers.	None
The whole trade was dislocated, by reason of the difficulty that had arisen in tonnage.	None
It seems to me that the language of Lord Dunedin in Tennants, Ld. v. Wilson Co. is applicable to the present case Where I think, with deference to the learned judges, the majority of the Court below have gone wrong is that they have seemingly assumed that price was the only drawback.	None
I do not think that price as price has anything to do with it.	None
Price may be evidence, but it is only one of many kinds of evidence as to shortage.	None
If the appellants had alleged nothing but advanced price they would have failed.	None
But they have shown much more.	None
That is exactly so here.	None
Price, as price only, would not have affected it.	None
They were all standing contracts, but the position has so changed by reason of the war that buyers and sellers and the whole trade were hindered or prevented from carrying out those contracts.	None
As a matter of fact, clause 12.4 of the PPA, which deals with force majeure exclusions, reads as follows 12.4 Force Majeure Exclusions Force Majeure shall not include (i) any event or circumstance which is within the reasonable control of the parties and (ii) the following conditions, except to the extent that they are consequences of an event of Force Majeure a. Unavailability, late delivery, or changes in cost of the plant, machinery, equipment, materials, spare parts, fuel or consumables for the Project b. Delay in the performance of any contractor, subcontractors or their agents excluding the conditions as mentioned in Article 12.2 c. Nonperformance resulting from normal wear and tear typically experienced in power generation materials and equipment d. Strikes or labour disturbance at the facilities of the Affected Party e. Insufficiency of finances or funds or the agreement becoming onerous to perform and f. Nonperformance caused by, or connected with, the Affected Partys i. Negligent or intentional acts, errors or omissions ii.	None
Failure to comply with an Indian Law or iii.	None
Breach of, or default under this Agreement or any Project Documents.	None
This clause makes it clear that changes in the cost of fuel, or the agreement becoming onerous to perform, are not treated as force majeure events under the PPA itself.	None
We are, therefore, of the view that neither was the fundamental basis of the contract dislodged nor was any frustrating event, except for a rise in the price of coal, excluded by clause 12.4, pointed out.	Reasoning
Alternative modes of performance were available, albeit at a higher price.	Reasoning
This does not lead to the contract, as a whole, being frustrated.	Reasoning
Consequently, we are of the view that neither clause 12.3 nor 12.7, referable to Section 32 of the Contract Act, will apply so as to enable the grant of compensatory tariff to the respondents.	Reasoning
Dr. Singhvi, however, argued that even if clause 12 is held inapplicable, the law laid down on frustration under Section 56 will apply so as to give the respondents the necessary relief on the ground of force majeure.	Reasoning
Having once held that clause 12.4 applies as a result of which rise in the price of fuel cannot be regarded as a force majeure event contractually, it is difficult to appreciate a submission that in the alternative Section 56 will apply.	Reasoning
As has been held in particular, in the Satyabrata Ghose case, when a contract contains a force majeure clause which on construction by the Court is held attracted to the facts of the case, Section 56 can have no application.	Reasoning
On this short ground, this alternative submission stands disposed of.	None
Change in Law It has been submitted on behalf of the counsel for the respondents, that the guidelines of 19th January, 2005, as amended by the 18th August, 2006 amendment, make it clear that any change in law, either abroad or in India, would result in the consequential rise in price of coal being given to the power generators.

The respondents have argued before us that it is clear from the change made in clause 4.7 of the guidelines read with clause 5.17 that any change in law impacting cost or revenue from the business of selling electricity shall be adjusted separately.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel for the respondents have argued that any change in law is not qualified and, therefore, would include foreign law.	Arguments of Respondent
According to them, the power purchase agreement is subservient to the guidelines and can never negate the terms of the guidelines.	Arguments of Respondent
Under clauses 4.7 and 5.1.7 of the guidelines, these guidelines are binding on all parties including the procurers and any deviation therefrom has to be approved by the appropriate Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, according to them, the PPA must be read as including foreign laws as well.	Arguments of Respondent
On the other hand, our attention was invited to the definition of electricity laws and it was argued that clause 13 would have to be read in the light of the PPA provisions and so read it would not include changes in Indonesian law, being foreign and not Indian Law.	Arguments of Respondent
Both the guidelines and the model PPA, of which clause 13 is a part, have been drafted by the Central Government itself.	None
It is, therefore, clear that the PPA only fleshes out what is mentioned in clause 4.7 of the guidelines, and goes on to explain what the expression any change in law means.	None
This being the case, it is clear that the definition of law speaks of all laws including electricity laws in force in India.	None
Electricity laws, as has been seen from the definition, means the Electricity Act, rules and regulations made thereunder from time to time, and any other law pertaining to electricity.	None
This being so, it is clear that the expression in force in India in the definition of law goes with all laws.	None
This is for the reason that otherwise the said expression would become tautologous, as electricity laws that are in force in India are already referred to in the definition of electricity laws as contained in the PPA.	None
Once this is clear, at least textually it is clear that all laws would have to be read with in force in India and would, therefore, refer only to Indian laws.	None
Even otherwise, from a reading of clause 13, it is clear that clause 13.1.1 is in four different parts.	None
The first part speaks of enacted laws the second speaks of interpretation of such laws by Courts or other instrumentalities the third speaks of changes in consents, approvals or licences which result in change in cost of the business of selling electricity and the fourth refers to any change in the declared law of the land for the project, cost of implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation or cost of implementing the environmental management plan.	None
Competent Court in clause 13.1.2 is defined as meaning only the judicial system of India.	None
First and foremost, the expression any law occurs in both subsection (1) and subsection (2) of clause 13.1.1, which expression must be given the same meaning in both subsections.	None
This being the case, as in subclause (2), this expression would refer only to Indian law, the same meaning will have to be given to the very same expression in subclause (1).	None
Even otherwise, subclauses (1) and (2) form part of the same contractual scheme in that subclause (1) refers to the enactment of laws, whereas subclause (2) relates to interpretation of those very laws by a competent Court of law Tribunal or Indian Government instrumentality.	None
Competent Court, as we have seen above, speaks only of the Indian judicial system and, therefore, the enactments spoken of in subclause (1) would necessarily refer only to Indian enactments.	None
However, we were referred to other clauses in the PPA, for example, clauses 12.4(f)(ii), 4.1.1(a) and 17.1, all of which speak of Indian law.	Arguments of Respondent
It was, therefore, argued that wherever the parties wanted to refer to Indian law, they did so explicitly, and from this it should be inferred that the expression law would otherwise include all laws whether Indian or otherwise.	Arguments of Respondent
This argument is based on the Latin maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius.	None
This maxim has been referred to in a number of judgments of this Court in which it has been described as a useful servant but a dangerous master.	None
(See for example CCE v. National Tobacco Co. of India Ltd., (1972) 2 SCC 560 at Para 30).	None
From a reading of the above, it is clear that if otherwise the expression any law in clause 13 when read with the definition of law and Electricity Laws leads unequivocally to the conclusion that it refers only to the law of India, it would be unsafe to rely upon the other clauses of the agreement where Indian law is specifically mentioned to negate this conclusion.	Reasoning
It was also argued, placing reliance upon the fact that a commercial contract is to be interpreted in a manner which gives business efficacy to such contract, that the subject matter of the PPA being imported coal, obviously the expression any law would refer to laws governing coal that is imported from other countries.	Arguments of Respondent
We are afraid, we cannot agree with this argument.	None
There are many PPAs entered into with different generators.	Reasoning
Some generators may source fuel only from India.	Reasoning
Others, as is the case in the Adani Haryana matter, would source fuel to the extent of 70 from India and 30 from abroad, whereas other generators, as in the case of Gujarat Adani and the Coastal case, would source coal wholly from abroad.	Reasoning
The meaning of the expression change in law in clause 13 cannot depend upon whether coal is sourced in a particular PPA from outside India or within India.	Reasoning
The meaning will have to remain the same whether coal is sourced wholly in India, partly in India and partly from outside, or wholly from outside.	Reasoning
This being the case, the meaning of the expression any law in clause 13 cannot possibly be interpreted in the manner suggested by the respondents.	Reasoning
English judgments and authorities were cited for the proposition that if performance of a contract is to be done in a foreign country, what would be relevant would be foreign law.	Reasoning
This would be true as a general statement of law, but for the reason given above, would not apply to the PPAs in the present case.	None
However, in so far as the applicability of clause 13 to a change in Indian law is concerned, the respondents are on firm ground.	None
It will be seen that under clause 13.1.1 if there is a change in any consent, approval or licence available or obtained for the project, otherwise than for the default of the seller, which results in any change in any cost of the business of selling electricity, then the said seller will be governed under clause 13.1.1.	None
It is clear from a reading of the Resolution dated 21st June, 2013, which resulted in the letter of 31st July, 2013, issued by the Ministry of Power, that the earlier coal distribution policy contained in the letter dated 18th March, 2007 stands modified as the Government has now approved a revised arrangement for supply of coal.	None
It has been decided that, seeing the overall domestic availability and the likely requirement of power projects, the power projects will only be entitled to a certain percentage of what was earlier allowable.	None
This being the case, on 31st July, 2013, the following letter, which is set out in extenso states as follows FU12/2011IPC (VolIII) Government of India Ministry of Power Shram Shakti Bhawan, New Delhi Dated 31st July, 2013 To, The Secretary, Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, Chanderlok Building, Janpath, New Delhi Subject Impact on tariff in the concluded PPAs due to shortage in domestic coal availability and consequent changes in NCDP.

Further amendments to the Tariff Policy were notified on 31st March, 2008, 20th January, 2011 and 8th July, 2011.	None
In exercise of powers conferred under Section 3(3) of Electricity Act, 2003, the Central Government hereby notifies the revised Tariff Policy to be effective from the date of publication of the resolution in the Gazette of India.	None
Notwithstanding anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the provisions of the Tariff Policy notified on 6th January, 2006 and amendments made thereunder, shall, in so far as it is not inconsistent with this Policy, be deemed to have been done or taken under provisions of this revised policy.	None
Clause 6.1 states 6.1 Procurement of Power As stipulated in para 5.1, power procurement for future requirements should be through a transparent competitive bidding mechanism using the guidelines issued by the Central Government from time to time.	None
These guidelines provide for procurement of electricity separately for base load requirements and for peak load requirements.	None
This would facilitate setting up of generation capacities specifically for meeting such requirements.	None
However, some of the competitively bid projects as per the guidelines dated 19th January, 2005 have experienced difficulties in getting the required quantity of coal from Coal India Limited (CIL).	None
In case of reduced quantity of domestic coal supplied by CIL, visavis the assured quantity or quantity indicated in Letter of Assurance FSA the cost of imported market based eauction coal procured for making up the shortfall, shall be considered for being made a pass through by Appropriate Commission on a case to case basis, as per advisory issued by Ministry of Power vide OM NO.FU12/2011IPC (VolIII) dated 31.7.2013.	None
Both the letter dated 31st July, 2013 and the revised tariff policy are statutory documents being issued under Section 3 of the Act and have the force of law.	None
This being so, it is clear that so far as the procurement of Indian coal is concerned, to the extent that the supply from Coal India and other Indian sources is cut down, the PPA read with these documents provides in clause 13.2 that while determining the consequences of change in law, parties shall have due regard to the principle that the purpose of compensating the party affected by such change in law is to restore, through monthly tariff payments, the affected party to the economic position as if such change in law has not occurred.	Reasoning
Further, for the operation period of the PPA, compensation for any increase decrease in cost to the seller shall be determined and be effective from such date as decided by the Central Electricity Regulation Commission.	Reasoning
This being the case, we are of the view that though change in Indonesian law would not qualify as a change in law under the guidelines read with the PPA, change in Indian law certainly would.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, Shri Ramachandran, learned senior counsel for the appellants, argued that the policy dated 18th October, 2007 was announced even before the effective date of the PPAs, and made it clear to all generators that coal may not be given to the extent of the entire quantity allocated.	Arguments of Petitioner
We are afraid that we cannot accede to this argument for the reason that the change in law has only taken place only in 2013, which modifies the 2007 policy and to the extent that it does so, relief is available under the PPA itself to persons who source supply of coal from indigenous sources.	None
It is to this limited extent that change in law is held in favour of the respondents.	Reasoning
Certain other minor contentions that are raised on behalf of both sides are not being addressed by us for the reason that we find it unnecessary to go into the same.	Reasoning
The Appellate Tribunals judgment and the Commissions orders following the said judgment are set aside.	Decision
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission will, as a result of this judgment, go into the matter afresh and determine what relief should be granted to those power generators who fall within clause 13 of the PPA as has been held by us in this judgment.	Decision
All the appeals are disposed of accordingly.	Decision
