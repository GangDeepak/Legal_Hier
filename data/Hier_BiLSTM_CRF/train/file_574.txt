 F. Nariman, J. The present appeal by the Competition Commission of India raises several interesting questions relating to its functions under the Competition Act, 2002.	None
The brief facts necessary to appreciate the controversy which arises in the present case are as follows An agreement dated 1stAugust, 2010 was entered into between respondent no.5, who was the broadcaster of a News Channel called Day Night News, and respondent No.1 to 4 who are Multi System Operators (hereinafter referred to as MSOs) who carried the aforesaid channel to persons who watch Cable T.V.	Facts
A channel placement agreement was entered into, on the same day, between the broadcaster and the MSOs, all of which are stated to belong to the Fast Away Group.	Facts
By notices of termination dated 19thJanuary, 2011, the aforesaid agreements were terminated by relying on a clause of the said agreements which entitled them to do so on the mere giving of a thirty day notice.	Facts
This being the case, respondent no.5 complained about the aforesaid termination.	Facts
The Director General of Investigation looked into the complaint of the broadcaster, investigated the matter, and ultimately delivered its report to the Competition Commission, in which it found that the said MSOs indulged in practices which were violative of Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Commission Act, 2002.	Facts
Going by this report, and after hearing the parties to the dispute, the Competition Commission, by its detailed order dated 3rdJuly, 2012, first held that according to it, the relevant market to be looked at for the purpose of Sections 3 and 4 would be the State of Punjab and Chandigarh.	Facts
Having regard to this market, so far as Cable TV was concerned, a finding was entered stating that the MSO group had 85 of the subscriber share in that market, and was therefore, in a dominant position which could be misused.	Facts
Ultimately, it found on facts that the group had never terminated any such similar agreement before the due date except in the instant case, and also found that this could not be said to be due to low TRP ratings, inasmuch as the complainants TRP rating was almost equal to that of some other channels.	Facts
The Commission then went on to find as follows 6.4.9	None
The evidences as above confirm that there were disruptions in the telecast of the channel.	Facts
The Commission further observes that the OP has argued that as per TRAI regulations it is not bound by must carry, as against the informant who is bound by a must provide provision.	Facts
However, the argument of the OP group does not take away the fact that the informant is dependent on it for transmission of its channel and if it is denied that, it cannot get access to the market.	Facts
It is not that the informant was not paying the placement fee charged by the OP group.	Facts
There was no dispute on nonpayment of placement or carriage charges.	Facts
An agreement was duly executed between the informant and the OP group for transmission of the channels of the former.6.4.10 However, due to the fact that the subscriber base of the OPs is in excess of 40 lacs, every broadcaster including the informant dependent upon their network.	Facts
In such a situation, the Commission observes that the OP is in position to affect the market in its favour.	Facts
Due to its market power, the OP group has denied the opportunity for transmission of channel of the informant.	Facts
The group has no justification for termination of the agreement and its argument for justifying its conduct is not based on any sound footings.	Facts
Its argument regarding shortage of spectrum for nontransmission of the informants channel in face of the fact that the spectrum constraint might have been considered at the time of entering into agreement with the informant upon charge of premium from the broadcaster.	Facts
Once that was considered, the question of shortage of spectrum during the period of the agreement does not arise.	Facts
Similarly, the argument of low TRP is also not justified since in past there has been no practice of review of any agreement on the basis of TRP ratings in the middle of an agreement.	Facts
The Commission observes that the argument of spectrum shortage and low TRP is merely an afterthought to justify its conduct.6.4.11 The conduct of OP has resulted in loss to the informantbroadcaster as well as denial of services to the consumers who want to watch the channel of the informant.	Facts
As on date the Informant has access to only 56,000 households on the cable TV in the state of Punjab Chandigarh, where about 45 lacs households are connected on cable network.	Facts
Thus, the informant has been effectively wiped out from the entire relevant market by the conduct of OPs.6.4.12 In the light of the facts and circumstances of this case the Commission observes that due to the acts of the OP group the informant has been denied the market access and opportunity to compete and holds that violation of the provisions of section 4(2) (c) of the Act gets established.	Facts
Given the aforesaid finding, the Commission thereafter imposed a penalty in exercise of its power under Section 27 of the Act of Rs. 8,40,01,141/.	None
The appeal by the MSOs group to the Appellate Tribunal found favour with the aforesaid Tribunal.	Facts
Essentially, the Tribunals finding was that the denial of market access under Section 4(2)(c) can only be by one competitor against another, and that as a broadcaster cannot be said to compete with MSOs, there would be no violation of either Section 3 or Section 4 of the Act.	Facts
On this short ground the appeal stood allowed.4.	Facts
Shri P.S. Narsimha, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Competition Commission, who is the sole appellant before us, has argued that the role of the Competition Commission is delineated in the preamble read with certain provisions of the Act, as a positive one.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Commission has to prevent practices having an adverse effect on competition, to promote and sustain competition in markets, as also to protect the interest of consumers, so that freedom of trade is ensured which in turn leads to healthy economic development of the nation as a whole.	Arguments of Petitioner
Viewed in this light, and after referring to certain other provisions of the Act, the learned Additional Solicitor General argued that the Appellate Tribunal has construed the Act in a constricted manner which would impede the Commissions functioning in future cases.	Arguments of Petitioner
With his usual fairness, he has left it to the court to decide the amount of penalty that ought to be imposed on the facts of the case.5.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent MSOs has been equally fair to the Court, and has brought to our notice the judgment of the Telecom Disputes and Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) dated 25th April, 2012 in which this very termination by the MSOs in the present case was held to be unlawful, in that Regulation 4.2 of the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable Services) Interconnection Regulations, 2004 was breached.	Arguments of Respondent
Clause 4.2 of the aforesaid Regulation, which overrides agreements between the parties, specifically speaks about a three weeknotice to the broadcaster clearly giving reasons for the proposed action of effacing transmission of a TV channel by the aforesaid MSOs.	Arguments of Respondent
The notice of termination dated 19thJanuary, 2011 do not conform to the aforesaid Regulation as reasons for the proposed termination have not been given.	Arguments of Respondent
He further argues that no case for penalty has been made out against his clients for the reason that at the relevant time, the analogue platform was used, and the operational capacity of such platform was only for 80 channels as against the existing channels of about 550.	Arguments of Respondent
He went on to add that the TRP ratings of the broadcaster, namely, respondent No. 5, was the lowest by far among all other news channels, getting a rating of only 3.8 as against the lowest rated news channel, which was MH Channel, of 7.	Arguments of Respondent
This, according to him, was because of an experiment conducted by respondent No. 5 which failed, because it broadcast news in three different languages, and since most of the viewers were not familiar with each of these languages, the channel failed and respondent No. 5 was no longer in business.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, according to him, even though technically speaking, Regulation 4.2 was breached, yet a notice of termination could have been given stating the aforesaid reasons as to why the agreement between the MSOs and the broadcaster was terminated.	Arguments of Respondent
This being the case it is clear that the termination of the agreement did not take place because of the MSOs dominant position in the market, but because of the factors aforestated.	Arguments of Respondent
In his view, therefore, this is not a case in which penalty should have been imposed.	Arguments of Respondent
We have heard learned counsel for the parties.	None

None
Section 60 Act to have overriding effectThe provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.	None
The Preamble of the Act, read with the aforesaid provisions, would show that the Commission set up by the Competition Act certainly has a positive role to play.	Reasoning
A perusal of Sections18 and 19 would show that it is a positive duty of the Commission to eliminate all practices which have an adverse effect on competition.	Reasoning
Further the Commission should promote and sustain competition, apart from protecting the interest of consumers, so as to ensure freedom of trade carried on by all participants in markets all over India.	Reasoning
Also, a positive role is given to the Commission to inquire, suo motu, into the dominant position of enterprises, and to prohibit anti competitive agreements.	Reasoning
Section 60 then gives the Act overriding effect over other statutes in case of a clash between the Act and such statues to effectuate the policy of the Act, keeping in view the economic development of the country as a whole.8.	Reasoning
On the facts of the present case, it is clear that dominant position is clearly made out.	Reasoning
The Explanation to Section 4 specifically refers to a position of strength that is enjoyed by an enterprise or group thereof in the relevant market, which, as is stated hereinbefore, is Punjab and Chandigarh, in the Cable TV market, which enables respondents no. 14 to operate independently of competitive forces prevailing in the relevant market.	Reasoning
The Commission has found, on facts, that since the aforesaid MSOs group has 85 of the subscribers share in the aforesaid cable TV market in the State of Punjab and Chandigarh, and that they are able to operate independently of competitive forces prevailing in the aforesaid market.	Reasoning
This finding has notbeen set aside by the Appellate Tribunal.	Reasoning
Also, the respondent would fall within Explanation (a)(ii) as well, though it is enough that it would fall within subsection a(i) of the Explanation.	None
Subsection (ii) refers to a position of strength as enjoyed by the respondents which enables them to affect consumers in its favour.9.	None
Replying upon the definition in Section 2(f)(ii), ShriNarsimha, learned ASG has, in our view, correctly argued that a broadcaster would certainly fall within the wide language contained in the aforesaid subsection.	Reasoning
We may also add that in all fairness the learned counsel for the respondent has agreed with the same.	None
This being the case, it is clear that as both subsections (i) and (ii) of clause (a) of the Explanation apply, the respondent could be said to be in a dominant position, for the purpose of Section 4, in the facts of the present case.10.	Reasoning
The question which now arises is whether there is an abuse of such dominant position under Section 4(2)(c) where the respondent could be stated to have indulged in a practice resulting in denial of market access in any manner.	Issue
It can be seen that in the facts of the case, the broadcaster, namely respondent No. 5, had a broadcast agreement which was entered into for a period of one year from 1stAugust, 2010.	Reasoning
This was sought to be terminated within the aforesaid period by the respondent by notices dated 19thJanuary, 2011.	Reasoning
The TDSAT has, by its order dated 25thApril, 2012, adverted to Regulation 4.2 of the relevant Telecom Regulations, and has found that the respondents have not followed the aforesaid regulations, inasmuch as no reasons for termination have been given in the notices of termination.	Reasoning
This being the case, it is clear that, on the present facts, there is an abuse of the dominant position enjoyed by the respondents 14 only for the reason that the broadcaster was denied market access on and after 19thFebruary, 2011 until 1st August, 2011.	None
The words in any manner one of wide import and must be given their natural meaning.	None
This being the case, it is difficult to appreciate the reasoning of the Appellate Tribunal that, as the broadcaster and MSOs are not in competition with one another, the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 do not get attracted.	None
As has been held by us, the dominant position held by the respondent MSOs is clearly established for the purpose of Section 4 in the present case, and the Commission finding in that behalf is also not set aside by the Appellate Tribunal.	None
If this be so, then once a dominant position is made out on facts, whether a broadcaster is in competition with MSOs is a factor that is irrelevant for the purpose of application of Section 4(2)(c) which, as has been found by us, becomes applicable for the simple reason that the broadcaster is denied market access due to an unlawful termination of the agreement between the said broadcaster and the respondents 14.	None
Having said this, however, we are of the view that no penalty ought to have been imposed on the facts of the present case.	None
The finding of the Competition Commission that TRP rating of the broadcaster was not so low as it was almost equal to that of other channels, is not correct.	Reasoning
In the counter affidavit filed before us by the respondent, they have specifically stated the TAM ratings of the respondent channel, as opposed to other news channels, from the month of September 2010 to January 2011, were as follows No.Name of the ChannelAverage GRP of the Channel during five month period (Sept.10 Jan.11) AAJ TAK33.6 Day and Night News3.8 IBN724.7 MH1 News7.0 NDTV India22.5	None
PTC News35.6 Star News27.9 Zee News21.5	None
A perusal of the aforesaid chart would show that the GRP given to the news channel Day and Night is much lower than that given to any other channel, and that learned senior counsel for the respondent was correct in stating that this was the reason for terminating the agreement with the broadcaster in midstream.	Reasoning
Though we find that, on the facts of this case, Section 4(2)(c) has been breached, yet the reason given by respondents 1 to 4 for termination being otherwise justifiable, we feel that no penalty should be levied on the facts of the present case.14.	None
The appeal is accordingly allowed, and the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal, as well as the penalty imposed by the Competition Commission, both stand set aside.	Decision
