After considering the rival submissions and the relevant clauses in the MOS dated 4.5.2015 and after considering the obligations of the Seth Group and the obligations of the Mittal Group under MOS dated 4.5.2015 and after having noted and considered the material on record, this Court in the earlier detailed order dated 24.4.2020 specifically held that the Mittal Group have deliberately and wilfully not fulfilled their obligations which are required to be fulfilled under MOS dated 4.5.2015.	Facts
This Court also opined that as such Mittal Group have rendered themselves liable for the action under the Contempt of Courts Act.	Facts
However, before taking any further action, this Court granted further two months time to the Mittal Group, namely, Shri Sumit Mittal, Shri Madhur Mittal and TFIPL, to fulfil their part of obligations under MOS dated 4.5.2015, more particularly, To pay the entire EDC liability of TFIPL with interest in relation to license Nos. 34, 35 and 36 other than the share of the EDC liability which the Seth Group has undertaken to pay as per Clause 1.2 of the MOS As per Clause 1.2, EDC liability of the Seth Group is to the extent of Rs.25,27,92,000/, out of the total EDC liability of TFIPL in relation License Nos. 34, 35 and 36 as on 24.03.2015 together with interest accrued thereon from 24.03.2015.

Facts
It appears that despite the above specific directions, license numbers 34, 35 and 36 of 2007 are not renewed by the Mittal Group and because of the nonrenewal of the aforesaid licensees, even the balance amount of EDC liability has not been paid by the Seth Group and even the Mittal Group has also not paid their liability towards the EDC in respect of the aforesaid license numbers 34, 35 and 36 of 2007 and therefore the ultimate sufferer is the home buyers who are waiting for their homes.
