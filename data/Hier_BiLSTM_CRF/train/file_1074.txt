For arriving at this conclusion, the Reference Court assigned the following reasons Now what is to be seen is Whether future potentiality of construction of buildings existed in the lands acquired?	None
Petitioners have examined Himmat Singh (P.W.1) who has stated that the date on which the lands were acquired, it was fully developed for agricultural purposes and there were several government offices e.g. Tehsil, S.D.O. Office, B.D.O. Office, Forest Department, Residence of Civil Judge, SubJail, Silk Industry Center, Rest House, Hospitals etc., near the acquired lands and all of the above are residential houses wherein Doctors and Advocates are also living.	None
Apart from this, there is a metalled road of P.W.D. on the south of the lands towards Village Rai and on the north there is a metalled road of P.W.D. going towards Village Mohara.	Facts
On the south there is an ancient temple on which a huge fair is celebrated every year.	Facts
More than 90 of the Government Offices of the Kolaras Sub Division are situated in Jagatpur and Jagatpur is situated near the AgraMumbai National Highway and a metalled road goes upto Sant Farm from this AgraMumbai National Highway.	Facts
These statements of the witness have not been challenged during his cross examination.	None
Apart from him, another witness of the petitioner namely Rishabh Chand (P.W.2) in his statement has stated that he is an ExM.L.A. and Chairman of Kolaras.	None
The entire development of Kolaras is presently towards Jagatpur side.	Facts

Hence it is clear from the above that the acquired lands are close to the residential lands and bore potential of construction of buildings at the time of acquisition.	Facts
In the circumstances it is clear that the determination of compensation of these lands by treating them as agricultural lands is unfair, arbitrary and insufficient and also contrary to the provisions of Section 231 of the Land Acquisition Act.	Facts
Resultantly, Issue no.l is hereby decided in affirmative i.e.	None
Yes.	None
The Reference Court relied upon sale deeds Exhibits P7 to P9 and concluded that market value of the acquired land is Rs.3 per sq. ft.	Facts
The Reference Court then applied various deductions and held that the appellants are entitled to compensation of Rs.80,240/ for land measuring 1,69,805 sq. ft.	Facts

The appeals were accordingly disposed of by declaring that the appellants are entitled to compensation for the land acquired vide notification dated 28.5.1987 at the rate of Re.1 per sq. ft with other statutory benefits like solatium and interest.	Facts
Shri U. U. Lalit, learned senior counsel for the appellants argued that the Reference Court and the High Court committed serious error by excluding various sale instances only on the ground that the contents thereof were not proved by examining the buyer and the seller.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Lalit invited the Courts attention to Section 51A of the Act and the judgments in Land Acquisition Officer and Mandal Revenue Officer v. V. Narasaiah (2001) 3 SCC 530 , Cement Corporation of India v. Purya (2004) 8 SCC 270 and Deputy Collector, Land Acquisition, Gujarat and another v. Madhubai Gobarbhai and another (2009) 15 SCC 125 and argued that the view expressed by the Reference Court and approved by the learned Single Judge of the High Court on the admissibility and relevance of the copies of the registered sale deeds is liable to be overturned.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Lalit further argued that the Reference Court and the High Court committed serious error by not taking into consideration the highest value reflected in the sale deeds Exhibits P4 and P5 for the purpose of determination of compensation.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of this argument, Shri Lalit relied upon the judgments in Rao Bahadur, Collector of Madras 1969 1 MLJ 45 , State of Punjab v. Hansraj (1994) 5 SCC 734 , Anjani Molu Dessai v. State of Goa (2010) 13 SCC 710 , Mehrawal Khewaji Trust (Registered), Faridkot and others v. State of Punjab and others (2012) 5 SCC 432.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Lalit then argued that the deductions made by the Reference Court and approved by the High Court are clearly impermissible because the land had been acquired for construction of Broad Gauge Rail Line and not for carving out a lay out for residential, industrial or commercial purpose which necessarily involves construction of road and providing of basic amenities like electricity, water and sewerage and large area is required to be left out as open spaces.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Lalit also referred to documents produced by the appellants showing damage to their land and argued that the Reference Court and the High Court committed serious error by not awarding compensation for severance caused due to construction of railway line and damage caused due to digging.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the end, Shri Lalit relied upon the judgments of this Court in Sunder v. Union of India (2001) 7 SCC 211 and R. Saragapani v. Special Tahsildar, Karur Dindigul Broadguage Line (2011) 14 SCC 177 and argued that the appellants are entitled to interest on solatium.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri R. K. Khanna, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India supported the impugned judgment and argued that the appellants are not entitled to further enhancement in the compensation determined by the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Khanna argued that the sale instances produced by the appellants were in respect of very small parcels of land and the same could not supply basis for fixing market value of big chunks of land measuring 3.627 hectares and 0.951 hectare.	Arguments of Respondent
He further argued that the deductions made by the Reference Court and the High Court in lieu of the cost of development and other charges are legally correct and the High Court did not commit any error by fixing market value of the acquired land for the purpose of determination of the compensation payable to the appellants.15.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of his arguments, Shri Khanna relied upon the judgments in Land Acquiring Body, Ahmedabad v. Ramprasad H. Maharaj (2007) 15 SCC 593, Mahesh Dattatray Thirthkar v. State of Maharashtra (2009) 11 SCC 141 , Sabhia Mohammad Yusuf Abdul Hamid Mulla (dead) by Lrs. and others v. Special Land Acquisition Officer and others (2012) 7 SCC 595 , Bhagwathula Samanna and others v. Special Tahsildar and Land Acquisition Officer, Visakhapatnam Municipality, Visakhapatnam (1991) 4 SCC 506 , V. Hanumantha Reddy (dead) by Lrs.	Arguments of Respondent
v. Land Acquisition officer and Mandal R. Officer (2003) 12 SCC 642 , Valliyammal and another v. Special Tahsildar (Land Acquisition) and another (2011) 8 SCC 91 and K. S. Shivdevamma v. Assistant Collector AIR 1996 SC 2886 .	Arguments of Respondent
Before considering the respective arguments, we may notice the principles laid down by this Court for determination of market value of the acquired land.	None
In Shaji Kuriakose v. Indian Oil Corpn.	None
Ltd. (2001) 7 SCC 650 , this Court held It is no doubt true that courts adopt comparable sales method of valuation of land while fixing the market value of the acquired land.	None
While fixing the market value of the acquired land, comparable sales method of valuation is preferred than other methods of valuation of land such as capitalisation of net income method or expert opinion method.	None
Comparable sales method of valuation is preferred because it furnishes the evidence for determination of the market value of the acquired land at which a willing purchaser would pay for the acquired land if it had been sold in the open market at the time of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Act.	None
However, comparable sales method of valuation of land for fixing the market value of the acquired land is not always conclusive.	None
There are certain factors which are required to be fulfilled and on fulfilment of those factors the compensation can be awarded, according to the value of the land reflected in the sales.	None
The factors laid down inter alia are (1) the sale must be a genuine transaction, (2) that the sale deed must have been executed at the time proximate to the date of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Act, (3) that the land covered by the sale must be in the vicinity of the acquired land, (4) that the land covered by the sales must be similar to the acquired land, and (5) that the size of plot of the land covered by the sales be comparable to the land acquired.	None
If all these factors are satisfied, then there is no reason why the sale value of the land covered by the sales be not given for the acquired land.	None
However, if there is a dissimilarity in regard to locality, shape, site or nature of land between land covered by sales and land acquired, it is open to the court to proportionately reduce the compensation for acquired land than what is reflected in the sales depending upon the disadvantages attached with the acquired land.	None
In Viluben Jhalejar Contractor v. State of Gujarat (2005) 4 SCC 789 , this Court elaborately considered the matter and culled out the following principles One of the principles for determination of the amount of compensation for acquisition of land would be the willingness of an informed buyer to offer the price therefor.	None
It is beyond any cavil that the price of the land which a willing and informed buyer would offer would be different in the cases where the owner is in possession and enjoyment of the property and in the cases where he is not.	None
Market value is ordinarily the price the property may fetch in the open market if sold by a willing seller unaffected by the special needs of a particular purchase.	None
Where definite material is not forthcoming either in the shape of sales of similar lands in the neighbourhood at or about the date of notification under Section 4(1) or otherwise, other sale instances as well as other evidences have to be considered.	None
The amount of compensation cannot be ascertained with mathematical accuracy.	None
A comparable instance has to be identified having regard to the proximity from time angle as well as proximity from situation angle.	None
For determining the market value of the land under acquisition, suitable adjustment has to be made having regard to various positive and negative factors visavis the land under acquisition by placing the two in juxtaposition.	None
The positive and negative factors are as underPositive factorsNegative factors(i) smallness of size(i) largeness of area(ii) proximity to a road(ii) situation in the interior at a distance from the road(iii) frontage on a road(iii) narrow strip of land with very small frontage compared to depth(iv) nearness to developed area(iv) lower level requiring the depressed portion to be filled up(v) regular shape(v) remoteness from developed locality(vi) level visavis land under(vi) some special disadvantageous acquisition factors which would deter a purchaser(vii) special value for an owner of an adjoining property to whom it may have some very special advantage?Whereas a smaller plot may be within the reach of many, a large block of land will have to be developed preparing a layout plan, carving out roads, leaving open spaces, plotting out smaller plots, waiting for purchasers and the hazards of an entrepreneur.	None
Such development charges may range between 20 and 50 of the total price.	None
In Atma Singh v. State of Haryana (2008) 2 SCC 568 , the Court held In order to determine the compensation which the tenureholders are entitled to get for their land which has been acquired, the main question to be considered is what is the market value of the land.	None
Section 23(1) of the Act lays down what the court has to take into consideration while Section 24 lays down what the court shall not take into consideration and have to be neglected.	None
The main object of the enquiry before the court is to determine the market value of the land acquired.	None
The expression market value has been the subjectmatter of consideration by this Court in several cases.	None
The market value is the price that a willing purchaser would pay to a willing seller for the property having due regard to its existing condition with all its existing advantages and its potential possibilities when led out in most advantageous manner excluding any advantage due to carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired.	None
In considering market value disinclination of the vendor to part with his land and the urgent necessity of the purchaser to buy should be disregarded.	None
The guiding star would be the conduct of hypothetical willing vendor who would offer the land and a purchaser in normal human conduct would be willing to buy as a prudent man in normal market conditions but not an anxious dealing at arms length nor facade of sale nor fictitious sale brought about in quick succession or otherwise to inflate the market value.	None
The determination of market value is the prediction of an economic event viz.	None
a price outcome of hypothetical sale expressed in terms of probabilities.	None
See Kamta Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar (1976) 3 SCC 772 , Prithvi Raj Taneja v. State of M.P. (1977) 1 SCC 684 , Administrator General of W.B. v. Collector (1988) 2 SCC 150 and Periyar Pareekanni Rubbers Ltd. v. State of Kerala (1991) 4 SCC 195.	None
For ascertaining the market value of the land, the potentiality of the acquired land should also be taken into consideration.	None
Potentiality means capacity or possibility for changing or developing into state of actuality.	None
It is well settled that market value of a property has to be determined having due regard to its existing condition with all its existing advantages and its potential possibility when led out in its most advantageous manner.	None
The question whether a land has potential value or not, is primarily one of fact depending upon its condition, situation, user to which it is put or is reasonably capable of being put and proximity to residential, commercial or industrial areas or institutions.	None
The existing amenities like water, electricity, possibility of their further extension, whether near about a town is developing or has prospect of development have to be taken into consideration.	None
See Collector v. Dr. Harisingh Thakur (1979) 1 SCC 236 , Raghubans Narain Singh v. U.P. Govt.	None
AIR 1967 SC 465 and Administrator General of W.B. v. Collector (1988) 2 SCC 150.	None
It has been held in Kausalya Devi Bogra v. Land Acquisition Officer (1984) 2 SCC 324 and Suresh Kumar v. Town Improvement Trust (1989) 2 SCC 329 that failing to consider potential value of the acquired land is an error of principle.	None
We shall now deal with the question whether the Reference Court was legally entitled to discard the sale deeds Exhibits P1 to P6 and P10 to P12 and whether the market value could have been determined only on the basis of Exhibits P7 to P9 and also whether the learned Single Judge of the High Court was right in relying upon Exhibits P1 and P7 to P9 for recording a finding that the Reference Court had correctly treated market value of the acquired land as Rs.6 per sq. ft. for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation.	Facts
Admittedly, the appellants had produced as many as 12 sale deeds, the details of which (as contained in the written note filed by learned counsel for the appellants on 27.11.2013) are given below Exhibit No.DateAreaTotal considerationRateP110.07.19862000	None

hectaresRe.0.09(Being an example rural agricultural land beyond Jagatpur cited as aContrast example)	None
Since all the sale deeds produced by the appellants were registered documents and authenticity thereof had not been questioned by the respondents, the Reference Court and the High Court could not have ignored the provisions of Section 51A and discarded majority of the sale deeds.	None
This issue is no longer res integra and must be answered in favour of the appellants in view of the judgments in Land Acquisition Officer and Mandal Revenue Officer v. V. Narasaiah (supra), Cement Corporation of India v. Purya (supra) and Deputy Collector, Land Acquisition, Gujarat and another v. Madhubai Gobarbhai and another (supra).	None
Notwithstanding the above conclusion, we are of the view that Exhibits P2 and P10 cannot be relied upon for determination of the amount of compensation because the same were executed after the issue of notification under Section 4.	None
The remaining sale deeds show that different parcels of land were sold between 10.2.1984 and 19.1.1987.	None
The highest value for which the land was sold was Rs.17.86 per sq. ft and the lowest was Rs.3 per sq. ft.	None
In Anjani Molu Dessai v. State of Goa (supra), a two Judge Bench considered the methodology which should be followed for fixing market value of the acquired land where large number of sale instances are produced by the parties, referred to the earlier judgments in M. Vijayalakshmamma Rao Bahadur v. Collector (1969) 1 MLJ 45 , State of Punjab v. Hans Raj (1994) 5 SCC 734 and held The legal position is that even where there are several exemplars with reference to similar lands, usually the highest of the exemplars, which is a bona fide transaction, will be considered.	None
Where however there are several sales of similar lands whose prices range in a narrow bandwidth, the average thereof can be taken, as representing the market price.	None
But where the values disclosed in respect of two sales are markedly different, it can only lead to an inference that they are with reference to dissimilar lands or that the lower value sale is on account of undervaluation or other price depressing reasons.	None
Consequently, averaging cannot be resorted to.	None
In Mehrawal Khewaji Trust (Registered), Faridkot and others v. State of Punjab and others (supra), another two Judge Bench restated the law in the following words It is clear that when there are several exemplars with reference to similar lands, it is the general rule that the highest of the exemplars, if it is satisfied that it is a bona fide transaction, has to be considered and accepted.	None
When the land is being compulsorily taken away from a person, he is entitled to the highest value which similar land in the locality is shown to have fetched in a bona fide transaction entered into between a willing purchaser and a willing seller near about the time of the acquisition.	None
In our view, it seems to be only fair that where sale deeds pertaining to different transactions are relied on behalf of the Government, the transaction representing the highest value should be preferred to the rest unless there are strong circumstances justifying a different course.	None
It is not desirable to take an average of various sale deeds placed before the authority court for fixing fair compensation.	None
The same view was reiterated in Chindha Fakira Patil v. The Special Land Acquisition officer, Jalgaon 2011 (12) SCALE 321.	None
It was neither the pleaded case of the respondents nor any evidence was produced by them before the Reference Court to prove that the sale transactions Exhibits P4 and P5 were not genuine or that the vendor and vendee had colluded to inflate value of the land with oblique motive.	None
It is also not the case of the respondents that the lands specified in other exhibits was sold at the rate of Rs.8.33, Rs.8.08 or Rs.8 per sq. ft. with ulterior motive to get higher compensation in the subsequent acquisitions.	None
Therefore, we can safely rely upon Exhibits P4 and P5 for determining the amount of compensation.	None
Even if those sale deeds are kept aside, one can rely upon Exhibits P3, P7 and P8 for recording a finding that market value of the acquired land cannot be less than anything between Rs.8 and Rs.8.33 per sq. ft.	None
If the rule of averaging is applied, then market value of the acquired land would be anything between Rs.9 and Rs.10 per sq. ft.	None
The next issue which merits consideration is whether the Reference Court and the High Court had correctly made deductions in the name of development charges cost of development.	Issue
The Reference Court made three tier deduction.	None
In the first place, 25 was deducted in the name of leaving out portions of the acquired land for the purpose of laying roads, drains, sewer line, parks, electricity line etc.	None
Thereafter, 25 deduction was made towards expenses for development work.	None
Finally, 50 deduction was made because of smallness of the plots sold vide Exhibits P1 to P12.	None
The learned Single Judge of the High Court approved the deduction and determined market value of the acquired land at the rate of Re.1 per sq. ft.	Facts
The approach adopted by the Reference Court and the High Court in making deductions towards the cost of development development charges from the market value determined on the basis of the sale deeds produced by the appellants was clearly wrong.	None
The respondents had not even suggested that the development envisaged by the Reference Court, i.e., laying of roads, drains, sewer lines, parks, electricity lines etc. or any other development work was required to be undertaken for laying the Railway line.	None
Therefore, 25 deduction made by the Reference Court and approved by the High Court under two different heads is legally unsustainable.	None
In Nelson Fernandes and others v. Special Land Acquisition Officer, South Goa and others (2007) 9 SCC 447 , this Court considered the question whether any deduction could be made towards development cost where the land is acquired for laying railway line and answered the same in negative.	None
In that case, the appellant had challenged the judgments of the Reference Court and the Division Bench of the High Court fixing market value of the acquired land and contended that no deduction could be made because the land had been acquired for laying railway line.	None
This Court reversed the judgments of the Reference Court and the High Court and observed Both the Special Land Acquisition Officer, the District Judge and of the High Court have failed to notice that the purpose of acquisition is for Railways and that the purpose is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration for fixing the compensation.	None
In this context, we may usefully refer the judgment of this Court in Viluben Jhalejar Contractor v. State of Gujarat.	None
This Court held that the purpose for which the land is acquired must also be taken into consideration in fixing the market value and the deduction of development charges.	None
In the above case, the lands were acquired because they were submerged under water of a dam.	None
Owners claimed compensation of Rs 40 per sq ft. LAO awarded compensation ranging from Rs 35 to Rs 60 per sq m. Reference Court fixed the market value of the land at Rs 200 per sq m and after deduction of development charges, determined the compensation Rs 134 per sq m. In arriving at the compensation, Reference Court placed reliance on the comparative sale of a piece of land measuring 46.30 sq m Rs 270 per sq m. On appeal, the High Court awarded compensation of Rs 180 per sq m in respect of large plots and Rs 200 per sq m in respect of smaller plots.	None
On further appeal, this Court held that since the lands were acquired for being submerged in water of dam and had no potential value and the sale instance relied was a small plot measuring 46.30 sq m whereas the acquisition in the present case was in respect of large area, interest of justice would be subserved by awarding compensation of Rs 160 per sq m in respect of larger plots and Rs 175 per sq m for smaller plots.	None
In Basavva v. Spl.	None
Land Acquisition Officer this Court held that the purpose for which acquisition is made is also a relevant factor for determining the market value.30.	None
We are not, however, oblivious of the fact that normally 1/3rd deduction of further amount of compensation has been directed in some cases.	None
However, the purpose for which the land is acquired must also be taken into consideration.	None
In the instant case, the land was acquired for the construction of new BG line for the Konkan Railways.	None
This Court in Hasanali Khanbhai Sons v. State of Gujarat and Land Acquisition Officer v. Nookala Rajamallu had noticed that where lands are acquired for specific purposes, deduction by way of development charges is permissible.	None
In the instant case, acquisition is for laying a railway line.	None
Therefore, the question of development thereof would not arise.	None
Therefore, the order passed by the High Court is liable to be set aside and in view of the availability of basic civic amenities such as school, bank, police station, water supply, electricity, highway, transport, post, petrol pump, industry, telecommunication and other businesses, the claim of compensation should reasonably be fixed Rs 250 per sq m with the deduction of 20.	None
The appellant shall be entitled to all other statutory benefits such as solatium, interest, etc. etc.	None
The appellants also will be entitled to compensation for the trees standing on the said land in a sum of Rs.59,192 as fixed.	None
IA No. 1 of 2006 for substitution is ordered as prayed for.	None
In C.R. Nagaraja Shetty v. Special Land Acquisition Officer and Estate Officer and another (2009) 11 SCC 75 , the Court referred to the judgment in Nelson Fernandes and others v. Special Land Acquisition Officer, South Goa and others (supra) and observed The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents was also unable to point out any such evidence regarding the proposed development.	None
We cannot ignore the fact that the land is acquired only for the widening of the national highway.	None
There would, therefore, be no question of any such development or any costs therefor.16.	None
In Nelson Fernandes v. Land Acquisition Officer this Court has discussed the question of development charges.	None
That was a case where the acquisition was for laying a railway line.	None
This Court found that the land under acquisition was situated in an area which was adjacent to the land already acquired for the same purpose i.e. for laying a railway line.	None
In para 29, the Court observed that the Land Acquisition Officer, the District Judge and the High Court had failed to notice that the purpose of acquisition was for the Railways and that the purpose is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration for fixing the compensation.17.	None
The Court in Nelson Fernandes relied on Viluben Jhalejar Contractor v. State of Gujarat where it was held that29.	None
the purpose for which the land is acquired must also be taken into consideration in fixing the market value and the deduction of development charges.	None
Further, in para 30, the Court specifically referred to the deduction for the development charges and observed30.	None
We are not, however, oblivious of the fact that normally 1/3rd deduction of further amount of compensation has been directed in some cases.	None
However, the purpose for which the land is acquired must also be taken into consideration.	None
In the instant case, the land was acquired for the construction of new BG line for the Konkan Railways.	None
In the instant case, acquisition is for laying a railway line.	None
Therefore, the question of development thereof would not arise.	None
The Court made a reference to two other cases viz.	None
Hasanali Khanbhai Sons v. State of Gujarat and Land Acquisition Officer v. Nookala Rajamallu where the deduction by way of development charges was held permissible.18.	None
The situation is no different in the present case.	None
All that the acquiring body has to achieve is to widen the national highway.	None
There is no further question of any development.	None
We again, even at the cost of repetition, reiterate that no evidence was shown before us in support of the plea of the proposed development.	None
We, therefore, hold that the High Court has erred in directing the deduction on account of the developmental charges at the rate of Rs 25 per square foot out of the ordered compensation at the rate of Rs 75 per square foot.	None
We set aside the judgment to that extent.	None
However, keeping in view the smallness of the plots which were sold by Exhibits P1, P3 to P8, P11 and P12, we would approve the deduction of 50 for the purpose of determining compensation payable for 3.627 hectares comprised in Survey Nos.2, 10, 20, 22, 46, 48 and 106 and 0.951 hectare comprised in Survey No.18.31.	Reasoning
The issue which remains to be considered relates to the amount of compensation payable to the appellants.	Reasoning
For this purpose, we shall make calculation by adopting the following modes If sale deeds Exhibits P4 and P5 are relied upon and 50 deduction is made on account of smallness of the land sold by these exhibits, the amount of compensation would come to Rs.8.93 per sq. ft., andii)	Reasoning
If sale deeds Exhibits P3, P6 to P9 and P11 are taken into consideration and 50 deduction is made due to smallness of the plots, the appellants would be entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.4.04 per sq. ft.	Reasoning
However, keeping in view the proposition laid down in M. Vijayalakshmamma Rao Bahadur v. Collector (supra), State of Punjab v. Hans Raj (supra), Anjani Molu Dessai v. State of Goa (supra) and Mehrawal Khewaji Trust (Registered), Faridkot and others v. State of Punjab and others (supra), we would adopt the first mode and hold that the appellants are entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.8.93 per sq. ft.33.	Reasoning
We may have ordained payment of compensation to the appellants at the rate of 8.93 per sq. ft.	Reasoning
(rounded off to Rs.9 per sq. ft.), but having regard to the fact that in the claim filed before the Reference Court, they had limited their claim to Rs.5 per sq. ft. and no application was filed either before the High Court or this Court for payment of higher compensation, we would restrict the enhancement to Rs.5 per sq.ft.34.	Reasoning
We agree with Shri Lalit that in view of the law laid down in Sunder v. Union of India (2001) 7 SCC 211 , Chimanlal Kuberdas Modi v. Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (2010) 10 SCC 635 , Nadirsha Shapurji Patel v. Collector and LAO (2010) 13 SCC 234 , R. Saragapani v. Special Tahsildar, Karur Dindigul Broadguage Line (2011) 14 SCC 177 and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited v. R.S. Avtar Singh and Company (2013) 1 SCC 243 , the appellants are entitled to interest on solatium.35.	Reasoning
So far as the appellants plea for award of damages caused on account of removal of fencing of Sant Farm, loss of earning due to damage to crops farming operation and destruction of well existing on the land is concerned, we do not consider it necessary to deal with the same because the issue is being dealt with in C.A. No.1248 of 2007.	Reasoning
In the result, the appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment and the award of the Reference Court are set aside and it is declared that the appellants are entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.5 per sq.ft.	Decision
with other statutory benefits.	Decision
They shall also be entitled to interest on the element of solatium.37.	Decision
The respondents are directed to pay the amount of enhanced compensation and other statutory benefits including solatium and interest to the appellants within a period of six months from today.	Decision
S. Singhvi, J. Feeling dissatisfied with the meagre enhancement granted by the learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the amount of compensation determined by II Additional District Judge, Shivpuri (hereinafter described as, the Reference Court), the appellants have filed this appeal.	Issue
By letter dated 27.12.1988, Collector, Shivpuri proposed the acquisition of 4.421 hectares land for construction of link road near GunaShivpuri Rail Line.	None
However, even before issue of the notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, the Act), possession of the land was taken by the officers of the Central Railway and link road was constructed.	None
On 16.1.1989, the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act was published.	None
However, the same was cancelled on account of discrepancies in the area of the land proposed to be acquired.	None
After about four months, the Collector proposed the acquisition of 4.788 hectares land of which possession had already been taken.	None
Thereupon, the Government of Madhya Pradesh issued notification dated 23.5.1991 under Section 4(1), which was published on 27.12.1991 for the acquisition of land measuring 4.788 hectares.	None
The Land Acquisition Officer passed award dated 30.1.1993 whereby he held that the landowners are entitled to compensation of Rs.2,61,351.	Facts
On an application filed by the appellants under Section 18 of the Act, the Collector made reference to the concerned Court for determination of the compensation payable to the appellants.	None
On the pleadings of the parties, the Reference Court framed the following issues Whether compensation determined by the Land Acquisition Officer, Shivpuri, is insufficient and improper and contrary to the provisions of Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act?2.	Facts
Whether the petitioners are entitled to higher compensation?	Facts
If yes, to what extent?3.	None
Whether the application for reference made by the petitioners is within limitation?4.	None
Relief and costs.	None
In support of their claim, the appellants produced oral and documentary evidence including sale deeds marked Exhibits P3 to P26, the details of which (as given in the written note filed on behalf of the appellants on 27.11.2013) are as under Exhibit No.DateAREA (Sq Ft) Khasra No.TotalRATE(Rs.)	None

P2631.07.1992420?20 The Reference Court discarded most of the sale deeds on the ground that contents thereof have not been proved by examining the buyer and the seller and held that market value of the acquired land is Rs.7 per sq. ft.	None
The Reference Court then made 50 deduction for development of the acquired land, i.e., for construction of roads, drains, sewerage lines, parks, electricity lines, etc., and arranging other amenities and arrived at the figure of Rs.3.50 per sq. ft.	None
The Reference Court made further deduction to the tune of 50 on the ground that the land which was subject matter of sale deeds was very small and held that maximum cost of land cannot be more than Rs.1.75 per sq. ft. and awarded total compensation of Rs.8,87,485.55 to the appellants.	None
The Reference Court also determined separate shares of the appellants.	None
While dealing with the appellants claim for award of compensation in lieu of the damage caused due to removal of fencing of Sant Farm, segregation of land due to laying of rail line and construction of road, loss of earning due to damage of crops farming and destruction of well, the Reference Court did refer to the statement of PW1 Himmat Singh, certified copy of report Exhibit P32 prepared by SubDivisional Officer of the Water Resources Department as also the statement of Gaya Prasad Niranjan (DW1) but, without analyzing the same and without assigning cogent reasons, recorded the following conclusion In the aforesaid circumstances no amount on above counts can be determined on the basis of surmises and conjectures alone.	None
Moreover, it must also be kept in mind that this irrigation arrangement would have otherwise also become abrupt if the lands would have been used for building construction purposes and the buyer would have to make his own arrangements for stopping them.	None
In the circumstances there is no justification for determining any separate compensation on this count.	None
The appellants challenged the judgment of the Reference Court by filing appeal under Section 54 of the Act.	Facts
The learned Single Judge disposed of the appeal along with other appeals filed in relation to the land acquired for construction of Broad Gauge Rail Line and held As regards acquisition of land in the year 1991 is concerned, which is covered by second notification, the rate of land can be held to be Rs.8/ per sq. ft and after deduction I hold that they are entitled to Rs.	None
1.33/ per sq. ft.	None
i.e. after reduction of 50 towards development of roads, drainage etc. and 33.33 towards the expenses for development.	None
Considering this fact, I allow these appeals in part and hold that land which was required in the year 1987, the appellants are entitled to get compensation at the rate of Rs. 1/ per sq. ft and for the land, which was required in the year 1991, they are entitled to Rs.1.33/ per sq. ft.	None
The learned Single Judge of the High Court did not deal with the appellants claim for award of compensation in lieu of the loss caused due to removal of fencing of Sant Farm, segregation of land due to construction of road through the farm land and laying of rail line and loss of earning due to damage to crops and farming potential as also destruction of the well existing on the acquired land.	None
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and carefully perused the record.	None
By a separate judgment passed today in C.A. No.1247 of 2007, this Court has held that for the land acquired vide notification dated 28.5.1987 for construction of Broad Guage Rail Line, the appellants are entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.5 per sq.ft.	None
with all statutory benefits and interest on solatium.	None
Since the land which is subject matter of this appeal was acquired vide notification dated 27.12.1991 for construction of road from Kolaras Town to the Railway Station, we have no hesitation to hold that the appellants are entitled to the benefit of escalation in land prices.	None
In Ranjit Singh v. UT of Chandigarh (1992) 4 SCC 659 , Land Acquisition Officer v. Ramanjulu (2005) 9 SCC 594 , Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Bipin Kumar (2004) 2 SCC 283 , Sardar Jogendra Singh v. State of U.P. (2008) 17 SCC 133, Revenue Divisional OfficercumLAO v. Sk.	None
Azam Saheb (2009) 4 SCC 395 and ONGC Ltd. v. Rameshbhai Jivanbhai Pate (2008) 14 SCC 745 , this Court has repeatedly held that the exercise undertaken for fixing market value and determination of the compensation payable to the landowner should necessarily involve consideration of escalation in land prices.	None
In the last mentioned judgment, the Court noticed the earlier precedents and observed as under We have examined the facts of the three decisions relied on by the respondents.	None
They all related to acquisition of lands in urban or semiurban areas.	None
Ranjit Singh related to acquisition for development of Sector 41 of Chandigarh.	None
Ramanjulu related to acquisition of the third phase of an existing and established industrial estate in an urban area.	None
Bipin Kumar related to an acquisition of lands adjoining BadaunDelhi Highway in a semiurban area where building construction activity was going on all around the acquired lands.13.	None
Primarily, the increase in land prices depends on four factors situation of the land, nature of development in surrounding area, availability of land for development in the area, and the demand for land in the area.	None
In rural areas, unless there is any prospect of development in the vicinity, increase in prices would be slow, steady and gradual, without any sudden spurts or jumps.	None
On the other hand, in urban or semiurban areas, where the development is faster, where the demand for land is high and where there is construction activity all around, the escalation in market price is at a much higher rate, as compared to rural areas.	None
In some pockets in big cities, due to rapid development and high demand for land, the escalations in prices have touched even 30 to 50 or more per year, during the nineties.14.	None
On the other extreme, in remote rural areas where there was no chance of any development and hardly any buyers, the prices stagnated for years or rose marginally at a nominal rate of 1 or 2 per annum.	None
There is thus a significant difference in increases in market value of lands in urban semiurban areas and increases in market value of lands in the rural areas.	None
Therefore, if the increase in market value in urban semiurban areas is about 10 to 15 per annum, the corresponding increases in rural areas would at best be only around half of it, that is, about 5 to 7.5 per annum.	None
This rule of thumb refers to the general trend in the nineties, to be adopted in the absence of clear and specific evidence relating to increase in prices.	None
Where there are special reasons for applying a higher rate of increase, or any specific evidence relating to the actual increase in prices, then the increase to be applied would depend upon the same.15.	None
Normally, recourse is taken to the mode of determining the market value by providing appropriate escalation over the proved market value of nearby lands in previous years (as evidenced by sale transactions or acquisitions), where there is no evidence of any contemporaneous sale transactions or acquisitions of comparable lands in the neighbourhood.	None
The said method is reasonably safe where the reliedon sale transactions acquisitions precede the subject acquisition by only a few years, that is, up to four to five years.	None
Beyond that it may be unsafe, even if it relates to a neighbouring land.	None
What may be a reliable standard if the gap is of only a few years, may become unsafe and unreliable standard where the gap is larger.	None
For example, for determining the market value of a land acquired in 1992, adopting the annual increase method with reference to a sale or acquisition in 1970 or 1980 may have many pitfalls.	None
This is because, over the course of years, the rate of annual increase may itself undergo drastic change apart from the likelihood of occurrence of varying periods of stagnation in prices or sudden spurts in prices affecting the very standard of increase.	None
In view of the propositions laid down in the aforementioned judgments, we hold that the appellants will be entitled to 10 annual escalation in the compensation determined for the acquisition made vide notification dated 28.5.1987, which was published on 12.6.1987.	None
The appellants prayer for award of compensation on account of loss caused due to removal of fencing of Sant Farm, severance of land due to laying of rail line and construction of road, loss caused due to destruction of crop farming activity etc. was rejected by the Reference Court without assigning cogent reasons and the learned Single Judge of the High Court did not even deal with the issue.	None
It is, therefore, apposite that the matter is remitted to the Reference Court for deciding this issue afresh keeping in view the evidence produced by the parties in the references made by the Collector for determination of compensation of the land acquired vide notifications dated 28.5.1987 and 27.12.1991.	None
In the result, the appeal is partly allowed and it is declared that the appellants shall be entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs.5 per sq. ft. with benefit of escalation at the rate of 10 per annum for the period between 28.5.1987 and 27.12.1991.	Decision
The appellants shall also be entitled to get interest on solatium.	None
The respondents are directed to pay the enhanced compensation with interest etc. to the appellants within a period of six months from today.	Decision
The issue relating to award of compensation in lieu of the loss caused due to removal of fencing of Sant Farm, segregation of land on account of laying of rail line and construction of road from Kolaras Town to Railway Station and loss caused due to damage to the crop and farming activity is remitted to the Reference Court for fresh adjudication in the light of the evidence produced by the parties in the references made by the Collector under Section 18 of the Act.	None
