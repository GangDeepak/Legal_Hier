Thanking youYours faithfully, Sd  Umberto FontanellaHead of RegionAgusta Westland Report of the CAG Having failed to sign the contract by the due date, the Government floated (May 2007) a global tender for purchase of Agusta A 109 Power helicopter.	Arguments of Respondent
Out of the five bids received, the Cabinet approved (August 2007)	Arguments of Respondent
the bid of the same HongKong based dealer, who had offered to supply the helicopter earlier, and signed (October 2007) the agreement for US 65.70 lakh ( Rs. 25.96 crore as per prevailing exchange rates).	Arguments of Respondent
The supply of helicopter was received in December 2007 and payment of Rs. 25.96 crore was made.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, due to avoidable delay in taking decision on signing the contract by due date for purchase of new helicopter at the first instance, the Government had to purchase the same helicopter model from the same dealer at an extra cost of Rs. 65 lakh ( Rs. 25.96 crore Rs. 25.31 crore) as detailed in Appendix2.1	Arguments of Respondent
The objection on behalf of the petitioners is that in all the three offers, it was the same person who negotiated.	Arguments of Petitioner
Other helicopters were not considered.	Arguments of Petitioner
Excess price was paid to benefit the son of the Chief Minister.	Arguments of Petitioner
Question is whether the allegations are substantiated.	Issue
Even though the submission initially appeared to require consideration on account of which the State was directed to produce the record and explain the position after due consideration, we find it difficult to accept the same.13.	None
Son of the Chief Minister is not personally a party.	Reasoning
Disclosure in Panama Papers is a matter which is still under investigation by Multi Agency Group constituted by the Government of India on 4th April, 2016 which is to give its report to the Special Investigating Team constituted by this Court vide order dated 4th July, 2011 in Writ Petition (Civil)No.	Reasoning
176 of 2009 (This issue has been dealt with in the order of this Court dated 9th October, 2017 in W.P. No.65 of 2016).14.	Reasoning
On merits, as depicted in the comparative statement dated 19th December, 2006 signed by the Senior Helicopter Engineer and Chief Pilot (H), on comparison of A109 Power, B247 and EC135 T1, parameters of Delivery Schedule, Number of Aircrafts in India, Maintenance facility in India, Spares Inventory in India, Technical trained manpower, Engine Power, Engine Life, Operation, Maintenance and customer support and Operation at Night were in favour of A109 Power.	None
Letter dated 2nd January, 2007 addressed to the Director, Aviation, Government of Chhattisgarh shows that Agusta itself was not in a position to deliver the light twin engine helicopter before January, 2010.	Reasoning
However, it stated that the same could be secured in August September, 2007 from the distributors M s. Sharp Ocean Investments Limited, Hong Kong at a total amount of US 6,315,000.	Reasoning
Prior to this, on 29th December, 2016, recommendation was made by the Senior Engineer (H) that Agusta A109 was suitable for operation for State Government VIP operations.	Reasoning
Thus, for quick delivery, the State negotiated with M s. Sharp Ocean Investments Limited.	Reasoning
Final payment made is of 6,570,000 (Six million five hundred seventy thousand).	Reasoning
Contention that the price of the Helicopter was US 5,246,000 as shown by the invoice of the Agusta Westland dated 30th October, 2007 and thus, the remaining amount was by way of commission cannot be accepted in view of contents of the Agreement dated 9th October, 2007 and the correspondence.	Reasoning
The said agreement shows that Agusta had entered into agreement dated 24th May, 2006 for sale of Agusta Helicopter Model A109 to Serum Institute of India Limited.	Reasoning
The sale was assigned by the said Serum to Sharp and Sharp had made certain advance payments to Agusta.	Reasoning
Sharp had claimed its holding charges.	Reasoning
Agusta itself made it clear that the price was US 6 Million if delivery time was more.	Reasoning
For earlier delivery, presold Helicopter could be purchased from its distributor at a higher price.	Reasoning
Thus, it cannot be said that there was an excess payment for extraneous reason.	Reasoning
Comparison with the price at which Jharkhand proposed to purchase helicopter has no relevance as that was a deal in the year 2005 at which price the helicopter was not available at the relevant time as noted earlier.	Reasoning
Price in Jharkhand deal was US 5.591 million and the said transaction is dated 5th August, 2006.	Reasoning
Obviously, it is difficult to accept the contention that real value in the present transaction was US 5.246 million on 26th October, 2017 when the company itself vide letter dated 13th March, 2007 showed inability for early disposal and stated that the price was US 6.0 million if delivery period was more than two years.15.	Reasoning
It cannot be disputed that the State Government was entitled to make a choice to purchase the Helicopter in question.	Reasoning
There is nothing on record to show that the Helicopter could have been procured for lesser price.	Reasoning
No person claiming to give a better deal has come forward.	Reasoning
Thus, in absence of clear evidence that loss was caused to public exchequer by way of commission payment to Sharp Ocean Investments Limited which was only a route to send the payment to the son of the Chief Minister, interference by this Court is not called for.	Reasoning
There is a tripartite agreement dated 26th October, 2007, between Sharp Ocean Investments Limited, the State of Chhatisgarh and Agusta to the effect that Sharp Ocean Investments Limited was entitled to retain payment made by it to Agusta to the extent of US 100,000 (As per Article 4.1.A of Agreement dated 24th May, 2006 read with Agreement dated 13th November, 2006 in favour of Sharp Ocean Investments Limited) and US 1,473, 800 under Article 4.1.B of the Contract.	Reasoning
The CAG report does not attribute any extraneous consideration in the deal.16.	Reasoning
There is no material to prima facie hold that beneficiary of transaction was Abhishak Singh.	Reasoning
We do not consider it necessary to go into the allegation of mere procedural irregularities.	Reasoning
We broadly find that no case is made out for interference by this Court for issuing a direction as sought in absence of allegation of extraneous consideration being substantiated.17.	Reasoning
Having considered the merits, we need not go into the objection raised on behalf of the respondents that the petition was for political gains and should not be looked into in view of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, 1981 (Supp) SCC 87, Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary, (1992) 4 SCC 305 , Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lalan (VIII) v. Union of India, (2006) 6 SCC 613 , Ashok Kumar Pandey v.

State of U.P., 2012(4) R.C.R.(Criminal)	Reasoning
775 2012(5)	Reasoning
Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 360 (2013) 2 SCC 398 , Alagaapuram R. Mohanraj v. T.N. Legislative Assembly, 2016(2) R.C.R.(Civil) 87 2016(1)	Reasoning
Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 692 (2016) 6 SCC 82 and Santosh Singh v. Union of India, 2016(4) S.C.T. 1 (2016) 8 SCC 253.	Reasoning
There is no doubt about the legal position enunciated in the said decisions cautioning the Court against interference with decisions of the Executive without there being clear issue of genuine public interest.	Reasoning
However, they do not create a jurisdictional bar, if conscience of the Court is pricked in a given case.	Reasoning
A petition under Article 32, without clear element of public interest, cannot be entertained at the instance of a political rival merely on account of an alleged procedural irregularity in the decision making which can be challenged at appropriate forum by the aggrieved party.	Reasoning
Accordingly, we do not find any ground to grant prayer as sought in the petitions which hereby stand dismissed.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
