 K. Das, J.1.	None
The facts of this appeal have been stated by my learned brother Kapur, J, and as I am in agreement with him, I need not restate the facts.2.	None
The relevant assessment year was 19421943.	None
The proceedings under s. 34 of the Indian Incometax Act, 1922, were initiated with the issue of a notice on July 25, 1949.	None
The assessees contention was that the initiation of proceedings on July 25, 1949, was invalid as the departments right to revive the assessment was governed by old s. 34 where the period of limitation prescribed was only four years in the case of a failure to file a return and this period having expired on March 31, 1947, and the Amending Act of 1948 (XLVII of 1948) having come into force on March 30, 1948, the eight years provided period therein could not invoked.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court upheld this contention and said In our opinion, the contention of the learned counsel for the assessee is well founded, that the new rule of limitation of eight years prescribed by the amended section 34 would not apply to the case of the assessee before us, whose was an instance of a failure to submit a return, when the period of four years had ran out long before 30th March 1948 when the amended section 34 came into force as part of the Incometax Act with effect from that date, 30th March 1948.3.	None
The learned counsel for the Department next referred to section 31 of Act XXV of 1953 in support of his contention, that the notice issued on 25th July 1949 was valid.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel himself had to realise that section 31 of Act XXV of 1953 did not enlarge the scope of the amended section 34 nor did it purport to amend it.	Arguments of Respondent
The validity of the notice, dated 25th July 1949 will still have to be decided with reference to the provisions of the amended section 34.	None
Section 31 of Act XXV of 1953 does not therefore affect the question at issue, whether the extended period of limitation of eight years would apply to the assessee when the period of limitation applicable to the assessee had expired before the amended section 34 came into force on 30th March 1948.For the reasons given by me in S. C. Prashar, Incometax Officer v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas (1964) Vol. 1 S.C.R. 29.	None
(C.A. 705/1957) in which Judgment has been delivered today, I think that the High Court correctly answered the question referred to it.4.	None
I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.	None
KAPUR, J.5.	None
This is an appeal against the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras.	None
The appellant is the Commissioner of Incometax and the respondent is the assessee and the year of assessment is 194243.6.	None
The respondent is the wife of one Sheikh Abdul Khadar who was residing abroad in Bangkok from September 1940 to July 1947.	Facts
During that period he remitted moneys in the name of his agent for payment to the respondent.	Facts
In the account year the aggregate amount so remitted was Rs. 9, 180/.	Facts
The respondent submitted no return of her income as the was bound to do and the amount became taxable under s. 4(2) of the Incometax Act, hereinafter referred to as the Act.	Facts
In 1949 the Incometax Officer on receipt of definite information that such income had escaped assessment issued a notice under s. 34 of the Act as amended by the Amending Act of 1948 and an appeal was taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but the assessment was confirmed.	Facts
A further appeal to the Incometax Appellant Tribunal Madras, was also unsuccessful.	Facts
The reference was thereupon made to the High Court and one of the questions referred was Whether the proceedings under section 34 of the Indian Incometax Act initiated on 25th July, 1949 to assess the amount of Rs. 9, 180/ which escaped assessment during the year 194243 by failure to submit a voluntary return are valid in law ?	Facts
7.	None
It was held that the limitation of eight years prescribed by s. 34 as amended by the Amending Act of 1948 did not apply to the case of the assessee which was a case of failure to submit the return and the period of four years had expired before March 30, 1948, when the amendment in s. 34 was made by Amending Act of 1948.	None
It was also held that s. 31 of the Amending Act of 1953 was not applicable and the question was therefore answered in the negative.	Facts
Against that judgment and order the Commissioner of Incometax has come in appeal to this Court.	Facts
This case is governed by the decision in C.A. No. 705/57 (S. C. Prashar, Incometax Officer v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas) (1964)	None
Vol. 1 S.C.R. 29.	None
the judgment in which has been delivered today.	None
The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.	None
The appellant was granted the certificate by the High Court expressly on the condition that he would pay the costs of this appeal in any event to which he had agreed.	Reasoning
SARKAR, J.8.	None
The respondent in this appeal is the assessee.	None
She is the wife of one Sheikh Abdul Khadar who lived in Siam.	None
In the year 194142, she received from her husband from Siam a sum of Rs. 9, 180/.	None
It is not disputed that this amount constituted income in her hands within s. 4(2) of the Incometax Act, 1922.	None
She did not however submit any return in respect of it.	None
On July 25, 1949, a notice under s. 34 of the Act was issued to her asking her to file a return.	None
Thereafter she was assessed on the aforesaid income on October 24, 1949.	None
She appealed from that order but was unsuccessful in having the assessment set aside.	None
At her request, the Appellate Tribunal submitted the following question to the High Court at Madras for its decision Whether the proceedings under section 34 of the Indian Incometax Act initiated on 25th July 1949 to assess the amount of Rs. 9, 180/ which escaped assessment during the year 194243 by failure to submit a voluntary return are valid in law ?	Facts
9.	None
The High Court answered the question in the negative.	None
The revenue authorities have, therefore, come up in appeal.10.	None
Section 34 contains provisions for assessment and reassessment in cases where income for any years has not in the relevant assessment year been fully assessed for the reasons mentioned in it.	None
With these reasons it is not necessary to trouble ourselves in this appeal.	None
Subsection (1) of s. 34 deals with the period of time within which a notice calling for a return of the escaped income may be served and subs.	None
(3) deals with time within which the assessment can be made.	None
This section was amended by the Incometax and Business Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948.	None
This Act was passed on September 8, 1948 but the section which amended s. 34, of the Incometax Act was brought into force retrospectively from March 30, 1948.	None
In is not in dispute that under s. 34, as it stood before the amendment, the time to issue the notice calling for a return and to make the assessment in this case had expired on March 31, 1947, that is, on the expiry of four years after the year in which the escaped income was first assessable, namely, 194243.	None
It is not in dispute either that under s. 34, as it stood after the amendment in 1948, the notice could be served and an assessment made within eight years from the end of that year, that is, in this case, within March 31, 1951.	None
The notice and the assessment order impugned in this case have, therefore, to be held to be valid if s. 34 after its amendment in 1946 was applicable.	None
It is the contention of the appellant that it was so applicable.	None
The High Court held that the time having already expired under the existing law, the amended section 34 could not be given retrospective operation to validate the notice and the order of assessment.	None
Now, on May 24, 1953, was passed the Incometax (Amendment) Act, 1953, (XXV of 1953) which was brought into force retrospectively from April 1, 1952.	None
This Act contained a section, namely, s. 31, which to my mind makes s. 34 as amended by the 1948 amending Act, applicable to the proceedings in this case.	None
I am unable to accept the High Courts view to the contrary and regret my inability to comprehend the reasons on which that view is based.	None
That section also amended subs.	None
(3) of s. 34	None
so as to include in it provisions regarding the time of the issue of the notice but we will not be concerned with this amendment in this appeal.	None
Now, s. 31 is in these terms 11.	None
Section 31.	None
For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that the provisions of subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 34 of the principal Act shall apply and shall be deemed always to have applied to any assessment or reassessment for any year ending before the 1st day of April, 1948, in any case where proceedings in respect of such assessment or reassessment were commenced under the said subsections after the 8th day of September, 1948, and any notice issued in accordance with subsection (1) or any assessment completed in pursuance of such notice within the time specified in subsection (3), whether before or after the commencement of the Indian Incometax (Amendment) Act, 1953, shall, notwithstanding any judgment or order of any Court, Appellate Tribunal or Incometax authority to the contrary, be deemed to have been validly issued or completed, as the case may be, and no such notice, assessment or reassessment shall be called in question on the ground merely that the provisions of section 34 did not apply or purport to apply in respect of an assessment or reassessment for any year prior to the 1st day of April 1948.No question as to subs.	None
(2) of s. 34 mentioned in this section arises in this appeal and that subsection may be left out of consideration.12.	None
It seems to me quite plain that s. 31 of the 1953 Act applies subss.	Reasoning
(1) and (3) of s. 34 of the Incometax Act, 1922 (hereafter called the principal Act), as it stood after the 1948 amendment, to assessment proceedings in respect of years ending before April 1, 1948 where the proceedings commenced after September 8, 1948 and makes the validly of the proceedings depend on that section as so amended.	Reasoning
Indeed, the contrary has not been contended at the bar.	Reasoning
It has to be remembered that the amending Act of 1948 was passed on September 8, 1948 but it given retrospective effect from March 30, 1948.	Reasoning
It may be stated that the amending Act repealed the existing s. 34 of the principal Act and substituted for it a new section.	Reasoning
I think it is quite clear that the preexisting s. 34 which was repealed by the 1948 amendment could not have applied to proceedings commenced after repeal.	Reasoning
There was no question of applying the preexisting law to such proceedings.	Reasoning
But where the proceedings related to a period when the preexisting law was in force, there might be some doubt as to which law was to apply.	Reasoning
Section 31 was enacted to remove that doubt and to make s. 34 of the principal Act as it stood after the 1948 amendment applicable to these proceedings.	Reasoning
That is why the words shall always be deemed to have applied are used they emphasise that the amended section is deemed always to have applied to amendment had not been made.	Reasoning
The latter part of s. 31 also makes this view equally clear.	Reasoning
It says that no notice or order of assessment shall be called in question on the ground that s. 34 did not apply in respect of assessment for a year prior to April 1, 1948.	Reasoning
Section 34 here contemplated must be the section as amended in 1948, for if it was not so, then it would be the preexisting section which of course would have applied, if not repealed, to an assessment for a year ending prior to April 1, 1948 and no question of its not so applying would have arisen.	Reasoning
I thus arrive at the conclusion that under s. 31 of the 1953 Act, the provisions of subss.	Reasoning
(1) and (3)  I leave subs.	Reasoning
(2) out as irrelevant  of s. 34 of the principal Act as amended in 1948 are to be applied and deemed always to have applied to assessment proceedings in respect of a year ended before April 1, 1948 where the proceedings were commenced after September 8, 1948, A notice issued and an order of assessment made in such proceedings are to be held valid if the notice is issued in accordance with subsection (1) of s. 34 as it stood after the 1948 amendment and the assessment is completed in pursuance of such notice within the time specified in subsection (3) of the same s. 34.	Reasoning
Now the notice and assessment in the present case satisfy all these conditions.	Reasoning
To them, therefore, s. 34 as amended in 1948 applies.	Reasoning
Judged by that section, admittedly the notice and assessment order are unexceptionable.13.	None
It is true that in the present case when the notice was issued and the assessment made, the time to do either under the law as it stood before the 1948 amendment had expired.	None
It may be that law would have applied to it if the 1953 Act had not been passed.	None
It may also be, as was said in the Calcutta Discount Co. I.A.R. (1953)	None
Cal.	None
721 .	None
case, that by itself, the 1948 amendment of s. 34 would not have permitted assessment proceedings in respect of 194243 to be commenced in 1949 when under the previous law the time to issue a notice and to make an assessment for that year had expired before the 1948 amendment had come into force.	None
All this however is to no purpose.	None
No such question arises here.	None
The legislature had undoubtedly the power to make s. 34 as amended in 1948 apply to an assessment for 194243 by giving it a retrospective operation inspite of the time to issue a notice and to make an assessment fixed by the preexisting law having expired before the amendment came into effect.	None
The question really is one of interpretation, namely, whether the legislature had given such retrospective operation.	None
Now it seems to me that s. 31 of the 1953 Act clearly gives s. 34 of the principal Act as amended in 1948 such retrospective operation.	None
It plainly makes s. 34 as so amended applicable to assessments for years ended before the amendment came into force.	None
In does not say that s. 34 as amended is to apply to assessments for these years only when the time to issue the notice or make the assessment in respect of these years under the preexisting law had not expired.	None
It applied the amended s. 34 to any assessment for any year ending before the 1st day of April, 1948 in an case where proceedings were commenced after the 8th day of September 1948.	None
Likewise any notice and any assessment in respect of any year ending before April 1, 1948 is to be held valid, if valid under s. 34 as amended in 1948.	None
I find no justification in view of the language used to interpret s. 31 as applying s. 34 as amended in 1948 only to cases where the time to issue the notice and make the assessment had not expired while the preexisting law was in force.	None
The latter part of s. 31 seems to lead independently to the same conclusion.	None
It makes and notice issued in accordance with subsection (1) or any assessment completed in pursuance of such notice within the time specified in subsection (3) valid.	None
All that is necessary is that all notices and assessment orders in respect of years ending before April 1, 1948 in proceedings commenced after April 8, 1948 shall comply with the provisions of s. 34 as amended in 1948.	None
So a notice and an assessment order valid under s. 34 as amended in 1948 would be valid even if the time prescribed in respect of them by s. 34 as it stood before the 1948 amendment, had expired.14.	None
In my view, for these reasons, s. 34 of the principal Act as amended in 1948 applies to the notice issued and the assessment order made in this case.	Reasoning
Both of them are valid under s. 34 as so amended.	Reasoning
The High Court should have answered the question framed in the affirmative.	Reasoning
In the result, I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the High Court.	Reasoning
The appellant will however pay the respondents costs of this appeal as it agreed to do so as appears from the certificate on which this appeal has been admitted.	Reasoning
