KASLIWAL, J. Special Leave granted in all the petitions.	None
This litigation is an upshot of the earlier case Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Company Ltd. and Others, 1987 (1) SCC 424 decided on January 22, 1987.	Facts
In 1978 the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Banning) Act, 1978 (in short the Banning Act, was enacted to ban the promotion or conduct of prize chits or money circulation schemes and for matters connected therewith or incidental hereto.	Facts
The question which arose in the above case was whether the Endowment Scheme piloted by the Peerless General Finance and In vestment Company Ltd., (hereinafter in short the Peerless) fell within the definition of Prize Chits within the meaning of Sec.	Facts
2(e) of the above Banning Act.	Facts
By a letter dated July 23, 1979, the Reserve Bank of India pointed out to the Peerless that the schemes conducted by it were covered by the provisions of the Banning Act which had come into force w.e.f.	Facts
December 12, 1978.	Facts
On September 3, 1979 the Peerless filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court for a declaration that the Prize Chits Banning Act did not apply to the business carried on by the Peerless.	Facts
A similar writ petition was filed questioning a notice issued by the Madhya Pradesh Government on the same lines as that issued by the West Bengal Government.	Facts
A learned Single Judge of the High Court dismissed both the writ petitions but appeals preferred by the Peerless under the Letters Patent were allowed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court.	None
It was declared that the business carried on by the Peerless did not come within the mischief of the Prize Chits Banning Act.	None
Against the judgment of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court, the Reserve Bank of India, the Union of India and the State of West Bengal preferred appeals before this court.	Facts
The question considered in the above case was Is the endowment scheme of the Peerless Company a Prize Chit within the meaning of Section 2(e) of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act?	Facts
This court held that section 2(e) does not contemplate a scheme without a prize and, therefore, the Endowment Certificate Scheme of the Peerless Company was outside the Prize Chits Banning Act.	Facts
Appeals filed by the Reserve Bank of India, the Union of India and the State of West Bengal were accordingly dismissed.	Facts
Chinnappa Reddy, J. observed It is open to them to take such steps as are open to them in law to regulate schemes such as those run by the Peerless Company to prevent exploitation of ignorant subscribers.	Facts
Care must also be taken to protect the thousand of employees.	Facts
We must also record our dissatisfaction with some of the schemes of the Life Insurance Corporation which appear to us to be even less advantageous to the subscribers than the Peerless Scheme.	Facts
We suggest that there should be a complete ban on forfeiture clauses in all savings schemes, including Life Insurance Policies, since these clauses hit hardest the classes of people who need security and protection most.	Facts
We have explained this earlier and we do wonder whether the weaker sections of the people are not being made to pay the more affluent sections Robbing Peter to pay Paul?	Facts
It was further observed We would also like to query what action the Reserve Bank of India and the Union of India are taking or proposing to take against the mushroom growth of finance and investment companies offering staggeringly high rates of interest t o depositors leading us to suspect whether these companies are not speculative ventures floated to attract unwary and credulous investors and capture their savings.	Facts
One has only to look at the morning s newspaper to be greeted by advertisements inviting deposits and offering interest at astronomic rates.	Facts
On January 1, 1987 one of the national newspapers published from Hyderabad, where one of us happened to be spending the vacation, carried as many as ten advertisements with banner headlines covering the whole of the last page, a quarter of the first page and conspicuous spaces in other pages offering fabulous rates of interest.	Facts
At least two of the advertisers offered to double the deposit in 30 months, 2000 for 1000, 10, 000 for 5, 000, they said.	Facts
Another advertiser offered interest ranging between 30 per cent to 38 per cent for periods ranging between six months to five years.	Facts
Almost all the advertisers offered extra interest ranging between 3 per cent to 6 per cent if deposits were made during the ChristmasPongal season.	Facts
Several of them offered gifts and prizes.	Facts
If the Reserve Bank of India considers the Peerless Company with eight hundred crores invested in government securities, fixed deposits with National Banks etc. unsafe for depositors, one wonders what they have to say about the mushroom nonbanking campanies which are accepting deposits, promising most unlikely return and what action is proposed to be taken to protect the investors.	Facts
It does not require much imagination to realise the adventurous and precarious character of these business.	Facts
Urgent action appears to be called for to protect the public.	Facts
While on the one hand these schemes encourage two vices affecting public economy, the desire to make quick and easy money and the habit of excessive and wasteful consumer spending, on the other hand the investors who generally belong to the gullible and less affluent classes have no security whatsover.	Facts
Action appears imperative.	Facts
Khalid, J., another learned Judge aggreeing with the judgment of Chinnappa Reddy, J., further added his short but important concluding paragraph as under I share my brothers concern about the mushroom growth of financial companies all over the country.	Facts
Such companies have proliferated.	Facts
The victims of the schemes, that are attractively put forward in public media, are mostly middle class and lower middle class people.	Facts
Instances are legion where such needy people have bee n reduced penniless because of the fraud played by such financial vultures.	Facts
It is necessary for the authorities to evlove foolproof schemes to see that fraud is not allowed to be played upon persons who are not conversant with the practice of such financial enterprises who pose themselves as benefactors of people.	None
Taking note of the weighty observations made by this Court, the Reserve Bank of India in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 45 (J) and 45 (K) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and of all the powers enabling it in this behalf and considering it necessary in the public interest issued certain directions by notification No. DFC.55/DG(O)87 dated the 15th May, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as the directions of 1987).	None
The constitutional validity of these directions of 1987 was challenged by Timex Finance and Investment Company Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Timex Company) by filing a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court before the learned Single Judge.	Facts
The learned Single Judge granted an interim order in terms of prayers (g) and (h) of the writ petition.	None
The Reserve Bank of India aggrieved against the interim order filed an appeal before the Division Bench.	None
A stay petition was also moved on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India for staying t	Facts
he operation of the order dated 7th October, 1988 passed by the learned Single Judge.	Facts
After hearing the stay petition for sometime, the Division Bench of the High Court listed the appeal as well as the stay petition for final disposal.	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court disposed of the appeal as well as the writ petition by an order dated March 23, 1990 and arrived to the following and conclusions.	None
Reserve Bank of India is empowered to issue directions to the residuary nonbanking companies under the provisions of Section 45J and 45K of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 for the interest of thousands of depositors.(b)	Facts
However, to the extent such directions are found to be prohibitory or not workable and as such unreasonable must be held to be beyond the powers of the Reserve Bank of India.(c)	Facts
The impugned directions providing that they represent irreducible minimum for safeguarding the interest of and for preventing exploitation of small and unwary depositors cannot be implemented without suitable modification.	Facts
It is not reasonably practicable to comply strictly with the directions as they stand by the writ petitioners and the similarly situated companies.	Facts
The Supreme Court in Peerless case (Supra)reserved the liberty to the Reserve Bank of India to take such steps as are open to them in law to regulate the schemes such as those granted by the Peerless to prevent exploitation of subscribers and to protect thousands of employees.	Facts
The impugned directions without modifications will run counter to the aforesaid directions of the Supreme Court.(d)	Facts
The business of savings and investments carried on by the company and similarly situated companies having not been declared unlawful or banned, power of the Reserve Bank of India to regulate such business cannot be permitted to be prohibitory resulting in the ultimate closure of the business carried on by the writ petitioner company and other similarly situated companies.	Facts
If the modifications as suggested by us are not implemented and if ultimately the business is closed down and the company goes into liquidation, the hard earned money of thousands of depositors will be lost and the employees would also lose their job.	Facts
If even after modifications are made to the impugned directions in terms of this order, any company fails to comply with such directions, the Government may take such steps as are open to them to protect the interests of the thousands of small depositors and numerous employees .(e)	Facts
The reasons why the impugned directions cannot be complied with and held to be unworkable and unreasonable are mainly because of the definition of liability assigned in the impugned directions.	Facts
The impugned directions, as they stand now, cannot be implemented by the residuary nonbanking companies without incurring loss irrespective of their networth.	Facts
According to the impugned directions, the liability is the amount of money deposited by the depositions plus the amount of interest whether or not due to them according to the terms of the respective contracts at the given point of time.	Facts
In ot her words, the entire collection with the interest, Bonus, etc. whether payable or not would be the liability of the Company.	Facts
This leaves no fund for working.	Facts
If the definition of liability is amended as suggested by us, it will be possible for the companies to generate working capital.	Facts
In our view, liability in clause 6 and in other clauses of the impugned directions should be construed to mean total amount of contractual dues of the depositors including interest, premium, bonus or other advantages by whatever name called, accrued on the amount according to the terms of contract.	Facts
Section 45J and 45K of the Act do not authorise the Reserve Bank of India to introduce a concept of liability which is contrary to the accepted commercial practice and trading principles.	Facts
The impugned directions have failed to make distinction between the actual liability in presenti and a liability de futuro.	Facts
Liberty must be reserved to the companies to adopt normal accountancy practice recognised and accepted in the trading circles so long as such accounting practice provides for payment of the liability to the depositors in accordance with the contractual obligations.	Facts
However, the Reserve Bank of India may, having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case issue directions regulating the administrative and management expenses and expenditure on commission and publicity.	Facts
In the impugned directions no restriction has been imposed on the expenditure by a residuary nonbanking company on any of these heads.	Facts
In our view, the impugned directions without modifications, instead of suppressing the mischief, will only lead to adverse unworkable and or impracticable results inasmuch as if the residuary nonbanking companies cannot comply with such directions in toto, such companies have to go out of existence.	Facts
This cannot be the object of the impugned directions.	Facts
If the liability in terms of the contractual obligations is provided not only in the accounts but also by suitable investment in terms of Clause 6 of the directions, in our view, all the residuary nonbanking companies, irrespective of their net worth, will be able to carry on the business.(f)	Facts
Every residuary nonbanking company shall disclose its Books of Accounts and balance sheet the aggregate amount of liability accrued and payable to the depositors in accordance with the terms of the contract.(g )	Facts
The directions contained in clause 6 for deposit or investment and the liability shall be read subject to the modification of the designation of the liability as aforesaid.(h)	Facts
The directions are prospective.	Facts
T he period of deposit and the date of return with respect to all certificates issued prior to 15th May 1987 have been excluded from the purview of the directions as per clause 18 (1).	Facts
This exemption should include all contractual obligations on those certificates.(i) All funds prior to the issue of the directions should be allowed to be kept in the manner as was being done by the respective residuary nonbanking company.	Facts
The direction with regard to the investment shall be applicable from the money collected and or received on and after 15th May 1987.	Facts
The companies shall be allowed reasonable time to make good the deficiency in the investment required to be made in terms of the directions after 15th May 1987.(j)	Facts
We are not unmindful of the fact that exercise of power by legislature and executive is subject to judicial restraint.	Facts
The only check on judicial exercise of power is the selfimposed dicipline of judicial restraint.	Facts
But although the courts in exercise of judicial power are not competent to direct the enactment of a particular provision of law, if the statutory directions suffer from arbitrariness, the court is competent to issue necessary direction so that the statutory directions may be brought in conformity with law.	Facts
As we have held that the Reserve Bank of India has transgressed the statutory power to the extent indicated elsewhere in the judgment, we are of the view that the Reserve Bank of India shall modify the directions and make them reasonable and workable to safeguard the interest of depositors and protect the employees.	None
The Division Bench also considered an application filed by Favourite Small Investment Company and by order dated 20th December, 1990 directed that the Reserve Bank of India should revoke the prohibitory order and permit Favourite Small Investment Company to accept fresh deposits and carry on new business.	None
It may be noted that the Peerless filed a petition before the High Court for becoming a partyrespondent.	None
The High Court by order dated 31st August, 1990 allowed the said application and further ordered that the cause title and the records proceedings of appeal, memorandum of appeal and the paper book filed be amended accordingly.	Facts
The Peerless also moved an application for clarification of the judgment and order dated 23rd March, 1990.	Facts
It prayed that suitable provision should be made for a depositor who wants back the money before maturity.	Facts
If the depositor intends to get refund of the money invested before the expiry of actual contract period, he should be required to keep the funds for a minimum period in accordance with the contract.	Facts
Before maturity he can only take loan but not the principle amount with interest.	Facts
The amounts of returns should also be less than 5 per cent to provide for the collection and other expenses of the nonbanking companies.	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court took the view that the order dated 23rd March, 1990 required clarification as it was not made clear as to whether nonresiduary banking companies are under an obligation to pay discontinued certificates before the stipulated period in the contract, if so what would be the rate of interest.	Facts
The Division Bench by order dated December 24, 1990 clarified its earlier order dated 23rd March, 1990 as under If the contract by and between the company and the depositor provides that no payment on discontinued certificate will be made before the expiry of the term stipulated in the contract, in such cases, if the certificate is discontinued any time before such stipulated term and payment is made to the depositors according to the terms and conditions of the contract, in other words, on the expiry of the term stipulated in the con tract, such depositor shall be paid interest at the rate of 8 compound per annum, but in such a case the company w ill be at liberty to deduct an amount not exceeding 5 from the total return in or to provide for collection and other expenses incurred in connection with these discontinued certificates(b) In cases where certificates are discontinued before or after the stipulated term but the depositors obtain refund only upon maturity of the certificates such refund shall be made to depositors with compound interest at the rate 8 per annum without any deduction whatsoever.(c)	Facts
Since no payment will be made against the discontinued certificates to the depositors in such cases shall be permitted to take loan, if they so intend, against the payment made till discontinuance of such terms and conditions as the company may stipulate.	None
The Reserve bank of India aggrieved against all the above orders of the Calcutta High Court has filed appeals against the orders dated 23 rd March, 1990.	None
31st August, 1990, 20th December, 1990 and 24th December, 1990.	Facts
The Peerless General Finance and Investment Company Ltd., has also filed a writ petition No. 677 of 1991 directly before this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.	Facts
In view of the fact that the questions raised in the appeals filed by the Reserve Bank of India against the orders of the High Court and in the civil writ petition filed by the Peerless Company are common, the same were heard together and are disposed of by a single order.	None
Interlocutory applications were also filed on behalf of the employees of the Peerless Company, agents of Peerless Company working in the field, and some of the depositors in the Peerless company.	None
We have heard them also.	None
The main controversy centers round paragraphs (6) and (12) of the directions of 1987 and as such the same are reproduced in full.	None
Paragraph (6) Security for depositors On and from 15th May 1987 (1) Every residuary nonbanking company shall deposit and keep deposited in fixed deposits with public sector banks or invest and keep invested in unencumbered approved securities (Such securities being valued at their marked value for the time being), or in other investments, which in the opinion of the company are safe, a sum which shall not, at the close of business on 31st December 1987 and thereafter at the end of each half year that is, 30th June and 31st December be less than the aggregate amounts of the liabilities to the depositors whether or not such amounts have become payableProvided that of the sum so deposited or invested (a) not less than ten percent shall be in fixed deposits with any of the public sector banks.	None

None
Explanation Net owned funds shall mean the aggregate of the paidup capital and free reserves as appearing in the latest audited balance sheet of the company as reduced by the amount of accumulated balance of loss, deferred revenue expenditure and other intangible assets, if any, as disclosed in the said balance sheet(2)	None
Every residuary nonbanking company shall entrust to one of the public sector banks designated in that behalf, deposits and securities referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to subparagraph (1) to be held by such designated bank for the benefit of the depositors.	None
Such securities and deposits shall not be withdrawn by the residuary nonbanking company, or otherwise dealt with, except for repayment to the depositors.(3)	None
Every residuary nonbanking company shall furnish to the Reserve Bank within thirty days from the close of business on 31st December 1987 and thereafter at the end of each half year t hat is as on 30th June and 31st December, a certificate from its auditiors, being members of Institute of Chartered Accountants, to the effect that the amounts deposited in fixed deposits and the investments made are not less than the aggregate amounts of liabilities to the depositors as on 30th June and 31st December of that year.	None

None
Paragraph (12) Every residuary nonbanking company shall disclose as liabilities in its books of accounts and balance sheets the total amount of deposits received together with interest, bonus, premium or other advantage, accrued or payable to the depositors.	Facts
We would first deal with the legal objections raised on behalf of the Peerless and other companies.	None
It has been submitted on behalf of the Peerless and other companies that the directions of 1987 are ultra vires of Section 45J and 45K of the Reseve Bank of India Act, 1934.	Arguments of Petitioner
None of the said sections authorises the Reserve Bank to frame any directions prescribing the manner of investment of deposits received or the method of accountancy to be followed or the manner in which its balanceshe et and books of accounts are to be drawn up.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been contended that Section 45J has no manner of application in the present case.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 45K (3) of the Act on which reliance has been placed on behalf of the Reserve Bank, merely provides t hat the Reserve Bank may, if it considers necessary in the public interest so to do, give directions to nonbanking institutions either generally or to any nonbanking institutions in particular, in respect of any matters relating to or connected with receipts of deposits, including the rate of interest payable on such deposits and the purpose for which deposits will be received.	Arguments of Petitioner
According so Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45K (4) if any nonbanking institution fails to comply with any direction given by the bank under subs.	Arguments of Petitioner
(3) the Reserve Bank may prohibit the acceptance of deposits by that nonbanking institution.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is thus submitted that on a plain reading of Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45K (3) the Reserve Bank is only competent to frame the directions regarding receipt of deposits and such power of direction does not extend to providing the manner in which deposits can be invested or the manner in which the liabilities are to be disclosed in the balancesheet or books of accounts of the company.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that the power under subs.	Arguments of Petitioner
(4) is to prohibit acceptance of deposits and as such the permissible field of direction making is limited to receipt of deposits and nothing more.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Reserve Bank of India in framing the directions of 1987 which is a subordinate piece of legislation has clearly overstepped the bounds of the parent statue of Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45K (3) of the Act.	Reasoning
It is further argued that t he Reserve bank cannot contend that paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987 are covered within the powers conferred on the Reserve Bank under Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45L (1) (b) of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the Reserve Bank had at no point of time expressed its intention to invoke its powers under Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45L. Even before the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court the Reserve Bank did not rely on Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45L as alleged source of its power to issue the impugned directions nor the Reserve Ban k referred to Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45L in its pleadings before the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Wherever the Reserve Bank of India wanted to invoke its power under Sec 45L of the Act, it has expressly mentioned that it was exercising its powers under Sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45L.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the case of nonbanking financial companies (Reserve Bank) directions 1977, or the miscellaneous nonbanking companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1977 it has expressly said that it was invoking its powers under sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45L of the Act, whereas in the case of the impugned directions, the Reserve Bank has only referred to sections 45J and 45K of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Reserve Bank of India itself in the affidavit filed before the High Court had stated that the directions of 1987 were framed after careful deliberations at the highest level and now it cannot take the stand that the source of its power in framing the impugned directions was exercised under sec 45L of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further contended that in order to invoke the powers under sec 45L of the Act it has to state that the Reserve Bank was satisfied for the purpose of enabling it to regulate the credit system of the country to its advantage and it was necessary to give such institutions directions relating to the conduct of business by financial institution or institutions.	Arguments of Petitioner
In order to exercise its powers under sec.	Arguments of Petitioner
45L of the Act, it has to apply its mind for the purpose of arriving at the statutorily required satisfaction.	Arguments of Petitioner
In fact, such recital is necessary since such satisfaction is a preconditions for the Reserve Bank to exercise its powers under section 45L of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand it has been contended on behalf of the Reserve Bank that the power of the Reserve Bank to regulate deposit acceptance activities of nonbanking and financial institutions under Chapter IIIB of the Act cannot be disputed.	Arguments of Respondent
The Reserve Bank has power to issue the impugned directions under Section 45J, 45K and 45L of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The pith and substance of Para 6 of the directions of 1987 is to ensure that deposits received from the public are invested in a manner to secure the repayment of the deposits.	Arguments of Respondent
A deposit is, by definition, a sum of money received with a corresponding obligation to repay the same.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, the repayment of the deposit is an integral part of the transaction of a receipt of deposit.	Arguments of Respondent
It is contended that the expression receipt of deposit must be construed liberally, in the light of the nature of the provisions as well as in the light of the wide language used in the provision.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also argued that even if the impugned directions of 1987 are not covered under the powers conferred under Sections 45J and 45K of the Act, those are squarely covered by Section 45L of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that various provisions under the Act are enabling in nature and confer overlapping powers.	Arguments of Respondent
Even if there is no recital of Sec.	Arguments of Respondent
45L, it woul d not be of much consequence, if such exercise of power can be related to Sec.	Arguments of Respondent
45L of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties.	None
Chapter IIIB laying down provisions relating to nonbanking institutions receiving deposits and financial institutions was inserted in the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, by virtue of Act 55 of 1963 w.e.f. 1.2.1964.	None
Section 45J, 45K (3) (4) and 45L 1	None
(b) relevant for our purpose are given as under Sec.	None
45J	None
The Bank may, if it considers necessary in the public interest so to do, by general or special order, (a) regulate or prohibit the issue by any non banking institution of any prospectus or advertisement soliciting deposits of money from the public and(b) specify the conditions subject to which any such prospectus or advertisement, if not prohibited, may be issued.	None
Section 45K(1)	None
(2) (3) The Bank may, if it considers necessary in the public interest so to do, give direction to nonbanking institutions either generally or to any nonbanking institution or group of nonbanking institutions in particular, in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits, including the rates of interest payable on such deposits, and the periods for which deposits may be received.(4) If any nonbanking institution fails to comply with any direction given by the Bank under subsection (3), the Bank may prohibit the acceptance of deposits by that non banking institution.	None
Section 45L (1) If the bank is satisfied that for the purpose of enabling it to regulate the credit system of the country to its advantage it is necessary so to do it may (a) (b) give to such institutions either generally or to any such institution in particular, directions relating to the conduct of business by them or by it as financial institutions or institution.	Arguments of Petitioner
A combined reading of the above provisions unmistakably goes to show that t he Reserve Bank if considers necessary in the public interest so to do can specify the conditions subject to which any prospectus or advertisement soliciting deposits of money from the public may be issued.	Reasoning
It can also give directions to nonban king institutions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits, including the rates of interest payable on such deposits, and the periods for which deposits may be received.	Reasoning
This latter power flows from subs.	Reasoning
(3) of Sec.	Reasoning
45K of the Act.	Reasoning
The Bank under this provision can give directions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits (emphasis added).	Reasoning
In our view a very wide power is given to the Reserve Ban k of India to issue directions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits.	Reasoning
It cannot be considered as a power restricted or limited to receipt of deposits as sought to be argued on behalf of the companies that under this power the Reserve Bank would only be competent to stipulate that deposits cannot be received beyond a certain limit or that the receipt of deposits may be linked with the capital of the company.	Reasoning
Such interpretation would be violating the language of Sec.	Reasoning
45K (3) which furnishes a wide power to the Reserve Bank to give any directions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits.	Reasoning
The Reserve Bank under this provision is entitled to give directions with regard to the manner in which the deposits are to be invested and also the manner in which such deposits are to be disclosed in the balancesheet or books of accounts of the company.	Reasoning
The word any qualifying matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits in the above provision is of great significance and in our view the impugned directions of 1987 are fully covered under Sec.	Reasoning
45 K (3) of the Act, which gives power to the Reserve Bank to issue such directions.	Reasoning
As a proposition of law we agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the Reserve Bank that when an authority takes action which is within its competence, it cannot be held to be invalid merely because it purports to be made under a wrong provision, if it can be shown to be within its power under any other provision.	Reasoning
Learned counsel in this regard has placed reliance on Indian Aluminium Company etc.	Reasoning
v. Kerala State Electricity Board, 1976 (1) SCR 70.	None
In our view as already held above, the Reserve Bank was competent and authorised to issue the impugned directions of 1987, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 45K (3) of the Act.	None
Having cleared the ground of ultra vires we must now turn to the main challenge posed on behalf on the Peerless and other companies and employees.	None
Mr. Harish Salve made the leading arguments on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India .	Arguments of Respondent
His main thrust of the argument was that the Reserve Bank of India had issued these directions of 1987 in order to carry out observations made by this Court in Peerless case (supra) and in the public interest of safeguarding the money of the depositors in such companies.	Arguments of Respondent
The Reserve Bank considered it necessary that the interest of millions of small depositors of rural areas should be made safe and may not be devoured by a mushroom of companies with no stake.	Arguments of Respondent
According to Mr. Salve it was not the intention of the Reserve Bank to put any restrictions in the manner or conduct of business to be done by such companies.	Arguments of Respondent
But the most important factor weighing in the mind of the Reserve Bank was to safeguard the money of the deposi tors.	Arguments of Respondent
It was not the concern of the Reserve Bank as to how and in what manner these companies would regulate their expenses or would be able to conduct such business for earning more profits.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Reserve Bank of India these companies cannot be allowed to spend a mighty of deposits for meeting their own expenses.	Arguments of Respondent
They should find out their own resources for meeting the expenses.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Reserve Bank the rate of interest to be paid by these companies to the depositors h as been fixed as 10 per cent per annum.	Arguments of Respondent
They could easily invest such amount in bonds issued by public sector corporation and earn interest at the rate of 14 per cent per annum or more and thereby earn a profit of 4 per cent and regulate their ex penses within the limits of such profits.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that the propensity of the problem has increased manifold in view of the fact that the amount of deposits and investments ha s gone to staggering heights worth several thousand crores of lower middle class persons living mostly in the rural areas.	Arguments of Respondent
A bogey of employment hazards of several thousand regular employees and still a large number of agents working in the fie ld cannot deter the Reserve Bank to lay down some directions which may act harshly and resulting in lessening of profits of such companies.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also submitted that according to the affidavit submitted before this Honble Court on behalf of t he Reserve Bank of India it has been stated that prior to 1987 directions, there were 747 such companies which were conducting deposit scheme.	Arguments of Respondent
At present they could classify only 392 such companies as required information for classifying of the remaining companies had not been received.	Arguments of Respondent
Most of such companies have not designated their banks as it required under paragraph (6) of the directions and in most of such cases amounts invested in bank deposits and approved securitie s fall much short of deposit liabilities.	Arguments of Respondent
The companies operating in these areas also at times become untraceable in that a number of show cause notices issued have been returned as addressee not known etc.	Arguments of Respondent
In some cases those who have chosen to reply have given evasive replies.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been further stated in the affidavit that most of these companies did not comply with the financial discipline sought to be imposed upon them and have avoided and abhorred any scrutiny into their accounts.	None
It has thus been submitted that to get over these difficulties, the directions of 1987 attempt to provide a steady, stable identificable and monitorable method by which the companies will be able to disclose all their true liabilities and also utilise the money raised from the depositors for investment in safe indentifiable and quantifiable securities instead of investing them in other ventures.	Arguments of Respondent
This will ensure complete security to the depositors a t all times and will also make the accounts of the companies comprehensible and easy to monitor.	Arguments of Respondent
As regards the formula laid down by the High Court it has been submitted that if a variable as against a fixed and definite percentage of investment with respect to amounts collected by way of each instalment is permitted it would be impossible to find out and verify whether the amounts invested are in accordance with the directions at any given point of time when there are thousand s of certificates with different and varying maturity periods.	Arguments of Respondent
In the circumstances, the formula laid down by the High Court is selfdefeating and also deprives the depositor of the security envisaged under the directions.	None
It was also submitted on behalf of the Reserve Bank that it is an admitted position that the business of RNBCs is to collect funds from the public and invest the same in Government securities and bank deposits.	None
In the application forms and in the advertisements issued by these companies it is expressly held out to the public that their moneys are safe with the banks and in Government securities.	Reasoning
It is the very nature of their business which makes it nonviable if they are to give fair return to the depositors and private security for the repayment of their money.	Reasoning
The scheme of control as provided in the directions of 1987 might be harsh but the same is in conformity with t he assertions held out by these companies to the public at large.	Reasoning
These directions subject the companies to proper discipline by monitoring their actions and such directions cannot be considered as unreasonable.	Reasoning
The reasonableness of the direction s when looked at from the point of view of the depositors for whose safeguard they have been issued, is beyond question.	Reasoning
Return provided and the security to be given through proper investment cannot be faulted on any ground.	Reasoning
Thus what seems to be an impossible situation for these companies is not due to the impugned directions but because of the nature of business itself.	Reasoning
The funds are collected at exhorbitant costs and on that account it becomes difficult for the companies to give a fair return to the depositors.	Reasoning
These companies are not genuine investment companies.	Reasoning
If they want to do genuine investment business they can do so by choosing freely their investment, but in that case Reserve Bank of India directions applicable to such companies would permit them to accept deposits not exceeding 25 per cent of paid up capital and reserve.	Reasoning
The directions of 1987 had not imposed any restriction on the right to carry on business but those directions only place a restriction with respect to one of the modes of raising reserves i.e. through public deposits.	Reasoning
It has been further argued that the reasonableness of the directions has not to be looked into from the point of view of the company to whom any such restrictions will be irksome and may therefore be regarded as unreasonable.	None
The framing of the directions are only regulatory in nature keeping in view the interest of the depositors without unduly jeopardising the interest of the employees.	Reasoning
Keeping this in mind it has been provided that the minimum return would be at 10 per cent, though there are govt.	Reasoning
and public sector bonds which pay interest at a much higher rate.	Reasoning
Even presently bank deposits and other company deposits give return varying between 13 to 15 per cent.	Reasoning
There is no limitation on the quantum of deposits with reference to the overall capital as shown in the case of companies governed by the Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules 1975, Non Banking Financial Companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1977.	Reasoning
The linking of deposits with capital as in the case of other regulations is a measure to secure the interest of the depositors namely e.g. Companies (Acceptance of Deposit) Rules, 1975, ensure t hat the assets are at least three times the deposits received.	None
In view of the low or total nonexistent capital of the RNBCs, it was not possible to secure the deposits in this manner.	None
Instead, it has been provided that the entire liability towards the depositors should be invested and no part of the deposits be utilised for payment of commission etc. or incurring other expense.	Reasoning
In any event, even if, the directions do not prescribe existence of owners capital as security, it does not imply that it is permissible to use the deposits received to bridge the time gap between income and expenditure.	Reasoning
Merely because the directions do not fix a ceiling on the rate of commissions it does not imply that the Reserve Bank has granted its permission to payment of high commission or incurring of large expenses on management etc.	Reasoning
The RNBCs are free to incur such expenses and organize their business as they desire as long as the depositors are fully secured at all times.	Reasoning
The contention that the business of the RNBCs will close down if the directions of 1987 are to be adhered to is not based on facts and misconceived in law.	Reasoning
A perusal of Directors Report of Peerless for the years 1988, 1989 and 1990 clearly go to show that they did not consider the company in any financial difficulty and in fact paid larger dividends even after complying with the impugned directions of 1987.	Reasoning
It has thus been submitted that given a wide latitude in judging the validity of economic legislation on the touch stone of reasonableness, in the absence of patent arbitrariness but having nexus with the public objective sought to be attained, the durations cannot be condemned as being violative of Article 19(1) (g).	None
The result of the contentions put forward on behalf of RNBCs would be that in the case of endowments repayable after, say 10 years, there will be nothing due and payable in the first nine years and as such there would be no need of investing any sums for the first nine years.	Arguments of Respondent
The interpretation placed by the respondent companies upon the judgment of the High Court is that it is now open to them to determine as per their own peculiar estimate, what would be sufficient to meet the liabilities towards the deposits and accordingly such amount would be their aggregate liability.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the Peerless Company if it deposits 75 per cent of the first years subscription, it is adequate to cover its liabilities to the depositors.	Arguments of Respondent
On the other hand as per Timex Company a deposit of only 50 per cent of the first years subscription would be adequate to cover its liabilities to the depositos.	Arguments of Respondent
Whereas the Favourite Company contends that investment of 40 per cent of the first years subscription will be adequate to cover the liabilities to the depositors.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been submitted that according to well accepted accounting practice where any sum is received as a loan or as a deposit it has to be shown as a liability together with accrued interest irrespective of when it is due.	None
The amount contributed by the depositors being a capital receipt and not a revenue receipt cannot under any circumstances be shown in the balance sheet otherwise then at its full value.	Arguments of Respondent
Moreover, being a capital receipt, it cannot be credited to the profit and loss accounts since Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956 requires that the amounts to be shown in the profit and loss accounts should be confined to the income and expenditure of the company.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, crediting a part of the first and subsequent years deposit instalments to the profit and loss account and not showing them fully as a liability in the balance sheet would be a contravention of the provisions of the Companies Act.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been further submitted on behalf of the Reserve Bank that the quest ion which arises for consideration is whether liability to the depositors can be calculated on an actuarial basis.	None
It may be noted that actuarial basis is normally adopted (a) in respect of items of income and expenditure, (b) where there is a significant element of uncertainty.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, in so far as the liability arising out of the repayment to the depositors of the amount capitalised by him is considered, the actuarial basis cannot be adopted and this liability must always be stated at its full value.	Arguments of Respondent
The principle of actuarial valuation is in opposite for the business of RNBCs.	None
It has also been submitted that the formula laid down by the High Court about the quantum of investments to be made by RNBCs is incapable of effectively monitoring and hence the provisions made in the directions of 1987 regarding security to depositors would be rendered wholly illusory.	None
Such impossibility in the monitoring has been demonstrated as follows These companies do not fix a definite but variable percentage of investment with respect to amounts collected by way of each instalment under the certificates of deposits e.g. Peerless would invest 75 of the collections made out of 1st instalment (retaining and taking to P L A c, 25 ) and 82 out of 2nd instalment and so on.	None
At any given point of time, there will be thousands of deposit certificates with varying maturity and the amounts collected would be an impossibility to find out and verify whether the amounts invested are in accordance, with the proportion fixed by the companies with respect to each instalment.	None
Regulatory authority would have to depend entirely on these companies for doing its monitoring exercise.(B)	None
Each company fixes its own proportion of investment with respect to each instalment based on the projected yield from its investment e.g. Favourite Finance Company claims that it needed to invest only 40 of the amounts collected by way of 1st instalment claiming that the projected yield from its investment would be 14.8 .	None
This would compound the impossibility of monitoring further.	None
It has thus been argued that the formula laid down by the High court is selfdefeating an d depriving altogether benefits of security provisions given to depositors under the directions of 1987.	None
Mr. Somnat Chatterjee, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Peerless Company contended that the Peerless being the largest RNBC in india having an impeccable record of public service decided to give effect to the directions of 1987 as it wanted to avoid any confrontation with Reserve Bank and further not to give an impression of seeking to avoid regulatory control, tried its best to comply with the said directions w.e.f.	Arguments of Petitioner
15th May, 1987 till 31st March, 1989.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, from its working results it appeared bonafide to the Board of Directors of Peerless that it was impossible to carry on its traditional business for any longer period without incurring huge losses.	Arguments of Petitioner
The company as such decided to approach the High Court for obtaining the benefit of judgment delivered in the Timex case.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Peerless has only challenged a part of Paragraph 6 of the directions of 1987 and the consequential direction contained in para 12 which shows that Peerless does not wish to remain outside of the regulatory controls of Reserve Bank but challenges only those directions which make the business totally un workable.	Arguments of Petitioner
There has been no attempt on the part of Peerless to carry on its business in a manner which may jeopardize the interest of any depositor or which will not protect fully every paisa deposited with Peerless at all points of time.	Arguments of Petitioner
No rea l complaint was made by or on behalf of Reserve Bank as to any depositor of Peerless running a risk of loss of any amount or that it has carried on or is carrying on the business in an undesirable manner.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been submitted that Peerless should not be made to suffer for the illegality or improprieties, if any committed by any other RNBC and neither Peerless nor its 14 lac field agents, 3 thousand field officers and 4 thousand direct employees should be made to suffer.	Arguments of Petitioner
The result o f following directions of 1987 would be that all the above agents, officers and employees of the Peerless could loose their jobs and their family members will be thrown on the streets.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Peerless had abolished the provision of forfeiture i n all its schemes as early as in 1986 that is even prior to coming into force of the directions of 1987.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Peerless has been compelled to challenge paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987 since enforcement of these provisions would result in complete annihilation of the undertaking of Peerless in the near future.	None
It was further contended that it is inherent in the business carried on by Peerless and other similar RNBCs that the working capital is generated out of the subscri ptions received from the certificate holders.	None
Such business comprises in collecting subscriptions from depositors either in lumpsum or in instalments and such deposits are paid back with the guaranteed accretions, bonus, interest etc.	Arguments of Petitioner
in terms of the contract at the end of the stipulated term.	Arguments of Petitioner
Through this business such companies have rendered great and commendable service to the nation in mobilizing small savings and giving a boost to the movement of capital formation in the country.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such companies have placed at the disposal of Governmental institutions including public sector banks and other financial institutions huge deposits which could not be collected by the said financial institutions themselves or by anybody in the organised sector.	Arguments of Petitioner
The method followed by the companies in carrying on the aforesaid business is that a certain portion of the subscriptions received by it is transferred to the profit and loss account shown as income, and the same is used to defray inevitable working capital requirements of the company, namely, payment of agents commission, management expenses, staff salaries and other overheads.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, the balance of the subscriptions (excluding the appropriated part) is transferred to a fund each year and the corpus of the fund is invested in turn in interest bearing investment.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Peerless company initially used to transfer approximately 95 of the first ye ars subscriptions to the profit and loss account and used to invest the subscriptions received from the second year onwards.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, at present, Peerless is appropriating 25 of the first years subscription to the profit and loss account and investing the balance 75 in the manner and mode prescribed by paragraph 6 of the directions of 1987.It has been contended that the investment is planned in such a manner that at the end of the contractually stipulated maturity period or at any other point of time when any sum of money may become contractually payable to a depositor, an RNBC is always in a position to pay all its conractual dues to the certificate holder.	Arguments of Petitioner
There is thus no threat to the safety of the depositors money inspite of the aforesaid transfer of a portion of the subscription received to the profit and loss account showing it as income and utilising it for meeting the working capital requirements.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that Peerless had been assessed to income on the basis of above method of accounting and no objection has ever been taken by the revenue authorities or by the auditors of Peerless or even by R.B.I. before the issuance of the directions of 1987.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that the Peerless was incorporated in the year 1932 when it used to carry on life insurance business.	Arguments of Petitioner
It changed over to the present form of business from 1956 and since then it has been carrying on such business with the full knowledge of R.B.I. as well as other concerned authorities.	Arguments of Petitioner
The R.B.I. never objected to the accounting system followed by the Peerless.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of the abolition of the forfeiture clause the alleged risk to the depositors has become totally non existent.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further argued that the R.B.I. framed regulatory measures in 1973 such miscellaneous nonbanking companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1973.	None
The Reserve Bank granted exception to Peerless from the provisions of the said Directions of 1973, by an order dated 3rd December, 1973.	None
The Favourite Small Investments Limited filed a writ petition challenging the refusal of Reserve Bank to grant exemption to them from the provisions of the said 1973 Directions to granting such exemption to Peerless.	None
In the said writ petition the R.B.I. filed an affidavit justifying the denial of exemption to Favourite Small Investments Ltd. and in the aforesaid affidavit submitted in detail the accounting procedure of Peerless including the fact that Peerless was transferring a portion of the subscriptions to the profit and loss account as income and it also certified that the said method was a permissible business method and by following the said method Peerless would be in a position to pay all contractual dues of the certificate holders at the end of the maturity period.	None
Thus the said system of accounting which is called an actuarial system of accounting was found satisfactory by the R.B.I.	None
The said affidavit filed in the Favourites case has been quoted in the Peerless case in 1987 SCC 424, and the said actuarial system of accounting was not held as impermissible or against any recognized method of accounting.	None
It was also contended on behalf of the Peerless that the interest of depositors is certainly an important consideration but the interest of the depositors is not impaired in any manner whatsoever by the method of accountancy now being followed by Peerless and in fact by all similar companies, namely, appropriation of a part of the subscription to the profit and loss account and meeting the working capital requirements out of the same.	Arguments of Petitioner
In respect of the above contention certain charts were also produced during the course of arguments and from such charts it was sought to establish that except for the first two years the principal amount paid by a subscriber is always covered by matching investment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, on the date on which a deposit becomes contractually repayable, there is full coverage of such liability.	None
It was submitted on behalf of All India Peerless Field Officers Association that the said association rep resents about 14 lac field workers.	None
These 14 lac persons are engaged by Peerless on the basis of individual contracts of engagements and earn their livelihood solely by collecting business for Peerless.	Arguments of Petitioner
For collecting such business Peer less pays to them commission at a contractual agreed percentage on the value of business collected.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said field officers have to meet all expenses for procuring such business such as travelling expenses, boarding, lodging, office and administrative expenses etc. out of such commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
Field officers have to undertake long tours and have to travel into remote villages to reach the small depositors.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been submitted that if the directions of 1987 are upheld, the undertaking of Peerless will face inevitable closure and almost 14 lac field officers will lose their only source of livelihood and will be virtually thrown on the streets.	Arguments of Petitioner
The field officers and their families will face starvation and extreme penury in case the validity of such directions is upheld.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus any restriction which would be prohibitive or which would result in closure of the undertaking of Peerless would be against public interest.	None
We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties.	None
It may be made clear at the outset that questions raised in these cases regarding the validity of paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987 cannot be determined me rely by taking into consideration the working of the financial soundness of the one company alone like Peerles but the matter has to be examined in a broader perspective of all RNBCs.	Reasoning
We have to keep in mind, while deciding the controversies raised in the arguments, such RNBCs which are doing the same kind of business of taking deposits and returning the same to the certificate holders after a gap of 7 to 10 years along with interest, bonus etc.	Reasoning
In the affidavit submitted before this Court on behalf of Reserve Bank of India it has been stated that prior to 1987 directions, there were 747 such companies which were conducting this business under various deposit schemes.	Reasoning
At present they could classify 392 such companies spread over across the entire country.	Reasoning
According to the above affidavit, as on 31st March, 1990 in the eastern zone out of 185 companies, only 35 have filed the annual returns and out of which only 30 have filed the balance sheet.	Reasoning
Similarly, out of 140 companies in the northern zone only 28 have filed annual returns and 32 have filed balance sheet.	Reasoning
A perusal of the returns given by 51 of these companies discloses that 35 companies have a negative net worth (i.e. their losses far exceed their share capital and reserves) which necessarily means that they have not only wiped out the share capital and reserves but their liabilities are far in excess.	Reasoning
Only 16 companies have a positive net worth including Pee rless.	Reasoning
It has been further pointed out in the affidavit that apart from Peerless the aggregate capital investment by 15 companies is Rs. 158 lacs only.	Reasoning
As against this, the negative net worth of the 35 companies aggregated to Rs. 3.6 crores.	Reasoning
Des pite large accumulated losses (in some cases with meager or nominal capital) these companies apart from Peerless, have realised deposits to the tune of Rs. 86 crores.	Reasoning
Apart from the financial parameters most of these small companies are family co ncerns.	Reasoning
Most of such companies have not designated their banks as is required under Paragraph 6 of the directions and in most of such cases amounts deposited in banks and approved securities fall much short of deposit liabilities.	Reasoning
It has also been pointed out in the affidavit that the companies operating in these areas also at times become untraceable in that a number of show cause notices issued have been returned as addressee not known etc.	Reasoning
Thus we have to keep in mind the above mushroom of companies also which have set foot in this sort of business.	None
It would also be important to note that most of the depositors in such companies belong to the rural areas and who are persons belonging to lower middle class, small agriculturists and small traders, pensioners etc.	Reasoning
These companies advertise their schemes widely in beguiling terms.	Reasoning
Through such advertisements they lure the small savings of the poor ignorant villagers through a special structure of agents, special agents, different kinds of organisers and so on.	Reasoning
The agents commission for the first years subscription is very high and which offers incentive to the agent s on securing a fresh business and a disincentive to collect subscriptions of subsequent years.	None
It is a matter of common experience and knowledge that most rural folk particularly those belonging to the lower strata of society will not pay their subscriptions regularly unless somebody takes the trouble of collecting their subscription with the same enthusiasm as may be shown in enrolling the subscribers in the beginning.	None
It is no doubt correct that these companies do tap and collect the deposits from such areas where the agents of public sector banks or public sector companies or instrumentalities of the state are unable to reach.	Reasoning
Thus these companies mop up a large amount of money for ultimately investing in the nationalised bank or other Govt.	Reasoning
owned corporations or companies.	Reasoning
However, the Reserve Bank considered the safety of the money of the depositors as the paramount consideration in issuing the direction of 1987.	Reasoning
It cannot be disputed that the interest of the employees as well as the field officers and agents have also to be taken into consideration while deciding the reasonableness of the impugned directions.	None
It may be further noted that in the Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless Company case (supra) this Court though came to the conclusion that the Endowment Certificate Scheme of the Peerless company was outside the Prize Chit and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, still it was observed that it would be open to t he Reserve Bank to take such steps as are open to them in law to regulate schemes such as those run by the Peerless company to prevent exploitation of ignorant subscribers though care must also be taken to protect the thousands of employees.	None
The Court expressed grave concern with regard to the mushroom growth of financial investment companies offering staggeringly high rates of interests to depositors leading to the suspicion whether these companies are not speculative ventures floated to attract unwary and credulous investors and capture their savings.	None
It was clearly pointed out that if the Reserve Bank of India considers the Peerless company with 800 crores invested in Govt.	None
securities, fixed deposits with national banks etc. unsafe for depositors one wonders what they have to say about the mushroom of nonbanking companies which are accepting deposits promising most unlikely returns and as such what action was proposed to be taken by the R.B.I. to protect the investors.	Facts
In the above background the Reserve Bank came forward with the impugned directions of 1987.	None
Before examining the scope and effect of the impugned paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987, it is also important to note that Reserve Bank of India which is bankers bank is a creature of Statute.	None
It had large contingent of expert advice relating to matters affecting the economy of the entire country and nobody can doubt the bonafides of the Reserve Bank in issuing the impunged directions of 1987.	None
The Reserve Bank plays an important role in the economy and financial affairs of India and one of its important functions is to regulate the banking system in the country.	None
It is the duty of the Reserve bank to safeguard the economy and financial stability of the country.	None
While examining the power conferred by Sec.	None
58A of the Companies Act, 1956 on the Central Govt.	None
to prescribe the limits upto which, the manner in which and the conditions subject to which deposits may be invited or accepted by non banking companies, this Court in Delhi Cloth and General Mills, etc. v. Union of India, etc., 1983 3 S.C.R, 438 observed as under Mischief was known and the regulatory measure was introduced to remedy the mischief.	None
The conditions which can be prescribed to effectuate this purpose must a fortiori, to be valid, fairly and reasonably, relate to checkmate the abuse of juggling with the depositors investors hard earned money by the corporate sector and to confer upon them a measure of protection namely availability of liquid assets to meet the obligation of repayment of deposit which is implicit in acceptance of deposit.	None
Can it be said that the conditions prescribed by the Deposit Rules are so irrelevant or have no reasonable nexus to the objects sought to be achieved as to be arbitrary?	None
The answer is emphatically in the negative.	None
Even at the cost of repetition, it can be stated with confidence that the rules which prescribed conditions subject to which deposits can be invited and accepted do operate to extend a measure of protection against the notorious abuses of economic power by the corporate sector to the detriment of depositors investors, a segment of the society which can be appropriately described as weaker in relation to the mighty corporation.	None
One need not go so far with Ralph Nadar in America Incorporated to establish that political institutions may fail to arrest the control this everwidening power of corporations.	None
And can one wish away the degree of sickness in private sector companies?	None
To the extent companies develop sickness, in direct proportion the controllers of such companies become healthy.	None
In a welfare state, it is the constitutional obligation of the state to protect socially and economically weaker segments of the society against the exploitation by corporations.	None
We therefore, see no merit in the submission that the conditions prescribed bear no relevance to the object or the purpose for which the power was conferred under Sec.	None
58A on the Central Government.	None
The function of the Court is to see that lawful authority is not abused but not to appropriate to itself the task entrusted to that authority.	None
It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers must take care not to exceed or abuse its power.	None
It must keep within the limits of the authority committed to it.	None
It must act in good faith and it must act reasonably.	None
Courts are not to interfere with economic policy which is the function of experts.	None
It is not the function of the Courts to sit in Judgment over matters of economic policy and it must necessarily be left to the expert bodies.	None
In such matters even experts can seriously and doubtlessly differ.	None
Courts cannot be expected to decide them without even the aid of experts.	None
The main grievance raise d on behalf of respondent companies is that if the provisions of paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987 are complied with, the companies will be left without any fund to meet their working capital.	None
It would be impossible to run the business without a working capital and to meet even reasonable expenses incurred for payment of agents commission, management expenses and other overhead expenses.	None
During the course of hearing the counsel for the companies had relied on some charts to show the unworkability and unreasonableness of the impugned paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also pointed out that the arguments made on behalf of the Reserve Bank overlooked the fact that in case of investments in long term schemes such as Indira Vikas Patra and Kisan Vikas Patra the companies will not be able to utilise its return from such investment before the end of the minimum period for which these schemes operate.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondent companies will thus be left without any income during the period of operation of such schemes and cannot meet its working capital requirements.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been submitted that the directions of 1987 really amount to prohibition of the business in a commercial sense without rea sonable basis and are thus violative of Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of the above contention reliance has been placed on Mohammad Yasin v. The Town Area Committee, Jalalabad and another, 1952 SCR 572 Premier Auto mobiles Ltd. and anothers v. Union of India, 1972 AIR(SC) 1690 and on Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Union of India 1974 AIR(SC) 366.	Arguments of Respondent
It has also been contended that it is now well settled by plethora of judicial pronouncements that the restrictions on any business caused by regulations should not be more than what would be necessary in the interest of the general public and such restrictions should not overreach the scope of the object s achieved by the regulations.	Arguments of Respondent
The contention on behalf of the Reserve Bank is that the directions have been made in public interest of safeguarding the interest of millions of depositors and the Reserve Bank is not concerned and while doing so it was rightly thought necessary by the Reserve Bank that the companies cannot be permitted to incur the expenses out of the corpus of the depositors money.	Reasoning
The business carried on by the companies to restructure their organization by curtailing its expenses.	Reasoning
If such middlemen or brokers are not able to earn a large profit as was done before the enforcement of the impugned directions, it lies with the companies to continue or not such business when the margin o f profit is curtailed.	Reasoning
These companies want to do the business without having any stake of their own.	Reasoning
The companies doing such business cannot be subjected to the scheme of control applied to other financial and nonfinancial companies for the simple reason that they have no capital and their schemes are for a period much longer than three years.	Reasoning
After the decision of the Supreme Court in Peerless case these directions of 1987 were issued after mature consideration with the help and advice of experts.	None
Paragraph 6 of the impugned directions according to the Reserve Bank lays down provisions for security of depositors.	None
it prescribes the mode of investment of funds collected by the companies.	None
It cannot be disputed that while collecting deposits the companies clearly hold out to the members of the public that the moneys so collected by them shall be invested in Government securities or kept deposited with the banks and they also assure the depositors that their moneys are safe and secure.	None
On the basis of such representations and on the strength of exaggerated and misleading advertisements these companies collect huge amounts of deposits from a large number of small, poor and uninformed depositors and that too in such investment spread over a long period.	None
The contention on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India is that in the above context these companies carry on their activities wholly with the funds provided by the public by w ay of deposits and hardly have any capital of their own.	None
In these circumstances it has been urged on behalf of the Reserve Bank that the provisions made in paragraph 6 of, the impugned directions are absolutely reasonable and are for ensuring repayment of deposits.	None
It has been submitted that it is common knowledge that small depositors cannot have recourse to courts for recovering their amounts if the companies do not repay the deposits.	None
The direction in paragraph 6 enjoins on these companies to deposit in fixed deposits with public sector banks or unencumbered approved securities or in other investments, a sum which shall not, at the close of business on 3 1st December, 1987 and thereafter at the end of each half year i.e. 30th June and 31st December not less than the aggregate amounts of the liabilities to the depositors whether or not such amounts have become payable.	None
Thus according to the above provision whole of the aggregate amounts of the liabilities to the depositors whether or not such amounts have become repayable, is required to be deposited or invested.	None
10 of such amount is required to be deposited in public sect or banks and 70 in approved securities and 20 has been allowed to be invested by the company according to its own choice.	None
In order to understand the rigour of the directions laid down in paragraph 6, it would be necessary to understand the scope of other directions as well.	None
Paragraph 4 of the directions lays down that the deposit shall not be accepted for a period of less than 12 months or more than 120 months i.e. one years from the date of receipt of such deposits.	None
The normal standard applied to non financial and financial companies is that they cannot accept deposits for a period of more than 36 months (except housing finance company).	None
Thus the companies before us have been permitted to conduct their schemes extending over to a long period upto 120 months.	None
This is a special kind of concession provided to the companies of the kind before us.	None
Paragraph 5 of the directions relates to the minimum rate of return fixed at 10 per annum for a deposit with a maturity of 10 years.	None
It is a matter of common knowledge that in the present times even the public sector corporations and banks and other financial and nonfinancial companies pay interest at much more higher rates ranging fro m 14 to 18 .	None
Thus according to the above scheme the respondent companies and the others doing such business can easily earn a profit of 4 to 5 on their investments.	None
In case of a request of the depositors for repayment of the deposit before maturity then the amount payable by the company by way of interest etc., shall be 2 less than what could have been ordinarily paid by the company by way of interest if the deposit had run the full contractual period.	None
However, the question of re payment before maturity or after how many years will depend entirely on the terms and conditions of the contract of such deposit.	None
Paragraph 12 of the directions of 1987 enjoins upon the company to disclose as liabilities in its books of accounts and balance sheets the total amount of deposits received together with interest, bonus, premium or other advantage, accrued or payable to the depositors.	None
Under Clause (a) to the explanation to clause 3 of paragraph 6 Aggregate Amounts of Liabilities shall mean total amount of deposits received together with interest, premium, bonus or other advantage by whatever name called, accrued on the amount of deposits according to the terms of contract.	None
Thus the company is required to deposit or invest the aggregate amounts of its liabilities having accrued on the amount of deposits according to the terms of contract.	None
Without going into the figures shown in the various charts, it is clear that if the directions contained in paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987 are to be carried out, the companies are not left to utilise any amount out of the deposits as working capital to meet the expenses.	None
In our view the Reserve Bank is right in taking the stand that if these companies want to do their business, they should invest their own working capital and find such resources elsewhere with which the Reserve Bank has no concern.	None
If we look at the Annual Report and Accounts of Peerles for the years 1988, 1989 and 1990 it is clear that it had conducted its business following the impugned directions of 1987 and still had earned substantial profits in these years.	None
It is clear that Peerless is a company having established as back as in 1932 and had substantial funds to invest the entire amount of deposits and had met the expenses out of its accumulated profits of the past years.	None
This shows that the business can be run and profit c an be earned even after complying with the impugned directions of 1987 issued by the Reserve Bank.	None
It is not the concern of this court to find out as to whether actuarial method of accounting or any other method would be feasible or possible to adopt by the companies while carrying out the conditions contained in paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987.	None
The companies are free to adopt any mode of accounting permissible under the law but it is certain that they will have to follow the entire terms and conditions contained in the impugned directions of 1987 including those contained in paragraphs 6 and 12.	None
It is not the function of the Court to amend and lay down some other directions and the High Court was totally wrong in doing so.	None
The function of the Court is not to advise in matters relating to financial and economic policies for which bodies like Reserve Bank are fully competent.	None
The Court can only strike down some or entire directions issued by the Reserve Bank in case the Court is satisfied that the directions were wholly unreasonable or violative of any provisions of the Constitution or any Statute.	None
It would be hazardous and risky for the courts to tread an unknown path and should leave such task to the expert bodies.	None
This court has repeatedly said that matters of economic policy ought to be left to the Government.	None
While dealing with the validity of an order passed on September 30, 1977 fixing a retail price of mustard oil not exceeding Rs. 10 per kilogram in exercise of powers conferred by Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, a bench of 7 Judges of this Court in M s Prag Ice Oil Mills and another v. Union of India and Nav Bharat Oil Mills and another v. Union of India 1978 (3) SCC 459 observed as under We have listened to long arguments directed at showing us that producers and sellers of oil in various parts of the country will suffer so that they would give up producing or dealing in mustard oil.	None
It was urged that this would, quite naturally, have its repercussions on consumers for whom mustard oil will become even more scarce than ever ultimately.	None
We do not think that it is the function of this Court or of any Court to sit in judgment over such matters of economic policy as must necessarily be left to the Government of the day to decide.	None
Many of them, as a measure of price fixation must necessarily be, are matters of prediction of ultimate results on which even experits can seriously err and doubtlessly be differ.	None
Courts can certainly not be expected to decide them without even the aid of experts.	None
In Shri Sitaram Sugar Company Limited and another v. Union of India others with U.P. State Sugar Corporation Ltd., and another v. Un ion of India Others, 1990 (3) SCC 223 this Court observed as under Judicial review is not concerned with matters of economic policy.	None
The Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or its agents as to matters within the province of either.	None
The Court does not supplant the feel of expert by its own views.	None
When the legislature acts within the sphere of its authority and delegates power to an agent , it may empower the agent to make findings of fact which are conclusive provided such findings satisfy the test of reasonableness.	None
In all such cases, judicial inquiry is confined to the question whether the fin dings of fact are reasonably on evidence and whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land.	None
In R.K. Garg v. Union of India others, etc. etc., 1981 (4) SCC 675 at p. 690 a Constitution Bench of this Court observed as under Another rule of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion etc.	None
It has been said by no less a person than Holmes, J. that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straitjacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where, having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with, greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature.	None
The Court should feel more inclined to give judicial defence to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved.	None
Nowhere has this admonition been more felicitously expressed than in Morey v. Doud where Frankfurter, J. said in his Inimitable styleIn the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial deference to legislative Judgment.	None
The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility.	None
The courts have only the power to destroy, not to reconstruct.	None
When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation, the uncertainty, the liability to er ror the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the judges have been overruled by eventsself limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability.	None
It may also be noted that it is not possible for the Court to determine as to how much percentage of deposit of first instalment should be allowed towards expenses which may consist of commission to agents, office expenses etc.	None
Even amongst the three companiesviz.	None
Peerless, Timex and Favourite, there is a difference in this regard.	Reasoning
According to the Peerless 25 , Timex 50 and Favorite 60 of the deposits of the first instalment would be necessary for generating the working capital for meeting the genuine expenses.	Reasoning
Thus it would depend from company to company based on various factors such as paidupcapital, percentage of commission paid to the agents, rate of interest paid to the depositors, period of maturity for repayment, office expenses and various other factors necessary to mop up working capital out of the depositors money.	Reasoning
We cannot ignore the possibility of persons having no stake of their own starting such business and after collecting huge deposits from the investors belonging to the poor and weaker section of the society residing in rural areas, and to stop such business after a few years and thus devouring the hard earned money of the small investors.	Reasoning
It cannot be lot sight that in such kind of business, the agents always take interest in finding new depositors because they get a high rate of commission out of the first instalment, but they do not have same enthusiasm in respect of deposit of subsequent instalments.	Reasoning
In these circumstances, if the Reserve Bank has issued the directions of 1987 to safeguard the larger interest of the public and small depositors it cannot be said that the directions are so unreasonable as to be declared constitutionally invalid.	Reasoning
It has been vehemently contended before us on behalf of the Peerless employees and field agents that in case the impugned directions are not struck down, the Peerless will have to close down its business and several thousands of employees and their family and several lakhs of field agents would be thrown on the street and left with no employment.	None
We do not find any force in the above contention.	None
So far as Peerless is concerned there is no possibility of its closing down such business.	Reasoning
It has already large accumulated funds collected by making profits in the past several years.	Reasoning
Thus it has enough working capital in order to meet the expenses.	None
We are not impressed with the argument of Mr. Somnath Chatterjee, Learned Senior Advocate for the Peerless that after some years the Peerless will have to close down its business if directions contained in paragraphs 6 and 12 are to be followed.	None
T he working capital is not needed every year as it can be rotated after having invested once.	Reasoning
If the entire amount of the subscribers is deposited or invested in the proportion of 10 in public sector banks, 70 in approved securities and 20 in other investments, such amounts will also start earning interest which can be added and adjusted while depositing or investing the subsequent years of deposits of the subscribers.	Reasoning
In any case it lies with the new entrepreneurs while entering such field of business to make arrangement of their own resources for working capital and for meeting the expenses and they cannot insist in utilising the money of the depositors for this purpose.	Reasoning
So far as the companies already in this field they must have earned profits in the past years which can be utilised as their working capital.	Reasoning
It is important to note that the impugned directions of 1987 have been made applicable from 15th May, 1987 prospectively and not retrospectively.	Reasoning
Thus under these directions the question of depositing the entire amount of subscriptions would only apply to the deposits made after 15th May, 1987.	None
We may also observe that the impugned directions of 1987 as well as any other directions issued from time to time by the Reserve Bank relating to economic or financial policy are never so sacrosanct that the same cannot be changed.	None
Even the financial budget for every year depends on the economic and financial policy of the Government existing at the relevant time.	Reasoning
So far as the impugned directions are concerned if it is found in future that the same are not workable or working against the public interest, the Reserve Bank is always free to change its policy and scrap or amend the directions as and when necessary.	Reasoning
We have no doubt that if in times to come the Reserve Bank feels that business of the kind run at present by Peerless and other companies, in terms of the directions of 1987 are not yielding the result as envisaged by the Reserve Bank, it will always be prepared to consider any new proposals which may be conducive both in the interest of the large multitude of the investors as well as the employees of such companies.	Reasoning
Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Reserve Bank made a candid statement on behalf of the Reserve Bank that the Reserve Bank would always be	None
pre pared to consider any new proposal which would observe the public interest.	None
In the result I set aside the orders of the High Court and allow the appeals arising out SLP Nos. 693030	Decision

K.RAMASWAMY, J.	None
While respectfully agreeing with my learned brother since the issues bear far reaching seminal importance, I propose to express my views as well.	None
This Court in Reserve Bank of India etc. v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co.	None
Ltd. Ors. etc., 1987 (2) SCR 1 for short first Peerless case while holding that Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978 d oes not attract Recurring Deposits Schemes, pointed out that the schemes harshly operate against the poor sections of the society who require security and protection urgent action appeared to be called for and was imperative to protect the public and emphasized to evolve fool proof scheme to prevent fraud being played upon persons not conversant with practices of the financial enterprises who pose themselves as benefactors of the people.	None
In pursuance thereof the appellant, Reserve Bank of India, for short RBI issued Residuary NonBanking Companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1987 for short the Directions.	None
The short shift with avid eye into the relevant provisions of the Reserve Bank of India Act 2 of 1934 for short the Act and the directions would enable us to come to grips with the scope of the scheme of the directions, its purpose and operation.	None
Chapter III(B) of the Act deals with the power of RBI to regulate nonbanking institutions receiving deposits.	None
Section 45 (1) (bb) defines deposit includes and shall be deemed always to have included any receipt or money by way of deposit or loan or in any other form but does not include exceptions are not relevant and hence are omitted.	None
Section 45(1) (c) defines financial institution to mean any nonbanking institution which carries on its business, or part of its business, in any of the following activities clauses (i) to (v) are omitted, clause (vi) collecting for any purpose of any scheme or arrangement by whatever name called, monies in lumpsum or otherwise by way of subscriptionor in any other manner by awarding prizes or gifts, whether in cash or kind or disbursing monies in any other way to persons from whom monies are collected or to any other persons but does not includethe exclusions are not relevant and hence omitted.	None
Section 45J empowers that RBI may, if it considers necessary in the public interest so to do, by general or special order, (a) regulate or prohibit the issue by any nonbanking institution of any prospectus or advertisement soliciting deposits of money from the public and (b) specify t	None
he conditions, subject to which any such prospectus or advertisement, if not prohibited, may be issued.	None
Section 45K empowers the RBI to collect information from nonbanking institution as to deposit and to give directions that every nonbanking institution shall furnish to the Bank, in such form, at such intervals and within such time, such statements, information or particulars relating to or connected with deposits received by the nonbanking institution, as may be specified by RBI by general or special order including the rates of interest and other terms and conditions on which they are received.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under subsection (3) thereof the RBI is entitled to issue in the public interest directions to nonbanking institution in respect of any matter relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits including the rates of interest payable on such deposits and the periods for which deposits may be received.	Arguments of Petitioner
The use of the adjective any matter relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits is wide and comprehensive to empower the RBI to issue directions in connection therewith or relating to the receipt of deposits.	None
But exercise of power is hedged with and should be in the public interest.	None
Section 45L provides that if the RBI is satisfied that for the purpose of enabling it to regulate the credit system of the country to its advantage it is necessary so to do it may give to such institutions either generally or to any such institution, in particular, directions relating to the conduct of business by them or by it as financial institution or institutions including furnishing of information of particulars relating to paid up capital, reserves or other liabilities, the investments whether in the Government securities or otherwise, the persons to whom, and the purposes and periods for which finance is provided the terms and conditions, including the rates of interest, on which it is provided.	None
Section 45Q provides that the provisions of this chapter shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law.	None
The directions became operative from May 15, 1987.	None
They would apply to every Residuary NonBanking Company for short R.N.B.C which receive any deposit scheme in l umpsum or in instalment by way of contribution or subscription or by sale of units of certificates or other instruments or in any other manner vide Clause II of the definition.	None
Clause III(A) defines deposits as defined in s.45(1) (bb) of the Act.	None
Paragraph 4 regulates receipt of deposits for a period not less than 12 months and not more than 120 months from the first day of the receipt of the deposit.	None
Paragraph 5 prescribes minimum rate of return of 10 per cent per annum (to be compounded annually) on the amount deposited.	None
The proviso empowers R.N.B.C. at the request of the depositor to make repayment of the deposit, after the expiry of a period of one year from the date of the deposit but before the expiry of the period the deposit with two per cent reduced rate of interest from 10 interest.	None
Paragraph 6, the heart of the directions consists of three subparagraphs with explanations.	None
The marginal note expresses security for depositors.	None
Subparagraph (1) thereof provides that on and from May 15, 1987 every R.N.B.C. shall deposit and keep deposited in fixed deposits with public sector banks or invest and keep invested in unencumbered approved securities (such securities being valued at their mark et value for the time being), or in other investments, which in the opinion of the company are safe, a sum which shall not, at the close of business on 31 st December, 1987 and thereafter at the end of each half year that is, 30th June and	None
31st Dec ember be less than the aggregate amounts of the liabilities to the depositors whether or not such amounts have become payable.	None
The proviso specifies that the sum so deposited or invested (a) not less than 10 per cent shall be in fixed deposits with a ny of the public sector banks (b) not less than 70 per cent shall be in approved securities and (c) not more than 20 per cent or 10 times the net owned funds of the company, whichever amount is less, shall be in other investments.	None
Provided that such investments shall be with the approval of the Board of Directors of the company, the explanation Net Owned funds shall mean the aggregate of the paidup capital and free reserves as appearing in the latest audited balance sheet of the company as reduce d by the amount of accumulated balance of loss, deferred revenue expenditure and other intangible assets, if any, as disclosed in the said balance sheet.	None
Subparagraph (2) enjoins toe R.N.B.C to entrust to one of the public sector banks designated in that behalf.	None
Deposits and securities referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to subparagraph (1) to be held by such designated bank is for the benefit of the depositors.	None
Such securities and deposits shall not be withdrawn b y the R.N.B.C. or otherwise dealt with, except for repayment to the depositors.	None
Subparagraph (3) obligates it to furnish to the R.B.I. within 30 days from the close of business on 31st December, 1987 and thereafter at the end of each half year i.e., as on 30th June and	None
31st December, a certificate from its auditors, being member of institute of Chartered Accountants, to the effect that the amounts deposited in fixed deposits and the investment made are not less than the aggregate amounts of liabilities to the depositors as on 30th June and 31st December of that year.	None
Explanation thereto makes explicit what the aggregate amount of liabilities approved securities and public sector banks and unencumbered approved securities are meant to be the details of which are not necessary for the purpose of this case.	None
Paragraph 7 abolishes the power of the R.N.B.C. of forfeiture of deposits paragraph 8 prescribes particulars to be mentioned in the form soliciting deposits paragraph 9 enjoins issuance of the receipts to the depositors and paragraph 10 obligates to maintain the register with particulars of depositors mentioned there in.	None
Paragraph II enjoins its Board of Directors to furnish the information in their report as envisaged therein.	None
Paragraph 12 which is also material for the purpose of this case provides that every R.N.B.C. shall disclose as liabilities in its books of accounts and balance sheets, the total amount of deposits received together with interest, bonus, premium or other advantage, accrued or payable to the depositors.	None
Paragraph 13 enjoins to supply to R.B.I. copies of the balance sheets and accounts together with Directors report.	None
Paragraph 14 obligates the company to submit returns to the R.B.I. in the manner envisaged thereunder.	None
R.N.B.C. has to submit balance sheet, returns etc.	None
to the department of the Financial Companies as per paragraph 15.	None
Paragraph 16 obligates R.N.B.C. to comply with the requirement of the nonbanking financial companies and miscellaneous nonbanking companies (Advertisement) Rules, 1977 etc. and actual rate of interest etc.	None
to the depositor.	None
Paragraph 17 applies to the prospective R.N.B.C. to furnish information in Schedule C. Paragraph 18 accords transitory power and paragraph 19 empowers the R.B.I., if it considers necessary to avoid any hardship or for any other just and sufficient reasons, to grant extensions of time to comply with or exempt, any company or class of companies, from all or any of the provisions of the directions either generally or for any specified period, subject to such conditions as the RBI may impose and paragraph 20 excludes the applicability of paragraph 19 of the NonBanking Financial Companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1977.	None
The High Court declared paragraphs 6 and 12 to be ultra vires of Art. 19(1)(g) and 14 of the Constitution holding that though the directions do not expressly prohibit the business of receiving any deposit under any scheme or arrangement in lumpsum or in instalment by way of contribution or subscription by R.N. B.C. in effect the operation of the directions inhibit the existing business and prohibits the future companies to come into being.	None
As seen the public purpose of the directions is to secure for the depositors, return of the amounts payable at maturity together with interest, bonus, premium or any other advantage accrued or payable to the depositors.	None
To achieve that object every R.N.B.C. is enjoined to deposit and keep deposited in fixed deposit and invest and keep invested in unencumbered approved securities a sum which shall not, at the close of each half year, be less than the aggregate amount of the liability to the depositors whether or not such amount has become payable.	None
The object, thereby, is to prohibit deployment of funds by R.N.B.C. in any other manner which would work detrimental to the interest of the depositors.	None
The question emerges whether paragraph 6 and 12 are ultra vires of Articles 19(1)(g) and 14 of the Constitution.	None
Article 19(1)(g) provides fundamental rights to all citizens to carry on any occupation, trade or business.	None
Cl. 6 thereof empowers the State to make any law imposing, in the interest of the general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the said rights.	None
Wherever a statute is challenged as violative of the fundamental rights, its real effect or operation on the fundamental rights is of primary importance.	None
It is the duty of the court to be watchful to protect the constitutional rights of a citizen as against any encroachment gradually or stealthily thereon.	None
When a law has imposed restrictions on the fundamental rights, what the court has to examine is the substance of the legislation without being beguiled by the mere appearance of the legislation.	None
The Legislature cannot disobey the constitutional mandate by employing an indirect method.	None
The court must consider not merely the purpose of the la w but also the means how it is sought to be secured or how it is to be administered.	None
The object of the legislation is not conclusive as to the validity of the legislation.	None
This does not mean the constitutionality of the law shall be deter mined with reference to the manner in which it has actually been administered or operated or probably been administered or operated by those who are charged with its implementation.	None
The court cannot question the wisdom, the need or desirability of the regulation.	None
The state can regulate the exercise of the fundamental right to save the public from a substantive evil.	None
The existence of the evil as well as the means adopted to check it are the matters for the legislative judgment.	None
But the court is entitled to consider whether the degree and mode of the regulation whether is in excess of the requirement or is imposed in any arbitrary manner.	Issue
The court has to see whether the measure adopted is relevant or appropriate to the power exercised by the authority or whether over stepped the limits of social legislation.	None
Smaller inroads may lead to larger inroads and ultimately result in total prohibition by indirect method.	None
If it directly transgresses or substantially and inevitably effects the fundamental right, it becomes unconstitutional, but not where the impact is only remotely possibly or incidental.	None
The court must lift the veil of the form and appearance to discover the true character and the nature of the legislation, and every endeavor should be made to have the efficacy of fundamental right maintained and the legislature is not invested with unbounded power.	None
The court has, therefore, always to guard against the gradual encroachments and strike down a restriction as soon as it reaches that magnitude of total annihilation of the right.	None
However, there is presumption of constitutionality of every statute and its validity is not to be determined by artificial standards.	None
The court has to examine with some strictness the substance of the legislation to find what actually and really the legislature has done.	None
The court would not be over persuaded by the mere presence of the legislation.	None
In adjudging the reasonableness of the law, the court will necessarily ask the question whether the measure or scheme is just, fair, reasonable and appropriate or is it unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interferes wit h the exercise of the right guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution.	None
Once it is established that the statute is prima facie unconstitutional, the state has to establish that the restrictions imposed are reasonable and the objective test which the court to employ is whether the restriction bears reasonable relation to the authorized purpose or an arbitrary encroachment under the garb of any of the exceptions envisaged in Part III.	None
The reasonableness is to the necessity to impose restriction the means adopted to secure that end as well as the procedure to be adopted to that end.	None
The court has to maintain delicate balance between the public interest envisaged in the impugned provision and the individuals right taking into account, the nature of his right said to be infringed the underlying purpose of the impugned restriction the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby the disproportion of the restriction imposed, the prevailing conditions at the time, the surrounding circumstances the larger public interest which the law seeks to achieve and all other relevant factors germane for the purpose.	None
All these factors should enter into the zone of consideration to find the reasonableness of the impugned restriction.	None
The court weighs in each case which of the two conflicting public or private interest demands greater protection and if it finds that the restriction imposed is appropriate, fair and reasonable, it would uphold the restriction.	None
The court would not uphold a restriction which is not germane to achieve the purpose of the statute or is arbitrary or out of its limits.	None
This Court in Joseph Kuruvilla Vell ukunnel v. Reserve Ban k of India Ors., 1962 (S3)	None
SCR 632, held that the RBI is a bankers bank and lender of the last resort.	None
Its objective is to ensure monetary stability in India and to operate regulate the credit system of the country.	None
It has, therefore, to perform a delicate balance between the need to preserve and maintain the credit structure of the country by strengthening the rule as well as apparent credit worthiness of the banks operating in the country and the interest of the depositors.	None
In under developed country like ours, where majority population are illiterate and poor and are not conversant with banking operations and in under developed money and capital market with mix ed economy, the constitution charges the state to prevent exploitation and so the RBI would play both promotional and regulatory roles.	None
Thus the R.B.I. occupies place of preeminence to ensure monetary discipline and to regulate the economy or the credit system of the country as an expert body.	None
It also advices the Government in public finance and monetary regulations.	None
The banks or nonbanking institutions shall have to regulate their operations in accordance with, not only as per the provisions of the Act but also the rules and directions or instructions issued by the RBI in exercise of the power thereunder.	None
Chapter 3B expressly deals with regulations of deposit and finance received by the R.N.B.Cs.	None
The directions, therefore, are statutory regulations.	None
In State of U.P. v. Babu Ram, 1961 (2) SCR 679 , this Court held that rules made under a statute must be treated, for all purposes of construction or obligations, exactly as if they were in that Act and are to t he same effect as if they contained in the Act and are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction or obligations.	None
The statutory rules cannot be described or equated with administrative directions.	None
In D.V.K. Prasada Rao v. Govt.	None
of A.P., 1984 AIR(AP) 75, the same view was laid.	None
Therefore, the directions are incorporated and become part of the Act itself.	None
They must be governed by the same principles as the statute itself.	None
The statutory presumption t hat the legislature inserted every part thereof for a purpose to and the legislative intention should be given effect to, would be applicable to the impugned directions.	None
The R.B.I. issued the directions to regulate the operations of the R.N.B.Cs., to safeguard the interest of the depositors.	None
Payment of interest, bonus, premium or other advantage, in whatever name it may be called is reward for waiting or parting with liquidity.	None
It is paid because of positive time preference ( one rupee today is preferred to one rupee tomorrow)on the part of the depositor.	None
Therefore, the directions avowed to preserve the right of the depositors to receive back the amount deposited with the contracted rate of interest it aims to prevent depletion of the deposits collected from the weaker segments of the society and also tends to effect free flow of the business of the R.N.B.Cs. who would desire to operate in their own way.	None
The question, therefore, emerges whether the directions in paras 5 and 12 violate Arts.	None
14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.	None
The solidarity of political freedom hinges upon socio economic democracy.	None
The right to development is on e of the most important facets of basic human rights.	None
The right to self interest is inherent in right to life.	None
Mahatma Gandhiji, the Father of the Nation, said that Every human being has a right to live and therefore to find the wherewithal to feed himself, and where necessary, to clothe and house himself .	None
Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that everyone has a right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.	None
Right to life includes the right to live with basic human dignity with necessities of life such as nutrition, clothing, food, shelter over the head, facilities for cultural and socioeconomic well being of every individual.	None
Art.	None
21 protects right to life.	None
It guarantees and derives therefrom the minimum of the needs of existence including better tomorrow.	None
Poverty is not always an economic problem alone.	None
Very often it is a social as well as human problem.	None
An agriculturist, an industrial worker, the daily wage earner, rickshaw puller and small selfemployed teacher, artisan, etc. may have an earning but may be prone to spend his her entire earnings, apart from on daily necessities of life, on socioreligious occasions, fairs, festivals etc.	None
The urge for better tomorrow and prosperous future the clamour for freedom from want of any kind and social security, make the vulnerable segments of the society to sacrifice todays comforts to save for better tomorrow.	None
The habit of saving has an educative value for thrift.	None
It endeavors to bring an attitudinal change in life.	None
It enables individuals to assess future specific needs and to build up a financial provision for the purpose.	None
The habit of saving becomes a way of life and harnesses the meagre resources to build up better future.	None
During the days of rising prices, small savings serve as instrument to mop up the extra purchasin g power.	None
In addition to wage a war against poverty, waste, unwise spending, hoarding and other activities, habit of saving also enables family budgeting and postponing expenditure which can be deffered in favour of better utilisation in future.	None
To strengthen the urge for thrift and streamline the social security, the disadvantaged need freedom from exploitation and Art.46 of the constitution enjoins the State to protect the poor from all forms of exploitation and social injustice.	None
Investment agencies or commercial banks are intermediaries between savers and investors.	None
They embark upon deposit mobilisation campaign to mop up the limited resources.	None
Commercial banks or financial investment agencies, be it public sector or private sector, are vying with one another to scale new heights in deposit growth each year, devising different deposit schemes to suit the individual needs of the depositors or savers.	None
Mushroom growth of nonbanking agencies put afloat diverse schemes with alluring offers of staggering high rate of interest and other catchy advantages which would generate suspicion of the bona fides of the offer.	None
But gullible depositors are lured to make deposits.	None
It is not uncommon that after collecting fabulous deposits, some unscrupulous people surreptitiously close the company and decamp with the collections keeping the depositors at bay.	None
Therefore, the need to regulate the deposits subscriptions, in particular, in private sector became imperative to prevent exploitation or mismanagement as social justice stratagem.	None
The directions are, therefore, a social control measure over the R.N .B.Cs., in matters connected with the operation of the schemes or incidental thereto.	None
The direction to investment in the channelised schemes at the given percentage in clauses (a) and (b) of proviso to para 6(1) was intended to deposit or keep deposited the collections in fixed deposit in the public sector banks or invest or keep invested in unencumbered approved securities so as to ensure safety, steady growth and due payment to the subscribers at maturity of the principal amount an d the interest, bonus, premium or other advantage accrued thereon.	None
The amounts deposited shall not be less than the total aggregate amounts of liabilities to the subscribers.	None
The deposits or securities shall not be withdrawn or otherwise b e dealt with except for a repayment to the subscribers.	None
It should always be shown to be a liability till date of the repayment.	None

(3) SCR 528 , held that freedom to carry on trade or business is not an absolute one.	None
In the interest of the general public, the law may impose restrictions on the freedom of the citizen to start or carry on his business, whether an impugned provision imposing a fetter on the exercise of the fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 19(1)(g) amounts to a reasonable restriction imposed in the interest of general public, must be adjudged not in the background of any theoretical standard or predeterminate patterns, but	None
in the light o	None
f the nature and the incidence of the right, the interest of the general public sought to be secured by imposing restrictions and the reasonableness of the quality and the extent of the fetters imposed by the directions.	None
The credit worthiness of R.N .B.Cs.	None
undoubtedly would be sensitive.	None
It thrives upon the confidence of the public, on the honesty of its management and its reputation of solvency.	None
The directions intended to promote freedom and facility which are required to be regulated in the interest of all concerned.	None
The directions as a part of the scheme of the Act would be protected from the attack.	None
Vide Latafat Ali Khan Ors.	None
v. State of U.P., 1971 Suppl.	None
SCR 719 .	None
The R.N.B.C. is required to conduct its business activities in the interest of the depositors or subscribers who are unorganised, ignorant, gullible and ignorant of the banking operations.	None
If, however, the acts of R.N.B.C. is detrimental to the interest of the depositors, etc. the R.B.I. has power in Chapter 3B to issue directions and the R.N.B.C. is bound to comply with the directions and noncompliance thereof visits with penal action.	None
Admittedly except Peerless General Insurance, the other companies do not have either paidup capital or reserve fund worth the name.	None
Peerless was established in the year 1932 and over the years it built up reserve fund.	None
R.N.B.Cs. are carrying their business by crediting the entire first years collections as a capital receipt under actuarial accounting method.	None
In the affidavit of Sri S.S. Karmic, the Chief Officer of the RBI filed on August 13, 1991, it was stated that prior to the directions, 747 R.N.B.Cs. were doing the busi ness.	None
As on that date only 392 R.N.B.Cs. were notified to be existing.	None
Out of them 178 are in West Bengal, 15 in Assam, 26 in Orissa, 6 in Manipur and Meghalaya, 26 in Punjab, 64 in U.P., 22 in Delhi, etc.	None
As on March 31, 1990 out of 185, 35 R .N.B.Cs.	None
alone submitted annual returns, and out of them only 30 have filed their balancesheets.	None
28 R.N.B.Cs.	None
in the northern region filed their annual returns and 23 filed their balancesheets with incomplete date.	None
35 of them have negative networth (loss for exceeding their share capital and reserve).	None
Apart from Peerless, the aggregate capital investment of 15 companies accounted to Rs. 158 lacs.	Reasoning
The negative networth of the 35 companies referred to above would aggregate to R s.3.6 crores.	Reasoning
They raised, apart from Peerless, deposits to the tune of Rs. 86 crores.	None
Many of them have not even designated their banks as required under para 6 of the direction.	None
The amount invested in bank deposits and approved securities fell much short of their deposit liabilities.	None
Verona Commercial Credit and Investment Company, one of the respondents, have accumulated losses to the tune of Rs. 3.8 crores.	None
As per balancesheet their assets are inadequate to meet the liability.	None
Favourite Small Scale Investment, one of the respondents as on December 12, 1989, even their provisional balancesheet shows that total liability towards depositors is Rs. 44.62 crores while its investment in banks and Government security is only Rs. 13 crores.	None
The cash on hand was Rs. 1.74 crores.	None
Rs.8 crores were shown to be loans and advances.	None
The accumulated losses are Rs.22.19 crores as against total share capital and reserve of Rs. 20.73 lacs.	None
It is, thus, clear on its face that while total liabilities are Rs. 49.09 crores, the assets including doubtful loans and advances aggregate to Rs. 26 crores.	None
An inspection into the affairs of the said company conducted in February, 1990 disclosed that upto the end of 1989 the deposit liabilities including interest would be in the region of over Rs. 132 crores.	None
The difference between the inspection and the balancesheet would be due to actuarial principle.	None
It had committed default to pay to its depositors to the tune of Rs. 5.4 crores, which is a gross underestimate.	None
Sri Somnath Chatterjee, the learned Senior Counsel for the Peerless and adopted by other counsel, contended that paragraphs 6 and 12 are totally u nworkable.	None
Its compliance would jeopardise not only the existing companies but also the very interest of the depositors and large workmen.	Arguments of Petitioner
No new company would be set up.	Arguments of Petitioner
The direction given in the first Peerless case was to keep in view the in terest of the workmen as well in effect it was given a gobye.	Arguments of Petitioner
At least 25 of collections would be left over as working capital of the company, to carry on its business in a manner indicated by the impugned judgment, so that no depositor would lo se his money and no workmen would lose his livelihood and it will be in consonance with public interest.	None
Shri G.L. Sanghi, the learned Senior Counsel for Timex, contended that 50 of collection would be necessary to comply with the impugned directions and another company pleaded for 40.	None
Further contention of Shri Chatterji was that the actuarial accounting neither violates any law, nor objected to by the Incometax Department.	None
Crediting the first years subscription in the accounts as capital receipt would generate companys working capital for its successful business by meeting the expenditure towards establishment, the commission and a part of profits.	None
Forfeiture clause was already dated before the directions were issued.	Arguments of Petitioner
Interest at 10 with annual compounding would be reasonable return to the subscribers which is being ensured to the depositors.	Arguments of Petitioner
The directions issued by the High Court, subject to the above modifications, would subverse the above purpose.	Arguments of Petitioner
Paras 6 and 12, otherwise, are arbitrary and prohibitive violating their fundamental right to do business assured by Arts. 19(1)(g) and 14.	Arguments of Petitioner
Sri Harish Salve resisted the contentions with ability.	None
Para 12 is myocardium and para 6 is t	None
he heart of the directions	None
without which the directions would be purified corpse.	None
On the respondents own showing, for the first two years, by actuarial accounting, the liabilities, as against deposits, are inadequate.	Arguments of Respondent
The regulation intends to pre serve the corpus of the deposits and the interest payable thereon as on date to be a tangible and unencumbered asset at all times, though not repayable.	None
Indisputably the depositors subscribers stand as unsecured creditors.	Reasoning
Undoubtedly every measure cannot be viewed or interpreted in the event of catastrophe overtaking the company.	Reasoning
The catchy and alluring but beguiled terms of offer attract the vulnerable segments of the society to subscribe and keep subscribing the small savings for better tomorrow.	Reasoning
But many a time, by the date of maturity, their hopes are belied and aspirations are frustrated or dashed to ground.	None
They remain to be helpless spectators with all disabilities to recover the amounts.	Reasoning
Pathetic financial position of some of the companies enumerated herein before would amply demonstrate the agony to which the poor subscribers would be subjected to.	Reasoning
The fixed deposits and unencumbered secur ities as per Clauses (a) and (b) of the proviso to paragraph 6(1) would be 80 of the collections of the year of subscription and Shri Chatterji contends to reduce it to 75 and to allow free play to use the residue in their own way.	Arguments of Petitioner
The difference is only 5 and others at vagary.	None
The objects of the direction are to preserve the ability of the R.N.B.C. to pay back to the subscribers depositors at any given time safety of the subscribers money and his right to unencumbered repayment are thus of paramount public interest and the directions aimed to protect them.	None
The directions cannot and would not be adjudged to be ultra vires of arbitrary by reason of successful financial management of an individual company.	None
An over all view of the working system of the scheme is relevant and germane.	None
The obligation in paragraph 12 of periodical disclosure in the accounts of a company of the deposits together with the interest accrued thereon, whether or not payable but admittedly due as a liability, is to monitor the discipline of the operation of the schemes and any infraction, would be dealt with as per law.	None
The certificate by a qualified Chartered Accountant is to vouchsafe the correctness and authenticity of accounts and would and should adhere to the statutory compliance.	None
The settled accounting practice is that a loan or deposit received from a creditor has to be shown as a liability together with accrued interest whether due or deferred.	None
The actuarial accounting applies to revenues and costs to which the concept of the going concern can be adopted.	None
Therefore, in providing the costs of the company it can set apart its costs on the basis that liability is created for interest, bonus etc. payable in foreseeable future.	None
Undoubtedly the actuarial principle applied by the L.I.C. or the gratuity schemes are linked with life of the assured or the premature death before retirement of an employee, but R.N.B.C. in its contract does not undertake any such risk.	None
The deposit is a capital receipt but not a revenue receipt and its full value shall be shown in the account books of balancesheet as liability of the company.	None
It cannot be credited to the profit and loss account.	None
Para II of Schedule VI of the Companies Act, 1956 requires that the amount shown in the profit and loss account should be confined to the income and expenditure of the company.	None
Para 12 of the directions is, thus, in consonance with the Companies Act.	None
Moreover, in its advertisement and the application forms, the R.N.B.C. expressly hold out to the public that their monies are safe with the bank and in th e Government securities.	None
Paragraph 6(1) of the directions only mandates compliance of the promise held out by an R.N.B.C. for repayment at maturity.	None
Subpara (3) of para 6 keeps the deposits unencumbered and to be utilised by the company only for repayment.	None
In other words, paragraph 6 only elongates the contract in the public interest to safeguard the interest of the vulnerable sections of the depositors.	None
The R.B.I. cannot be expected to constantly monitor the working o f the R.N.B.C. in its daytoday function.	None
The actuarial basis cannot be adopted by the R.N.B.Cs.	None
and the liability must always be reflected in its balancesheet at its full value.	None
Compliance of the direction in para 12, dehors any method of accountancy adopted by a company, intended to discipline its operations.	None
Noone can have fundamental right to do any unregulated business with the subscribers depositors money.	None
Even the banks or the financial companies are regulated by ceiling on public deposits fixing nexus between deposits and networth of the company at the ratio of 31, i.e. 25 of the capital networth.	None
No one would legitimately be expected to get immediate profits or dividend without capital investment.	None
The effect of the clause (a) and (b) of the provision to paragraph 6(1) of the direction, no doubt, freezes the right to profit for a short time, and fastens an incidental and consequential obligation to mop up paid up capital or investment towards establishment and commission charges to tide over teething trouble.	None
But that is no ground to say that it is impossible for compliance, nor could it be said that the directions are palpably arbitrary or unreasonable.	None
Anyone may venture to do business without any stake of his own but is subject to the regulations.	None
A new company without any paid up capital, no doubt, cannot be expected to come into existence nor would operate its business at initial existence with profits.	None
Clause (c) of the provision to paragraph 6(1) of the directions gives freedom on leeway to invest or rotate, not more than 20 per cent of collections etc.	None
in any profitable manner at its choice as a prudent businessman to generate its resources to tide over the teething troubles till it is put on rail to receive succor to its existence, without inhibiting the companys capacity to mop up small savings, and the directions do not control its operation.	None
The only rider is the approval of the Board of Directors which is inherent.	None
Absence of imposition of any limit on quantum of deposit with reference to paid up capital or reserve fund like nonbanking financial companies, etc. is a pointer in this regard.	None
Thus there is a reason able nexus between the regulation and the public purpose, namely, security to the depositors money and the right to repayment without any impediment, which undoubtedly is in the public interest.	None
Looking from operational pragmatism, the restrictions though apparently appears to be harsh in form, in its systematic working, it would inculcate discipline in the business management, subserve public confidence in the ability of the company to honour the contractual liability and assure due repayment at maturity of the amount deposited together with interest, etc, without any impediment.	None
In other words, the restrictions in paragraph 6 of the directions intended to elongate the twin purposes, viz.habit of thrift among the needy without unduly jeopardising the interest of the employees of the companies and the R.N.B.Cs working system itself in addition to safety and due payment of depositors money.	None
True, as contended by Shri Chatterji that there arises corresponding obligation to pay higher amount of commission to its agents and the commitment should by kept performed and the confidence enthused in the agents.	None
But it is the look out of the businessman.	None
The absence of ceiling on the rate of commission would give choice between the company and its agents to a contract in this regard and has freedom to manage its business.	None
The R.N.B.Cs. are free to incur such expenses and organize their business as they desire including payment of commission as they think expedient.	None
But the subscribers depositors liability, under no circumstances would be in jeopardy and the directions were designed to ensure that the interest of the subscribers depositors is secured at all times, prescribing investment of an equal sum to the total liability to the subscribers depositors.	None
Paragraph 12 is only a bridge between the depositors and the promise held out and the contract executed in furtherance thereof as a monitoring myocardium to keep the heart in paragraph 6 functioning without any hiatus.	None
It is settled law that regulation includes total prohibition in a given case where the mischief to be remedied warrants total prohibition.	None
Vide Narendra Kumar v. Union of India, 1960 (2) SCR 375.	None
But the directions do not do that but act as a siphon between the subscriber depositor and the business itself.	None
Therefore, they are neither palpably arbitrary nor unjust not unfair.	None
The mechanism evolved in the directions is foolproof, as directed by this court in first Peerles case, to secure the interest of the depositors, as well is capable to monitor the business management of every R.N.B.C.	None
It also, thereby, protects interest of the employees field staff commission agent etc.	None
as on permanent basis overcoming initial convulsions.	None
It was intended, in the best possible manner, to subserve the interest of all without putting any prohibition in the ability of a company to raise the deposit, even the absence of any adequate paid up capital or reserve fund or such precommitment of the owner, to secure such deposits.	None
Thus the directions impose only partial control in the public interest of the depositors.	None
The deposits invested or keep invested qua the company always remained its fund till date of payment at maturity or premature withdrawal in terms of the contract.	None
The effect of the impugned judgment of the Calcutta High Court namely redefinition of the aggregate liabilities as contractual liabilities due and payable would have the effect of requiring the R.N.B.Cs. to deposit an amount equal t o the sum payable only in the year of maturity allowing free play to the R.N.B.Cs. to use the subscriptions deposits in its own manner during the entire earlier period, jeopardise the security of the subscribers depositors and are selfdef eating.	None
The sagging mismanagement prefaced hereinabove would be perpetrated and the depositor was always at the mercy of the company with all disabilities, killing the very goose namely the thrust to save for prosperous future or to t ide over future needs.	None
It is well settled that the court is not a Tribunal from the crudities and inequities of complicated experimental economic legislation.	None
The discretion in evolving an economic measures, rests with the policy makers and not with the judiciary.	None
Indian social order is beset with social and economic inequalities and of status, and in our socialist secular democratic Republic, inequality is an anathema to social and economic justice.	None
The constitution o f India charges the state to reduce inequalities and ensure decent standard of life and economic equality.	None
The Act assigns the power to the RBI to regulate monitory system and the experimentation of the economic legislation, can best be left to the executive unless it is found to be unrealistic or manifestly arbitrary.	None
Even if a law is found wanting on trial, it is better that its defects should be demonstrated and removed than that the law should be aborted by judicial fiat.	None
Such an assert ion of judicial power deflects responsibilities from those on whom a democratic society ultimately rests.	None
The court has to see whether the scheme, measure or regulation adopted is relevant or appropriate to the power exercised by the authority.	None
Prejudice to the interest of depositors is a relevant factor.	None
Mismanagement or inability to pay the accrued liabilities are evils sought to be remedied.	None
The directions designed to preserve the right of the depositors and the ability of R.N.B .C. to pay back the contracted liability.	None
It also intended to prevent mismanagement of the deposits collected from vulnerable social segments who have no knowledge of banking operations or credit system and repose unfounded blind faith on the company with fond hope of its ability to pay back the contracted amount.	None
Thus the directions maintain the thrift for saving and streamline and strengthen the monetary operations of R.N.B.Cs.	None
The problems of Government are practical and do require rough accommodation.	None
Illogical it may be and unscientific it may seem to be, left to its working and if need be, can be remedied by the R.B.I. by pragmatic adjustment that may be called for by particular circumstances.	None
The impugned directions may at first blush seem unjust or arbitrary but when broached in pragmatic perspective the mist is cleared and that the experimental economic measure is manifested to be free from the taints of unconstitutionality.	None
Para 19 of the directions empowers the RBI to extend time for compliance or to exempt a particular company or a class thereof from all or any of the provisions, either generally or for a specified period subject to such conditions as may be imposed.	None
Power to exempt would include the power to be exercised from time to time as exigencies warrant.	None
An individual company or the class thereof has to place necessary and relevant material facts before the R.B.I. of the hardship and the need for relief.	None
A criticism of arbitrariness or unreasonableness may not be ground to undo what was conceived best in the public interest.	None
What is best is not always discernible.	None
The wisdom of any choice may be disputed or condemned.	None
Mere errors of Government are not subject to judicial review.	None
The legislative remedy may be ineffective to mitigate the evil or fail to achieve its purpose, but it is the price to be paid for the trial and error inherent in the economic legislative efforts to grapple with obstinate social issues.	None
It is proper for interference in judicial review, only, when the directions, regulations or restrictions are palpably arbitrary, demonstrably irrelevant or disriminatory.	None
Exercise of power then can be declared to be void under Art. 13 of the Constitution.	None
So long as the exercise of power is broadly within the zone of reasonableness, the court would not substitute its judgment for that of legislature or its agent as to matters within their prudence and power.	None
The court does not supplement the feel of the experts by its own values.	None
It is settled law that so long as the power is traceable to the statute mere omission to recite the provision does not denude the power of the legislature or rule making authority to make the regulations, nor considered without authority of law.	None
Section 114 (h) of the Evidence Act draws a statutory presumption that official acts are regularly performed and reached satisfactorily on consideration of relevant facts.	None
The absence of reiteration of objective satisfaction in the preamble as of one under s.45L does not denude the powers, the R.B.I. admittedly has und er s.45L to justify the actions.	None
Though s.45L was neither expressly stated nor mentioned in the Preamble of the directions of the required recitation of satisfaction of objective facts to issue the directions from the facts and circumstances it is demonstrated that the R.B.I. had such satisfaction in its consideration of its power under s.45L when the directions were issued .	None
Even otherwise s.45K (3) itself is sufficient to uphold the directions.	None
The impugned directions are thus within the power of the R.B.I. to provide tardy, stable, identifiable and monitorable method of operations by each R.N.B.C. and its compliance of the directions.	None
This will ensure security to the depositors at all times and also make the accounts of the company accurate, accountable and easy to monitor the working system of the company itself and continuance of its workmen.	Arguments of Respondent
The directions in paragraphs 6 and 12 are just, fair and reasonable not only to the depositors, but in the long run to the very existence of the company and its continued business itself.	None
Therefore, they are legal, valid and constitutionally permissible.	None
The Writ Petition is dismissed and the appeals are allowed.	None
The Writ Petitions filed in the High Court stand dismissed.	None
No costs in this Court.	None
Petition dismissed.	None
87 Appeals allowed.	None
