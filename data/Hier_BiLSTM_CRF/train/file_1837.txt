Kapadia, J. A short question which arises for determination in this batch of civil appeals is Whether Accounting Standard 22 (AS 22) entitled accounting for taxes on income insofar as it relates to deferred taxation is inconsistent with and ultra vires the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 (the Companies Act), the Incometax Act, 1961 (I.T. Act) and the Constitution of India?	Issue
M s. J.K. Industries Ltd. is a public limited company.	Facts
It was incorporated in 1951.	Facts
It carries on the business of manufacture and sale of automotive tyres, tubes, sugar and agrigenetics.	Facts
It has a registered office at Calcutta.	Facts
It seeks to challenge AS 22 issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (for short, Institute) which has been made mandatory for all companies listed in Stock Exchanges in India in preparation of their accounts for the financial year 200102 onwards.	Facts
On 7.12.06 the Central Government prescribed AS 22 under Section 211 (3C) of the Companies Act by the Companies (AS) Rules 2006.	Facts
Before that date, AS 22, when issued in 2001, was challenged in writ petitions filed before Madras, Karnataka, Calcutta and Gujarat High Courts.	Facts
On transfer petitions, under Section 139A of the Constitution, filed by the Institute, this Court vide order dated 17.2.03 was pleased to transfer the writ petitions filed in various High Courts to the Calcutta High Court.	Facts
Meaning and purpose of AS In its origin, Accounting Standard is a policy statement or document framed by Institute.	Facts
Accounting Standards establishes rules relating to recognition, measurement and disclosures thereby ensuring that all enterprises that follow them are comparable and that their financial statements are true, fair and transparent.	Facts
Accounting Standards (A.S. for short) are based on a number of accounting principles.	None
They seek to arrive at true accounting income.	Facts
One such principle is the matching principle.	Facts
The other is fair value principle.	Facts
The aim of the Institute is to go for paradigm shift from matching to fair value principle.	Facts
Today the revised Accounting Standards seeks to arrive at true accounting income.	None
In the age of globalization the attempt is to reconcile the accounts of Indian companies with their joint venture partners abroad.	Facts
The aim is to harmonise Indian Accounting Standards with International Accounting Standards.	Facts
With the object of bridging gap between IAS and IFRS, the Institute formulated new A.S. and introduced new concepts, e.g., Deferred Tax Accounting (AS 22 impugned herein), Segment Reporting (AS 17) etc	Facts
However, as a matter of prudence and necessary adjustment, to arrive at real income, Accounting Standards require provision to be made for liabilities payable in future, provision to be made for contingencies, provision to be made for diminution, provision to reflect impairment and so on which have the effect of reducing incomes and were, therefore, not readily accepted by some enterprises and tax authorities.	Facts
The core of Accountancy is Bookkeeping.	None
The rules of Bookkeeping are clear.	Facts
For example, the value of a fixed asset mentioned in a Balance Sheet is based on cost which may involve subjective estimation of the amount to be apportioned.	Facts
Similarly, the quantum of depreciation is again an estimate, which can vary depending on the persons preparing the accounts as to when and at what stage he wants to record the depreciation.	Facts
Accounting Standards are an attempt to overcome some of these deficiencies of Accountancy.	Facts
Accounting Standards involve codification of fundamental accounting rules, rules which explain and standardize the application of the fundamental rules to a variety of uncertain situations like  retirement, contingencies, intangibles, consolidation, merger etc.	Facts
Accounting Standards basically attempt to reduce the subjectivity and lay down rules so as to arrive at the best possible estimates.	Facts
For example, net assets refer to the difference between total assets less liabilities but the value attributable to each asset and each liability is often subjective.	Facts
It depends on estimates.	Facts
This is where the Accounting Standards help.	Facts
They reduce the subjectivity.	Facts
Therefore, Accounting Standards help to arrive at the best possible estimates.	Facts
This estimation subjectivity is also on account of the conceptual difference between accounting income and taxable income.	None
Accounting income is the real income.	Facts
Tax laws lay down rules for valuation of inventories, fixed assets, depreciation, bad debts, etc. based on artificial rules and not on the basis of accounting estimates, which results in mismatch between accounting and taxable incomes.	Facts
For example, a fixed rate of depreciation may, for some companies, result in computing lower than the actual income if the actual erosion in the value of the asset is lower than the depreciation calculated at the fixed rate and higher than actual income for others where assets erode faster.	Facts
Accounting income is normally used as a relevant measure by most stakeholders.	Facts
However, on account of artificial set of rules used in computation of taxable income one finds that accounting income differs from taxable income.	Facts
Looking to these problems, the evolution of Accounting Standards and their greater application is necessary as it results in reducing the need for tax laws to depend upon artificial rules.	Facts
The object of Accounting Standards is, therefore, to standardize and to narrow down the options.	Facts
The object of Accounting Standards is to evolve methods by which accounting income is determined.	Facts
The object behind the Accounting Standards is to evolve methods by which accounting income is determined, made more transparent and leave less and less room for subjective selection of methods and provide for more attention to the quality of estimates used in arriving at accounting income.	Facts
The main object sought to be achieved by Accounting Standards which is now made mandatory is to see that accounting income is adopted as taxable income and not merely as the basis from which taxable income is to be computed.	Facts
Thus, if the rules by which inventories are to be valued are laid down in the Accounting Standards and are followed in the determination of accounting income, then tax laws do not need to lay down the rules and the tax authorities do not need to examine the computation of the value of inventories and its effect on computation of income.	Facts
Similarly, if there is an accounting standard on depreciation which requires estimation of the useful life and prescribes the appropriate method for apportionment of cost of fixed assets over their useful life, it is unnecessary for tax laws to apply an artificial rule to decide the extent of allowance for depreciation.	Facts
Finally, the adoption of Accounting Standards and of accounting income as taxable income would avoid distortion of accounting income which is the real income.	None
Reasons for introducing AS 22 In the backdrop of globalization and liberalization the world has become an economic village.	None
Today, the capital market all over the world knows no barriers.	None
Fiscal distances and barriers have been removed by developments in transport, communication and ecommerce.	None
In this backdrop, Convergence of Accounting Standards is aimed at removing barriers in the flow of financial information and capital.	None
Based on the above developments in the global economy and the Indian economy, the conceptual differences and consequent deviations in the National Accounting Standards and IFRS have got to be eliminated.	None
For example, exchange difference in respect of unpaid liability for acquisition of an imported asset has been allowed in the past to be adjusted with the carrying costs of the fixed assets instead of recognizing the exchange difference in the profit and loss account.	None
Lastly, it is important to note that Accounting Standards and taxation of income are two independent subjects.	None
The object behind AS is to remove this divergence by making Accounting Income a Taxable Income.	None
Accounting income can never negate True Income.	None

None
Analysing the above provisions of the Companies Act the position is that at every AGM of a company the Board of Directors is required to place before it a balancesheet and a PL a c for the financial year.	None
Section 210 of the Companies Act requires a company to place before AGM, a balancesheet and a PL a c for the relevant period.	None
The function of a balancesheet is to show the share capital, reserves and liabilities of the company at the date on which it is prepared and the manner in which the total moneys representing them are distributed over several types of assets.	None
A balancesheet is a historical document.	None
As a general rule it does not show the net worth of an undertaking at any particular date.	None
It does not show the present realizable value of goodwill, land, plant and machinery etc.	None
It also does not show the realizable value of stockintrade, except in cases where the realizable value of stockintrade is less than cost.	None
Therefore, it cannot be said that the balancesheet shows the true financial position.	None
Section 210A was inserted by Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999 with effect from 31.10.98 to provide for constitution of National Advisory Committee (NAC) on Accounting Standards.	None
The said NAC was constituted to advice the Central Government on the formation and laying down of accounting policies and Accounting Standards for adoption by companies or class of companies.	None
The accounting policies and Accounting Standards were required to be prescribed by the Central Government as contemplated by Section 2(33).	None
The object behind Section 210A was to make it obligatory on the part of the companies to comply with the Accounting Standards.	None
NAC was constituted vide Notification dated 18.9.03.	None
Under Section 211(3C)	None
it is provided, that till such time the Accounting Standards are prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with NAC on Accounting Standards the Accounting Standards prescribed by the Institute shall be deemed to be the Accounting Standards to be complied with by all the companies.	None
In all, the Institute has so far framed 29 Accounting Standards.	None
Section 211(1) requires the balancesheet to be in the form set out in Part I of Schedule VI or as near thereto as circumstances admit.	None
The said phrase or as near thereto as circumstances admit allows adoption of improved techniques in the presentation of accounts to shareholders.	None
It is important to note that the information which is required to be given to shareholders pursuant to Schedule VI should be given in a manner which they will understand and which must give a true and fair view of the companys affairs as also it must give a proper picture of the companys profits(losses) for the relevant year.	None
By Companies (Amendment) Act, 1999, subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) as well as a proviso thereto stood inserted in Section 211 of the Companies Act w.e.f. 31.10.98 in order to provide for compliance of Accounting Standards by companies in the preparation of PL a c and balancesheet.	None
By virtue of the said amendment, Accounting Standards are required to be prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with the NAC established under Section 210A. Until the NAC is established and Accounting Standards are prescribed by the Central Government, the Accounting Standards specified by the Institute shall be followed by all the companies.	None
In the present case, the NAC has been established.	None
In the present case, by the impugned notification dated 7.12.06, the Accounting Standards have been prescribed by the Central Government.	None
In the present case, by the impugned notification, AS 22 earlier specified by the Institute has been adopted by the Central Government in the form of a Rule.	None
Therefore, vide the impugned notification, AS 22 stands prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with NAC which has been established under Section 210A of the Companies Act.	None
It is made clear that the Accounting Standards prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with NAC need not be identical with the Accounting Standards specified by the Institute.	None
In the present case, the impugned notification indicates that the Central Government has been given the authority to enact a Rule and accordingly the rulemaking authority, namely, the Central Government has prescribed the Accounting Standard No.22 in consultation with NAC by adopting AS 22 originally specified by the Institute.	None
Under Section 211(1) every balancesheet of a company has to comply with the following requirements It must give true and fair view of the affairs of the company at the end of the financial year it must be in the form set out in Part I of Schedule VI or as near thereto as circumstances admit and it must give regard to the general instructions for preparation of balancesheet under the heading 023Notes024.	None
17.	None
Similarly, Section 211(2) of the Companies Act requires that every PL a c of a company must give a true and fair view of the profit or loss of the company for the financial year and comply with the requirements of Part II of Schedule VI so far as they are applicable thereto.	None
It may be noted that the balancesheet prescribed by Part I of Schedule VI has to be in the form of a proforma.	None
However, the Companies Act does not prescribe a proforma of PL a c. Part I of Schedule VI prescribes a proforma of balancesheet.	None
Part II of Schedule VI only prescribes the particulars which must be furnished in the PL a c.	None
Therefore, as far as possible, the PL a c must be drawn up according to the requirements of Part II of Schedule VI.	None
It is important to note that Section 211 read with Part I and Part II of Schedule VI prescribes the form and contents of balancesheet and PL a c.	None
However, Section 211(1), inter alia, states that every balancesheet of a company shall subject to the provisions of that section, be in the form set out in Part I of Schedule VI.	None
The words 023subject to the provisions of this section024 would mean that every subsection following subsection (1) including subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) shall have an overriding effect and consequently every PL a c and balancesheet shall comply with the Accounting Standards.	None
Therefore, implementation of the Accounting Standards and their compliance are made compulsory and mandatory by the aforestated subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C).	None
The insertion of the concept of 023true and fair view024 in place of 023true and correct024 has been made to do away with the view that accounts should disclose arithmetically accuracy.	None
Adherence to the disclosure requirements as per Schedule VI is subservient to the overriding requirement of 023true and fair view024 as regards the state of affairs.	None
Therefore, the annual financial statements should convey an overall fair view and should not give any misleading information or impression.	None
All the relevant information should be disclosed in the balancesheet and the PL a c in such a manner that the financial position and the working results are shown as they are.	None
There should be neither an overstatement nor an understatement.	None
Further, the information to be disclosed should be in consonance with the fundamental accounting assumptions and commonly accepted accounting policies.	None
Therefore, failure to make provision for taxation would not disclose true and fair view of the state of affairs.	None
Noncompliance for taxation would, therefore, amount to contravention of Sections 209 and 211 of the Companies Act.	None
Accordingly, it is necessary for the auditor to qualify in his report, and such qualification should bring out in what manner the accounts do not disclose a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company as well as the profit loss of the company.	None
Several Accounting Standards prescribed by the Institute have been made mandatory.	None
The Institute has, however, clarified that the expression 023mandatory in nature024 implies that while discharging their functions, it will be the duty of the Chartered Accountants who are members of the Institute to examine whether the said Accounting Standard has been complied with in the presentation of financial statements covered by their audit (See Section 227(3)(d)).	None
In this regard it may be noted that under Section 227(3)(d)	None
it is the duty of the auditor, to state in his audit report whether the PL a c and the balancesheet complies with the Accounting Standards referred to in Section 211(3C).	Reasoning
Before introduction of subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) in Section 211 (w.e.f. 31.10.98), these Standards were not mandatory.	None
Therefore, the companies were then free to prepare their annual financial statements, as per the specific requirements of Section 211 read with Schedule VI.	None
However, with the insertion of subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) in Section 211 the PL a c and the balancesheet have to comply with the Accounting Standards.	None
For this purpose the expression 023Accounting Standards024 shall mean the standards of accounting recommended by the Institute as may be prescribed by the Central Government in consultation with NAC on Accounting Standards.	None
Thus, the Accounting Standards are prescribed by the Central Government.	None
Thus, the Accounting Standards prescribed by the Central Government are now mandatory qua the companies and noncompliance with these Standards would lead to violation of Section 211 inasmuch as the annual accounts may then not be regarded as showing a 023true and fair view024. 18.	None
Section 641 empowers the Central Government to alter any of the regulations, rules, tables, forms and other provisions contained in Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, this power can be used only for making simple alterations which will not affect the legislative policies enshrined in the Companies Act.	None
19.	None
Section 642 refers to the powers of the Central Government to make rules.	None
It states that in addition to the powers conferred by Section 641, the Central Government may, by notification in the official gazette, make rules for all or any of the matters which by the Companies Act are to be prescribed by the Central Government and to carry out the purposes of the Companies Act.	None
Therefore, Section 641 and Section 642 form part of the same scheme.	None
Under Section 642, the Central Government exercises power of delegated legislation by prescribing rules.	None
Under various provisions of the Act, Rules are to be prescribed.	None
Rules can also be prescribed vide clause (b) to Section 642(1) to carry out the purposes of the Act.	None
In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (a) to subsection (1) of Section 642 of the Companies Act read with subsection (3C) of Section 211 and Section 210A(1), the Central Government in consultation with NAC on Accounting Standards has made the following Rules vide the impugned notification dated 7.12.06.

Secy.ANNEXURE(See rule 3)ACCOUNTING STANDARDSGeneral Instructions1.	None
SMCs shall follow the following instructions while complying with Accounting Standards under these rules1.1 the SMC which does not disclose certain information pursuant to the exemptions or relaxations given to it shall disclose (by way of a note to its financial statements) the fact that it is an SMC and has complied with the Accounting Standards insofar as they are applicable to an SMC on the following linesThe Company is a Small and Medium Sized Company (SMC) as defined in the General Instructions in respect of Accounting Standards notified under the Companies Act, 1956.	None
Accordingly, the Company has complied with the Accounting Standards as applicable to a Small and Medium Sized Company.1.2.	None
Where a company, being a SMC, has qualified for any exemption or relaxation previously but no longer qualifies for the relevant exemption or relaxation in the current accounting period, the relevant standards or requirements become applicable from the current period and the figures for the corresponding period of the previous accounting period need not be revised merely by reason of its having ceased to be an SMC.	None
The fact that the company was an SMC in the previous period and it had availed of the exemptions or relaxations available to SMCs shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.1.3	None
If an SMC opts not to avail of the exemptions or relaxations available to an SMC in respect of any but not all of the Accounting Standards, it shall disclose the standard(s) in respect of which it has availed the exemption or relaxation.1.4	None
If an SMC desires to disclose the information not required to be disclosed pursuant to the exemptions or relaxations available to the SMCs, it shall disclose that information in compliance with the relevant accounting standard.1.5.	None
The SMC may opt for availing certain exemptions or relaxations from compliance with the requirements prescribed in an Accounting StandardProvided that such a partial exemption or relaxation and disclosure shall not be permitted to mislead any person or public.2.	None
Accounting Standards, which are prescribed, are intended to be in conformity with the provisions of applicable laws.	None
However, if due to subsequent amendments in the law, a particular accounting standard is found to be not in conformity with such law, the provisions of the said law will prevail and the financial statements shall be prepared in conformity with such law.3.	None
Accounting Standards are intended to apply only to items which are material.4.	None
The accounting standards include paragraphs set in bold italic type and plain type, which have equal authority.	None
Paragraphs in bold italic type indicate the main principles.	None
An individual accounting standard shall be read in the context of the objective, if stated, in that accounting standard and in accordance with these General Instructions.	None
Accounting Standard (AS) 22 Accounting for Taxes on Income(This Accounting Standard includes paragraphs set in bold italic type and plain type, which have equal authority.	None
Paragraphs in bold italic type indicate the main principles.	None
This Accounting Standard should be read in the context of its objective and the General Instructions contained in part A of the Annexure to the Notification.)ObjectiveThe objective of this Standard is to prescribe accounting treatment for taxes on income.	None
Taxes on income is one of the significant items in the statement of profit and loss of an enterprise.	None
In accordance with the matching concept, taxes on income are accrued in the same period as the revenue and expenses to which they relate.	None
Matching of such taxes against revenue for a period poses special problems arising from the fact that in a number of cases, taxable income may be significantly different from the accounting income.	None
This divergence between taxable income and accounting income arises due to two main reasons.	None
Firstly, there are differences between items of revenue and expenses as appearing in the statement of profit and loss and the items which are considered as revenue, expenses or deductions for tax purposes.	None
Secondly, there are differences between the amount in respect of a particular item of revenue or expense as recognised in the statement of profit and loss and Scope1.	None
This Standard should be applied in accounting for taxes on income.	None
This includes the determination of the amount of the expense or saving related to taxes on income in respect of an accounting period and the disclosure of such an amount in the financial statements.2.	None
For the purposes of this Standard, taxes on income include all domestic and foreign taxes which are based on taxable income.3.	None
This Standard does not specify when, or how, an enterprise should account for taxes that are payable on distribution of dividends and other distributions made by the enterprise.	None
Definitions4.	None
For the purpose of this Standard, the following terms are used with the meanings specified4.1 Accounting income (loss) is the net profit or loss for a period, as reported in the statement of profit and loss, before deducting income tax expense or adding income tax saving.4.2	None
Taxable income (tax loss) is the amount of the income (loss) for a period, determined in accordance with the tax laws, based upon which income tax payable (recoverable) is determined.4.3 Tax expense (tax saving) is the aggregate of current tax and deferred tax charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss for the period.4.4 Current tax is the amount of income tax determined to be payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable income (tax loss) for a period.4.5 Deferred tax is the tax effect of timing differences.4.6	None
Timing differences are the differences between taxable income and accounting income for a period that originate in one period and are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.4.7 Permanent differences are the differences between taxable income and accounting income for a period that originate in one period and do not reverse subsequently.5.	None
Taxable income is calculated in accordance with tax laws.	None
In some circumstances, the requirements of these laws to compute taxable income differ from the accounting policies applied to determine accounting income.	None
The effect of this difference is that the taxable income and accounting income may not be the same.6.	None
The differences between taxable income and accounting income can be classified into permanent differences and timing differences.	None
Permanent differences are those differences between taxable income and accounting income which originate in one period and do not reverse subsequently.	None
For instance, if for the purpose of computing taxable income, the tax laws allow only a part of an item of expenditure, the disallowed amount would result in a permanent difference.7.	None
Timing differences are those differences between taxable income and accounting income for a period that originate in one period and are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.	Arguments of Petitioner
Timing differences arise because the period in which some items of revenue and expenses are included in taxable income do not coincide with the period in which such items of revenue and expenses are included or considered in arriving at accounting income.	None
For example, machinery purchased for scientific research related to business is fully allowed as deduction in the first year for tax purposes whereas the same would be charged to the statement of profit and loss as depreciation over its useful life.	None
The total depreciation charged on the machinery for accounting purposes and the amount allowed as deduction for tax purposes will ultimately be the same, but periods over which the depreciation is charged and the deduction is allowed will differ.	None
Another example of timing difference is a situation where, for the purpose of computing taxable income, tax laws allow depreciation on the basis of the written down value method, whereas for accounting purposes, straight line method is used.	None
Some other examples of timing differences arising under the Indian tax laws are given in Illustration I.8.	None
Unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses which can be setoff against future taxable income are also considered as timing differences and result in deferred tax assets, subject to consideration of prudence (see paragraphs 1518).Recognition9.	None
Tax expense for the period, comprising current tax and deferred tax, should be included in the determination of the net profit or loss for the period.10.	None
Taxes on income are considered to be an expense incurred by the enterprise in earning income and are accrued in the same period as the revenue and expenses to which they relate.	None
Such matching may result into timing differences.	None
The tax effects of timing differences are included in the tax expense in the statement of profit and loss and as deferred tax assets (subject to the consideration of prudence as set out in paragraphs 1518) or as deferred tax liabilities, in the balance sheet.11.	None
An example of tax effect of a timing difference that results in a deferred tax asset is an expense provided in the statement of profit and loss but not allowed as a deduction under Section 43B of the Incometax Act, 1961.	None
This timing difference will reverse when the deduction of that expense is allowed under Section 43B in subsequent year(s).	None
An example of tax effect of a timing difference resulting in a deferred tax liability is the higher charge of depreciation allowable under the Incometax Act, 1961, compared to the depreciation provided in the statement of profit and loss.	None
In subsequent years, the differential will reverse when comparatively lower depreciation will be allowed for tax purposes.12.	None
Permanent differences do not result in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.13.	None
Deferred tax should be recognised for all the timing differences, subject to the consideration of prudence in respect of deferred tax assets as set out in paragraphs 1518.Explanation(a)	None
The deferred tax in respect of timing differences which reverse during the tax holiday period is not recognised to the extent the enterprises gross total income is subject to the deduction during the tax holiday period as per the requirements of sections 80IA/80 IB of the Incometax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act).	None
In case of sections 10A/10B of the Act (covered under Chapter III of the Act dealing with incomes which do not form part of total income), the deferred tax in respect of timing differences which reverse during the tax holiday period is not recognised to the extent deduction from the total income of an enterprise is allowed during the tax holiday period as per the provisions of the said sections.(b) Deferred tax in respect of timing differences which reverse after the tax holiday period is recognised in the year in which the timing differences originate.	None
However, recognition of deferred tax assets is subject to the consideration of prudence as laid down in paragraphs 15 to 18.(c)	None
For the above purposes, the timing differences which originate first are considered to reverse first.	None
The application of the above explanation is illustrated in the Illustration attached to the Standard.14.	None
This Standard requires recognition of deferred tax for all the timing differences.	None
This is based on the principle that the financial statements for a period should recognise the tax effect, whether current or deferred, of all the transactions occurring in that period.15.	None
Except in the situations stated in paragraph 17, deferred tax assets should be recognised and carried forward only to the extent that there is a reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.16.	None
While recognising the tax effect of timing differences, consideration of prudence cannot be ignored.	None
Therefore, deferred tax assets are recognised and carried forward only to the extent that there is a reasonable certainty of their realisation.	None
This reasonable level of certainty would normally be achieved by examining the past record of the enterprise and by making realistic estimates of profits for the future.17.	None
Where an enterprise has unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses under tax laws, deferred tax assets should be recognised only to the extent that there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.	None
Explanation1.	None
Determination of virtual certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available is a matter of judgement based on convincing evidence and will have to be evaluated on a case to case basis.	None
Virtual certainty refers to the extent of certainty, which, for all practical purposes, can be considered certain.	None
Virtual certainty cannot be based merely on forecasts of performance such as business plans.	None
Virtual certainty is not a matter of perception and is to be supported by convincing evidence.	None
Evidence is a matter of fact.	None
To be convincing, the evidence should be available at the reporting date in a concrete form, for example, a profitable binding export order, cancellation of which will result in payment of heavy damages by the defaulting party.	None
On the other hand, a projection of the future profits made by an enterprise based on the future capital expenditures or future restructuring etc., submitted even to an outside agency, e.g., to a credit agency for obtaining loans and accepted by that agency cannot, in isolation, be considered as convincing evidence.2(a) As per the relevant provisions of the Incometax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), the loss arising under the head Capital gains can be carried forward and setoff in future years, only against the income arising under that head as per the requirements of the Act.(b) Where an enterprises statement of profit and loss includes an item of loss which can be setoff in future for taxation purposes, only against the income arising under the head Capital gains as per the requirements of the Act, that item is a timing difference to the extent it is not setoff in the current year and is allowed to be setoff against the income arising under the head Capital gains in subsequent years subject to the provisions of the Act.	None
In respect of such loss, deferred tax asset is recognised and carried forward subject to the consideration of prudence.	None
Accordingly, in respect of such loss, deferred tax asset is recognised and carried forward only to the extent that there is a virtual certainty, supported by convincing evidence, that sufficient future taxable income will be available under the head Capital gains against which the loss can be setoff as per the provisions of the Act.	None
Whether the test of virtual certainty is fulfilled or not would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.	None
The examples of situations in which the test of virtual certainty, supported by convincing evidence, for the purposes of the recognition of deferred tax asset in respect of loss arising under the head Capital gains is normally fulfilled, are sale of an asset giving rise to capital gain (eligible to setoff the capital loss as per the provisions of the Act) after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are approved, and binding sale agreement which will give rise to capital gain (eligible to setoff the capital loss as per the provisions of the Act).(c)	None
In cases where there is a difference between the amounts of loss recognised for accounting purposes and tax purposes because of cost indexation under the Act in respect of longterm capital assets, the deferred tax asset is recognised and carried forward (subject to the consideration of prudence) on the amount which can be carried forward and setoff in future ears as per the provisions of the Act.18.	None
The existence of unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses under tax laws is strong evidence that future taxable income may not be available.	None
Therefore, when an enterprise has a history of recent losses, the enterprise recognises deferred tax assets only to the extent that it has timing differences the reversal of which will result in sufficient income or there is other convincing evidence that sufficient taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.	None
In such circumstances, the nature of the evidence supporting its recognition is disclosed.	None
Reassessment of Unrecognised Deferred Tax Assets19.	None
At each balance sheet date, an enterprise reassesses unrecognised deferred tax assets.	None
The enterprise recognises previously unrecognised deferred tax assets to the extent that it has become reasonably certain or virtually certain, as the case may be (see paragraphs 15 to 18), that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which such deferred tax assets can be realised.	None
For example, an improvement in trading conditions may make it reasonably certain that the enterprise will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future.	None
Measurement20.	None
Current tax should be measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, using the applicable tax rates and tax laws.21.	None
Deferred tax assets and liabilities should be measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.	None
Explanation(a)	None
The payment of tax under section 115JB of the Incometax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) is a current tax for the period.(b)	None
In a period in which a company pays tax under section 115JB of the Act, the deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of timing differences arising during the period, tax effect of which is required to be recognised under this Standard, is measured using the regular tax rates and not the tax rate under section 115JB of the Act.(c)	None
In case an enterprise expects that the timing differences arising in the current period would reverse in a period in which it may pay tax under section 115JB of the Act, the deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of timing differences arising during the current period, tax effect of which is required to be recognised under AS 22, is measured using the regular tax rates and not the tax rate under section 115JB of the Act.22.	None
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are usually measured using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted.	None
However, certain announcements of tax rates and tax laws by the government may have the substantive effect of actual enactment.	None
In these circumstances, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using such announced tax rate and tax laws.23.	None
When different tax rates apply to different levels of taxable income, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using average rates.24.	None
Deferred tax assets and liabilities should not be discounted to their present value.25.	None
The reliable determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities on a discounted basis requires detailed scheduling of the timing of the reversal of each timing difference.	None
In a number of cases such scheduling is impracticable or highly complex.	None
Therefore, it is inappropriate to require discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.	None
To permit, but not to require, discounting would result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which would not be comparable between enterprises.	None
Therefore, this Standard does not require or permit the discounting of deferred tax assets and liabilities.	None
Review of Deferred Tax Assets26.	None
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets should be reviewed at each balance sheet date.	None
An enterprise should writedown the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer reasonably certain or virtually certain, as the case may be (see paragraphs 15 to 18), that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which deferred tax asset can be realised.	None
Any such writedown may be reversed to the extent that it becomes reasonably certain or virtually certain, as the case may be (see paragraphs 15 to 18), that sufficient future taxable income will be available.	None
Presentation and Disclosure27.	None
An enterprise should offset assets and liabilities representing current tax if the enterprise(a) has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and(b) intends to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.28.	None
An enterprise will normally have a legally enforceable right to set off an asset and liability representing current tax when they relate to income taxes levied under the same governing taxation laws and the taxation laws permit the enterprise to make or receive a single net payment.29.	None
An enterprise should offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if(a) the enterprise has a legally enforceable right to set off assets against liabilities representing current tax and(b) the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.30.	None
Deferred tax assets and liabilities should be distinguished from assets and liabilities representing current tax for the period.	None
Deferred tax assets and liabilities should be disclosed under a separate heading in the balance sheet of the enterprise, separately from current assets and current liabilities.	None
ExplanationDeferred tax assets (net of the deferred tax liabilities, if any, in accordance with paragraph 29) is disclosed on the face of the balance sheet separately after the head Investments and deferred tax liabilities (net of the deferred tax assets, if any, in accordance with paragraph 29) is disclosed on the face of the balance sheet separately after the head Unsecured Loans.31.	None
The breakup of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities into major components of the respective balances should be disclosed in the notes to accounts.32.	None
The nature of the evidence supporting the recognition of deferred tax assets should be disclosed, if an enterprise has unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses under tax laws.	None
Transitional Provisions33.	None
On the first occasion that the taxes on income are accounted for in accordance with this Standard, the enterprise should recognise, in the financial statements, the deferred tax balance that has accumulated prior to the adoption of this Standard as deferred tax asset liability with a corresponding credit charge to the revenue reserves, subject to the consideration of prudence in case of deferred tax assets (see paragraphs 1518).	None
The amount so credited charged to the revenue reserves should be the same as that which would have resulted if this Standard had been in effect from the beginning.34.	None
For the purpose of determining accumulated deferred tax in the period in which this Standard is applied for the first time, the opening balances of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and for tax purposes are compared and the differences, if any, are determined.	None
The tax effects of these differences, if any, should be recognised as deferred tax assets or liabilities, if these differences are timing differences.	None
For example, in the year in which an enterprise adopts this Standard, the opening balance of a fixed asset is Rs. 100 for accounting purposes and Rs. 60 for tax purposes.	None
The difference is because the enterprise applies written down value method of depreciation for calculating taxable income whereas for accounting purposes straight line method is used.	None
This difference will reverse in future when depreciation for tax purposes will be lower as compared to the depreciation for accounting purposes.	None
In the above case, assuming that enacted tax rate for the year is 40 and that there are no other timing differences, deferred tax liability of Rs. 16 (Rs. 100  Rs. 60) x 40 would be recognised.	None
Another example is an expenditure that has already been written off for accounting purposes in the year of its incurrance but is allowable for tax purposes over a period of time.	None
In this case, the asset representing that expenditure would have a balance only for tax purposes but not for accounting purposes.	None
The difference between balance of the asset for tax purposes and the balance (which is nil) for accounting purposes would be a timing difference which will reverse in future when this expenditure would be allowed for tax purposes.	None
Therefore, a deferred tax asset would be recognised in respect of this difference subject to the consideration of prudence (see paragraphs 15  18).	None
Submissions Dr. D. Pal, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of M s. Simplex Infrastructures Ltd. and Anr., submitted that under para 9 of AS 22 tax expense for the period, comprising current tax and deferred tax, is now required to be included in the determination of net profit (loss) for that period.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, deferred tax is now defined under the said AS 22 to mean the tax effect of timing differences.	Arguments of Petitioner
Timing difference in turn is defined to mean the difference between the taxable income and the accounting income for a period that originates in one period and is capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, DTL along with current tax liability (CTL) are now required to be included in the determination of the net profit (loss) for the period.	Arguments of Petitioner
This inclusion of DTL along with CTL in the determination of the net profit (loss), according to learned counsel, is repugnant to Part II of clause 3(vi) of Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, learned counsel urged that under the said Part II only the tax liability of the relevant accounting year can be charged to PL	Arguments of Petitioner
a c. Therefore, clause 9, insofar as it provides for the inclusion of DTL in the determination of the net profit (loss) is contrary to and inconsistent with Part II of clause 3(vi) of Schedule VI.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, DTL as an element of PL a c is not mentioned in the form prescribed for the balancesheet or the PL a c	Arguments of Petitioner
but it is made substantive provision by para 9 by making it a charge on the PL a c and thus resulting in enhancement of tax liability for the year.	None
Learned counsel further contended that Section 211(1) of the Companies Act lays down that every balancesheet of a company shall give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company at the end of the financial year and shall subject to the provisions of the said section, be in the form set out in Part I of Schedule VI or as near thereto as circumstances admit or in such other form as may be approved by the Central Government.	None
According to learned counsel, Section 211(1) of the Companies Act should be read with the proviso which inter alia provides that nothing contained in Section 211(1) shall apply to insurance company, banking company, electricity company etc. for which a separate balancesheet has been specified in the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, according to learned counsel, what is contemplated by the expression subject to the provisions of Section 211 is that where there is inconsistency or conflict between the other provisions of Section 211, the other provision will prevail as there are circumstances when insurance and banking company or any company for which a form or balancesheet has been specified under the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, according to learned counsel, because Section 211 is subject to the said provision, the provision contained in the proviso shall apply whenever there is any inconsistency or conflict between Section 211(1) and the proviso.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel next contended that the impugned rule has been framed in exercise of power under Section 642 of the Companies Act.	None
Therefore, Accounting Standard has been prescribed by the rules framed under that Section.	Arguments of Petitioner
The rules so framed are placed before the Parliament.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, Section 642(1) has not the effect as if it is enacted in the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, on the other hand, under Section 641(1) the Central Government has been given the power to alter any of the existing regulations, rules, tables or forms or any of the schedules to the Act including Schedule VI.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, any alteration notified in Section 641(1) has the effect as if enacted in the Act and shall come into force on the date of the notification unless the notification otherwise directs.	Arguments of Petitioner
These rules are also required to be placed before the Parliament.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, Schedule VI can be amended or altered by a notification issued under Section 641(1) of the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
If Schedule VI is not altered or amended in exercise of power under Section 641(1) of the said Act, then, Schedule VI being part of the Act, the rule adopting the AS under Section 642(1) of the Act cannot modify or amend the provisions of Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, learned counsel urged that AS 22 has now been prescribed by the rules framed under Section 641(1) of the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, it runs counter to or inconsistent with Schedule VI to the Companies Act and consequently it amounts to excessive exercise of the powers conferred under Section 211 read with Section 642(1) of the Companies Act as well as in excess of the provisions of Sections 209, 211 and Schedule VI to the Companies Act and is ultra vires the said Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
In other words, learned counsel submitted that Section 641 empowers the Central Government to amend Schedule VI but Section 642 does not confer any such power.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, if Schedule VI is amended under Section 641 the amendment will have the effect as if enacted in the Act and the schedule so amended under Section 641 of the Act becomes part of the Act but that is not the case where AS is prescribed by the rules under Section 641(1) of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel, therefore, submitted that Accounting Standard, as prescribed by the rules under Section 642(1) of the Act run contrary to or being inconsistent with Schedule VI of the Companies Act without any amendment being made under Section 641(1) of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, rules framed under Section 642(1) of the Act do not have any effect as if enacted in the Companies Act that, the effect of amendment of schedule under Section 641 is as if enacted in the Act but rules framed under Section 642 do not have that effect.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the effect of the notifications under Section 641 on the one hand and the notifications issued under Section 642 on the other hand is entirely different.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to learned counsel, so long as Schedule VI to the Companies Act is not altered or amended by exercising the power under Section 641(1) of the Act the AS prescribed by the rules notified under Section 642(1) cannot alter or amend Schedule VI and if the said rules are contrary to or inconsistent with Schedule VI then the same are liable to be struck down as inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel further submitted that in any case the requirement of maintaining accounts on accrual basis and on double entry system of accounting as required under Section 209 of the Companies Act is mandatory and it is not subject to any provisions of Section 211 of the Companies Act.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the rule prescribing AS 22 under Section 642(1) is not only contrary to and inconsistent with Section 209 but also with Schedule VI to the Companies Act insofar as it requires the DTL to be included in the determination of net profit (loss) for the current year.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, it is in excess of the provisions of Section 209 and Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, if the accounts are to be maintained on accrual basis, DTL cannot be considered as an accrued liability.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, the requirements of giving true and fair view can be made only on accrual basis and on double entry system of accounting.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, if DTL is a notional and contingent liability, it cannot be charged to the PL a c. It can only be disclosed by way of a Note in the balancesheet and PL a c which will give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company.	Arguments of Petitioner
Lastly, learned counsel submitted that clause 33 of AS 22 gives a retrospective effect to the transactions which have taken place much earlier and in respect of which the DTL is to be calculated as if the said AS 22 has been in effect from the beginning and the entire amount of such DTL is now required to be provided for in the opening balance of the year in which AS 22 has been given effect to i.e. in the year 2001.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Arvind P. Datar, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of M s. First Leasing Company of India Ltd., submitted that AS 22 is a subordinate legislation.	Arguments of Respondent
It cannot be contrary to the provisions of the parent Act, namely, Companies Act, 1956 and, in particular, Sections 205, 209, Schedule VI and Schedule XIV thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the learned counsel, AS 22 is ultra vires the rule making power conferred by Section 642 to the extent it seeks to create a fictional tax liability.	Arguments of Respondent
According to learned counsel, AS 22 is also ultra vires as no subordinate legislation can seek to reconcile divergent profits that are arrived at by two independent enactments, namely, accounting or book profits as per the Companies Act and taxable profits under the I.T. Act.	Arguments of Respondent
In this connection, it was urged that all 29 Accounting Standards stood notified by Notification No.739(E) dated 7.12.2006.	Arguments of Respondent
Accordingly, all 29 Accounting Standards are now contained in the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006.	Arguments of Respondent
They have, therefore, the status of subordinate legislation.	Arguments of Respondent
That, para 2 of the Annexure to the Accounting Standards has expressly stated that the Standards are intended to be in conformity with the provisions of applicable laws and, therefore, according to learned counsel, the intention is not to treat the Accounting Standards as part of the Companies Act but as a subordinate legislation.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, AS 22 cannot be treated as amending or altering Schedule VI which is part of the Companies Act and which can only be done under Section 641(2) by way of appropriate notification.	Arguments of Respondent
That, under Section 641(2), any amendment to the schedules by way of notification is treated as if it is enacted in the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Such a provision is absent in Section 642.	Arguments of Respondent
That, as the Accounting Standards in the present case have not been notified under Section 641, they cannot alter or amend the Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	Arguments of Respondent
As regards matching principle, learned counsel submitted that the said principle has to be applied in two ways on revenue basis and on time basis That, the said principle can be applied for both the profits, namely, accounting profits and taxable profits.	None
That, broadly speaking, the matching principle can be applied by matching expenditure against specific revenues as having been used in generating those specific revenues or by matching expenses against the revenues of a given period in general on the basis that the expenditure pertains to that period.	None
The former is termed as matching principle on revenue basis and the latter is termed as matching principle on time basis.	None
According to learned counsel, the said principle applies only where the assessee has a choice of debiting or crediting expenditure or income in a particular financial year (time basis) or for correlating a particular expenditure against particular revenue (revenue basis).	None
That, matching principle cannot be extrapolated to divergent results that arise under two statues and, therefore, Accounting Profits and Taxable Profits computed under the Companies Act and the I.T. Act respectively cannot be reconciled by applying the matching principle or on the basis of effect of Time Differences.	None
In this connection, learned counsel pointed out that in India the timing difference arises mainly because different rates of depreciation are statutorily prescribed by Schedule XIV to the Companies Act and by Rule 5, AppendixI to the Income Tax Rules.	None
It is submitted that 99 of DTL arises only on account of difference in depreciation rates.	None
This position is not disputed by the Institute.	None
Learned counsel, therefore, urged that if the rates of depreciation are statutorily different, then the Institute or the Central Government, as a rule making authority, has no power to apply the matching principle or timing difference and bring the accounting depreciation in line with tax depreciation.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the Institute as well as the Central Government has erred in prescribing AS 22 as a mandatory rule to bring about a reconciliation between tax depreciation and accounting depreciation for which it has no such jurisdiction or power.	None
According to learned counsel, in India, unlike U.K., rates of depreciation are statutorily prescribed.	None
They are separately prescribed under I.T. Act and Companies Act.	None
Therefore, it is only for the court tax department to apply the matching principle in a given case.	None
It would depend on the facts of a given case.	None
The matching principle cannot be prescribed by a rule or an Accounting Standard.	None
Learned counsel, therefore, submitted that the Central Government as a rule making authority under Section 642 or the Institute has no power to apply the matching principle or timing difference across the board to bring the accounting depreciation in line with tax depreciation.	None
The rates of depreciation are not prescribed statutorily in U.K. In U.K. the assessee is at liberty to adopt any rate of depreciation he chooses and, therefore, according to learned counsel, there could be some justification for invoking the matching principle and applying an accounting standard for deferred taxation.	None
On the concept of true and fair view, leaned counsel urged that under Section 211(1), a balancesheet has to present a true and fair view.	None
Similarly, under Section 211(2), PL a c must also be true and fair.	None
However, according to learned counsel, the said concept does not mean that Accounting Standards can alter Schedule VI or enable alteration of accounting profits which have been computed as per Sections 205, 209 read with Schedule VI and Schedule XIV to the Companies Act.	None
Learned counsel further pointed out that in fact under Section 211(5)(v) there is a stipulation that anything not disclosed as per Schedule VI will not render the balancesheet PL a c as not disclosing the true and fair view.	None
On the question of effect of AS 22, learned counsel urged that the effect of implementation of AS 22 would result in drastic reduction in profits of a company.	None
In this connection, learned counsel urged that AS 22 provides for TOI.	None
That, the difference between accounting profit (profit under the Companies Act after providing for depreciation and taxation) and the taxable profit (profit as per I.T. Act) are to be multiplied by the rate of income tax.	None
This amount has to be reduced deducted from the accounting profit.	None
Therefore, the formula would be read as under (APTP) x rate of income tax DTL In other words, if the accounting profit is Rs.50 crores and the taxable profit is Rs.30 crores and the rate of income tax is 30 then DTL will be Rs.6 crores (5030 x 30/100).	None
Similarly, (loss unabsorbed depreciation)	None
x rate of income tax is DTA.	None
If a company has a loss and carry forward depreciation of Rs.40 crores and the rate of income tax is 30 then DTA will be 40 x 30/100 Rs.12 crores In such a case the loss of Rs.40 crores will be reduced to Rs.28 crores (4012).	None
Relying upon the above illustrations, learned counsel submitted that if a company is making accounting profits year after year the said profits will stand reduced year after year by DTL if AS 22 is implemented.	None
Similarly, according to learned counsel, the DTL of each year will become accumulated and shown on the liability side of the balancesheet, below Unsecured Loans.	None
That, this accumulated liability on account of DTL will reduce the networth of a company.	None
On the other hand, DTA has to be shown on the Asset side.	None
But DTA can be claimed as an asset only on the basis of the concept of virtual certainty (See paras 17 and 18 of AS 22).	None
Accordingly, it is urged that profits available for distribution as dividend shall also be reduced between 20 to 30 each year if DTL is shown as accumulated liability.	None
According to learned counsel, the Institute has not produced any evidence of any company getting any benefit from implementation of AS 22.	None
In this connection, learned counsel submitted that provision for DTL unfortunately has not been treated as a reserve which an be utilized in times of financial crisis.	None
That the Institute has not given a single example of a situation where timing difference has been reversed.	None
According to learned counsel, AS 22 does not in any way help collection of higher taxes.	None
That, as long as a company continues to be profitable, it is impossible for any reversal by timing difference.	None
In this connection, learned counsel urged that, in India, income tax depreciation is substantially higher than accounting depreciation as per Schedule XIV and, therefore, the accounting profits will always be more than the book profits.	None
Therefore, every year, there would be DTL which will keep on accumulating.	None
For example, according to learned counsel, accumulated DTL of Reliance Industries Ltd. was Rs.6982 crores as on 31.3.07 and this liability will keep on accumulating.	None
According to learned counsel, except in the case of companies which are likely to make loss in the near future, reversal will never take place.	None
Therefore, the basic stipulation of timing difference getting reversed will never happen.	None
Learned counsel further submitted that DTL is made chargeable to the PL a c even when it is a nonexistent or fictional liability that the amount which is reduced from the profit is not even treated as a reserve and, therefore, DTL cannot be utilized if the company runs into financial difficulty.	None
According to learned counsel, under para 33 of AS 22 companies are required to rework the entire liability from the beginning of the existing assets.	None
For example, in the case of Indian Railway Finance Corporation Ltd., provision is required to be made in respect DTL of Rs. 940.55 crores.	None
The transitional provision took place for the year ended 200102.	None
The said provision of Rs.940.55 crores has diminished Bond Redemption Reserve.	None
Similarly, according to learned counsel, in the case of M s. First Leasing Company of India Ltd., application of para 33, as transitional provision, has resulted in DTL of Rs.62 crores.	None
On the question of legal status of AS 22, learned counsel submitted that the said Standard is a subordinate legislation and, therefore, it cannot create a tax liability.	None
DTL is neither a liability nor a tax.	None
It is not a deferral.	None
That, the levy of tax can either be by the Central Government or State Government under List I or List II of Schedule VII to the Constitution.	None
That, under Article 366(28), taxation includes imposition of any tax or impost.	None
Under Article 265, taxes can be levied only by authority of law.	None
DTL, according to learned counsel, is not a tax by definition or by understanding.	None
It cannot be treated as a tax by any process of interpretation.	None
If it is a tax, it has to be credited to the Consolidated Fund of India State.	None
DTL is also not a fee or a cess or any surcharge.	None
That, under para 3(vi) of Part II of Schedule VI deduction of taxes on income has to be shown.	None
At present, the taxes that can be deducted are Income Tax, Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT), Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).	None
Similarly, any surcharge or cess levied by the Finance Act as a percentage of such taxes will also be deductible.	None
According to learned counsel, gross receipts of any company can be reduced by following items to arrive at profits before taxation.	None
These items are expenses such as salaries, raw materials and overheads liability towards gratuity, PF, etc A tax liability can be created only under an Act of Parliament.	None
DTL can only be a liability by way of tax.	None
It is not a liability of any other nature since it is not required to be discharged in future.	None
It is not enforceable against the company.	None
Thus, DTL creates a legal fiction with respect to the concepts of taxation and liability which is contrary to the legal meaning enunciated by several judgments of this Court (See State of Kerala v Madras Rubber Factory Ltd. AIR 1998 SC 723 at 730 and Shree Digvijay Cement Co. Ltd. v. Union of India (2003) 2 SCC 614 at 627, para 26 and 27).	None
On the question of effect of Section 211(3A), (3B) and (3C), learned counsel submitted that Section 211(3A) cannot be read to imply that Accounting Standards have to be complied with even if they are inconsistent with the Act or that they alter amend any provisions of the Companies Act.	None
As regards Section 211(3B), learned counsel submitted that any deviation from the Accounting Standards has to be qualified by the auditors which may lead to adverse consequences for the company.	None
According to learned counsel, unless the company is likely to make loss in near future, timing difference can never arise.	None
According to learned counsel, tax depreciation, in India, is higher than book depreciation and, therefore, DTL will exist in the financial statements indefinitely.	None
This is one more effect of AS 22 being implemented in India.	None
On the other hand, according to learned counsel, the very purpose of AS 22 of presenting true and fair view can be easily achieved by making AS 22 a disclosure requirement as Notes to the Accounts, rather than inserting it in Schedule VI, Parts I and II to the Companies Act.	None
Mr. S.K. Bagaria, learned counsel appearing on behalf of J.K. Tyre Industries Ltd. (formerly known as J.K. Industries Ltd.), submitted that AS 22 requires charging the PL a c for an assumed liability on account of deferred tax which is not payable according to the provisions of I.T. Act for the accounting period nor does it represent any tax which would become payable in future.	None
That, AS 22 requires provision to be made for alleged tax liabilities and recognition of alleged tax assets which are not at all accrued liabilities or assets.	None
According to learned counsel, AS 22 requires provision for assumed tax liabilities and recognition of assumed tax assets which are in reality nonexistent, commercially or under the law.	None
According to the learned counsel, notional and imaginary working is required to be made for AS 22 that, deferred tax is neither an asset nor a liability that, the accrual basis of accounting requires a provision to be made for a known liability existing on the balancesheet date and that any provision made on account of tax not payable under I.T. Act for the accounting period is not a provision for any known liability according to the accrual basis of accounting.	None
According to the learned counsel, any amount set aside on account of tax for which there is no liability under the I.T. Act cannot be considered as a tax expense for the period of account that, statutory levy of tax has to be measured and recognized as per the I.T. Act or the Companies Act or any other applicable enactment and that if the I.T. Act does not create DTL, such liability does not exist at all.	None
According to the learned counsel, under the accrual basis of accounting, a company is required to make provision only for a liability which has accrued in the relevant accounting year that, in respect of contingent liability, it is not required to make any provision but only a note is required to be given in the accounts known as Disclosure Note that, DTL is not even a contingent liability and that, on the balancesheet date several events such as the working of the company in future years, whether the company will earned a taxable profit (loss) in future are events which are totally unknown at the end of the accounting period when the company is required to recognize, measure and account for DTL.	None
According to the learned counsel, if there is no income in future, there would be no liability for tax in future and if there is income and additions to assets in future, the difference in depreciation under the Companies Act and under the I.T. Act for the accounting period will not result in any tax liability in future and there would be no reversal of the DTL created in the accounting period.	None
According to learned counsel, AS 22 requires recognition of the tax effect, whether current or deferred, in respect of individual transaction during the accounting period as if in future the company would have to make payment on account of deferred tax.	None
According to learned counsel, the aforestated concept is merely an assumption.	None
Under the I.T. Act, tax is determined with reference to the total income and not with reference to any individual transaction.	None
The total income in future is uncertain.	None
The total statutory tax liability in future is also uncertain.	None
The difference between the current accounting income and the current taxable income, for example, on account of depreciation, may or may not have any impact on the computation of the total income of a future year or it may or may not entail any tax liability.	None
Therefore, it cannot be said with certainty that deferred tax in respect of an individual transaction of the accounting period would result in any cash outflow on account of tax in a future year.	None
According to learned counsel, AS 22 has been framed on the fundamental accounting assumption of going concern.	None
However, it is one thing to assume that business would go on and quite another to assume that it will produce profits.	None
If there is no taxable income in future, the tax effect of the transactions of the accounting period will not translate into any actual liability or cash outflow.	None
According to learned counsel, AS 22 assumes that there would be sufficient taxable income in future entailing tax liability in future and that the tax effect of the transactions in the accounting period would have a role to play in the determination of future taxable income and liability.	None
According to learned counsel, the above is also an assumption.	None
According to learned counsel, the accrued liability for tax is the liability in respect of the amount of tax statutorily payable on the taxable income computed from the accounting income in accordance with the I.T. Act after making appropriate deduction allowances and disallowances.	None
Such liability for tax represents the provision for taxation.	None
Any amount in excess of such liability would be a reserve.	None
If the I.T. Act does not create any liability for tax, such liability does not exist in fact or in law and, therefore, it would be contrary to all norms of prudence to recognize or provide for a nonexistent liability.	None
According to learned counsel, liability for tax must exist under I.T. Act for it to be called an accrued liability that the contention of the Institute that liability for tax should be considered in the accounting sense and not in the strict legal sense proceeds on the basis that deferred tax is not an accrued liability in the legal sense that, the tax liability in the income is only to the extent the I.T. Act provides for such liability that real liability for income tax is only as computed under the I.T. Act that, merely because the difference between the accounting income and taxable income is ascertainable and merely because tax effect on account of such difference can be worked out on the basis of existing tax rates, it cannot be said that such tax effect represents a real liability payable today or tomorrow.	None
According to learned counsel, the difference between accounting and taxable income in a given year may or may not give rise to a liability or outflow of money in future.	None
According to learned counsel, this is an assumption.	None
This is totally uncertain.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, to give tax effect on such difference cannot be treated as an accrued liability and in respect of such difference, no income tax is payable under the I.T. Act for the accounting period.	None
Mr. Bagaria, learned counsel, further submitted that accrual is a legal concept.	None
It has not been defined under I.T. Act.	None
It has not defined under the Companies Act.	None
An accrued liability arises only if that liability has arisen in the accounting year concerned.	None
This position has been settled by various decisions of this Court.	None
It has been further held in numerous decisions by this Court that provision for taxation is the provision for tax liability under the I.T. Act as on the last date of the accounting year and that if anything is provided in excess of such tax liability, it will not be a provision but it will be a reserve (See the judgment of this Court in Metal Box Company of India Ltd. v. Their Workmen AIR 1969 SC 612 ).	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, if the I.T. Act does not create any liability for tax, there is no liability for tax either in fact or in law.	None
Learned counsel, however, invited our attention to the difference between contractual liability in case of cars sold with warranties and tax liabilities which, according to learned counsel, stand on a totally different footing as it is to be determined in accordance with the principles laid down in various judgments of this Court under the I.T. Act.	None
Learned counsel next contended that under Section 209(3)(b) of the Companies Act read with Section 209(1), income and expenditure and assets and liabilities should be accounted for in the books of account on accrual basis and according to the double entry system of accounting that, the concept of accrual in Section 209(3)(b) is required to be understood in the same manner as it is required to be understood judicially.	None
According to the learned counsel, accrual has been defined in AS 1, which has also been prescribed by the impugned Notification dated 7.12.06, as revenues and costs recognized as they are earned or incurred and recorded in the financial statements of the periods to which they relate.	None
According to learned counsel, the definition of the word accrual in Notification dated 25.1.96 issued by the Central Government under Section 145(2) of the I.T. Act also referred to the word accrual as an assumption, namely, that revenues and costs are recognized as they are earned or incurred and so recorded in the financial statements for the period(s) to which they relate.	None
According to learned counsel, the Accounting Standard notified under I.T. Act also requires the accounts to give a true and fair view.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the definition of the word accrual is the same both in the Accounting Standard prescribed under Section 211(3C) and that which is notified under Section 145(2) of the I.T. Act.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the word accrual for the purposes of the Companies Act does not carry any meaning different from that mentioned for the purposes of the I.T. Act.	None
That, only the amount of income tax actually payable under the I.T. Act with reference to the taxable income for the period covered by the account computed in accordance with the provisions of that Act can constitute a charge for income tax and is, therefore, an accrued liability.	None
Any amount in excess of such tax is a reserve and not a provision for taxation.	None
According to learned counsel, therefore, for the above reasons AS 22 insofar as it relates to deferred tax is contrary to the concept of accrual which concept is recognized under Section 209(3)(b) read with Section 209(1) of the Companies Act.	None
On the question of matching principle, learned counsel urged that the matching concept is fully complied with when a provision is a made for tax computed in accordance with the provisions of the I.T. Act with reference to the taxable income derived from the accounting income after making appropriate deductions, allowances and disallowances in accordance with the statutory provisions.	None
According to learned counsel, matching tax in respect of accounting income is only the tax computed for the accounting period, according to the provisions of the I.T. Act.	None
It is not any assumed future taxation dependent upon any assumed future working of the company.	None
The object of incurring expenses is to produce revenue.	None
In measuring the income for a period, revenue is to be adjusted against expenses incurred for producing that revenue.	None
This concept of adjusting offsetting the expenses against revenue is the matching principle.	None
This concept is fully satisfied when provision for taxation is made for tax liability in accordance with the provisions of the I.T. Act and it is such tax alone which is the tax liability incurred on the income earned during the period concerned.	None
As regards the question of the functional utility of Accounting Standards under Section 211(3A), (3B) and (3C) is concerned, learned counsel submitted that Section 209 provides that every company keeping proper books of account with respect to moneys received and expended and the matters in respect of which the receipt and expenditure takes place as well as the assets and liabilities of the company.	None
According to learned counsel, therefore, Section 209(1) recognizes the receipt and expenditure as well as assets and liabilities that, prior to substitution of Section 209(3) by the Companies Act (Amendment) Act, 1988 w.e.f. 15.6.88, did not provide for keeping the books of account on accrual basis.	None
However, based on the report of Sachar Committee to the effect that true and fair view should be projected, Section 209 was suitably amended to make it obligatory on all companies to maintain accounts on mercantile system of accounting.	None
Based on the recommendation of the Sachar Committee subsection (3) was substituted.	None
Thus, from Section 209, according to learned counsel, the following position becomes clear, namely, that Section 209 recognises receipt and expenditure as well as assets and liabilities on accrual basis and on double entry system for accounting.	None
After the said amendment, books of account are required to be kept on accrual basis.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the requirement of true and fair view stands incorporated in Section 209(3)(a), Section 211(1), (2) and (5) Section 217(2AA)(ii) and Section 227(2).	None
According to learned counsel, on bare reading of Section 227 read with Section 209 it is clear that the auditor of the company has to report that proper books of account as required by law has been kept by the company that, proper books of account shall not be deemed to be kept unless they are kept on accrual basis and double entry system of accounting that, the auditor has to report that the balancesheet and the PL a c are in agreement with the books of account and that the auditor has also to report whether profit and loss account as well as balancesheet complies with the Accounting Standards referred to in Section 211(3C).	None
According to learned counsel, subsection (3A) of Section 211 requires every PL a c and balancesheet of the company to comply with the Accounting Standards that, subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) do not refer to keeping of proper books of account that this subject is covered by Section 209 only which mandates that proper books of account shall not be deemed to be kept unless the same are kept on accrual basis and double entry system of accounting that, the said mandate of Section 209 cannot be altered by the Accounting Standards and since the Accounting Standards as per subsection (3A) can only relate to the PL a c and balancesheet and not to keeping proper books of account which are basic primary records from which the PL a c and balance sheet are prepared and since PL a c and balancesheet are not books of account but only abstracts.	None
AS 22 relating to deferred tax is directly in conflict with Section 209 of the Companies Act and in excess of the powers vested under subsection (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211.	None
In this connection, learned submitted that the power conferred upon the Central Government under subsection (3C) of Section 211 for prescribing Accounting Standards by framing of rules is in the nature of delegated legislation that under the scheme of subsection (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211, Accounting Standards can be prescribed only in relation to PL a c and balancesheet that a delegatee of power cannot assumed jurisdiction in areas or over subjects which are not delegated that the power being limited to prescribing Accounting Standards for PL a c and balancesheet, cannot be exercised in relation to maintenance of books of account and that too on a basis different from accrual basis mandated in Section 209 and any such exercise of power by prescribing any Accounting Standard affecting the maintenance of proper books of account and that too on a basis different from accrual basis will be in excess of the powers vested in the Central Government under subsection (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211 and will be directly in conflict with Section 209 of the Companies Act.	None
In this connection, learned counsel submitted that AS 22 requires a company to reduce or increase its net profit by passing journal entries in its books of account in respect of DTL or DTA that it is only after these entries are made in the books of account in respect of DTA or DTL that the net profit in the PL a c can be increased or reduced and DTA or DTL can be reflected in the balancesheet after the head Investments in case of DTA and after the head Unsecured Loans in case of DTL and, therefore, according to learned counsel, AS 22 exceeds the power conferred by subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C).	None
According to learned counsel, the power under subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) only relates to prescribing Accounting Standards for presentation of PL a c and balancesheet	None
whereas AS 22 directly and immediately encroaches upon preparation of books of account and maintenance and proper books of account on accrual basis and in the process violates the mandate statutorily imposed by Section 209(3).	None
That, there is no power conferred by subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) nor by any other subsections of 211 to prescribe Accounting Standards relating to maintenance of proper books of account.	None
In this connection, learned counsel pointed out that the duty of the auditor is to report in terms of Section 227(3)(d) about compliance with the Accounting Standards referred to in subsection (3C) of Section 211 which applies only in respect of PL a c and balancesheet that, the said provision makes it clear that compliance with the Accounting Standards is to be made only in respect of the PL a c and balancesheet	None
whereas keeping of books of account in terms of Section 209 is required to be reported upon by the auditor only in terms of Section 227(3)(d) and, therefore, AS 22 exceeds the power conferred by subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211.	None
Learned counsel submitted that AS 22 is confined to prescribing Accounting Standards for presentation of PL a c and balancesheet.	None
It does not deal with preparation of books of account.	None
That subject falls under Section 209(3).	None
Therefore, AS 22 prescribes Accounting Standards only for PL a c and balancesheet without directing that exercise to be made in respect of preparation and maintenance and proper books of account on accrual basis and, therefore, AS 22 brings about inconsistency between the provisions of Section 209(3) on one hand and subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211.	None
According to learned counsel, Section 217(2AA)(i) merely relates to preparation of annual accounts it does not deal at all with preparation and maintenance of books of account that annual accounts are not books of account (See Section 210) and, therefore, the said Section 217(2AA)(i) has nothing to do with preparation and maintenance of proper books of account which subject is independently dealt with in Section 209.	None
According to learned counsel, the provisions of AS 22 insofar as it requires making of entries in the books of account reducing the profit by accounting for DTL or increasing the profit by accounting for DTA and to reflect such entries in the PL a c and balancesheet, are ultra vires subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211 and Section 209 of the Companies Act.	None
That, by AS 22, insofar as the same relates to deferred tax, the delegatee of power (Central Government) has attempted to encroach upon the areas far beyond those covered by the delegation.	None
45	None
According to the learned counsel, Section 211(1) starts with the mandate that every balancesheet of a company shall give a true and fair view at the end of the financial year.	None
This mandate is, according to learned counsel, not subject to anything.	None
It is not qualified by the expression subject to the provisions of this section.	None
Similar is the position in subsection (2) of Section 211 with regard to the PL a c. Therefore, according to learned counsel, true and fair view requirement is the primary requirement of Section 211(1) and Section 211(2) which requirement stands satisfied only if the accrual basis is followed as mandated in Section 209(3).	None
According to learned counsel, the expression subject to the provisions of this section in Section 211(1) obviously includes the provision of subsection (1).	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, even in terms of the specific language of Section 211(1) the requirement of true and fair view in that subsection is a standalone concept and it is not subject to anything.	None
According to learned counsel, accrual basis in Section 209(3) is a necessary component of true and fair view as a requirement and, therefore, the said requirement in Section 211 and in Section 209 would have the same meaning.	None
However, according to learned counsel, the expression subject to the provisions of this section in Section 211(1) only qualifies the requirement of balancesheet being in the form set out in Part I of Schedule VI that, similarly the expression subject as aforesaid in subsection (2) of Section 211 only qualifies the requirement of Part II of Schedule VI in respect of PL a c that, subsection (3A) of Section 211 inter alia provides that every PL a c and balancesheet of the company shall comply with the Accounting Standards and, therefore, according to learned counsel in the entire scheme relating to accounts and audit in Part VI, Chapter I, Section 209 to Section 233B of the Companies Act, the statutory mandate of keeping proper books of account on accrual basis is not allowed to be altered or encroached upon by any Accounting Standards.	None
According to learned counsel, it is the statutory mandate that PL a c and balancesheet shall be in consonance with the books of account.	None
Therefore, subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) can only relate to presentation of and disclosures in PL a c and balancesheet, keeping intact the statutory mandate of maintaining proper books of account on accrual basis.	None
Therefore, if the format of a balancesheet or the requirements of PL a c is allowed to be altered by any Accounting Standards it would amount to encroachment upon the statutory mandate of keeping proper books of account on accrual basis.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, Accounting Standards can provide in relation to presentation of and disclosures in PL a c and balancesheet without touching upon the basic requirement of maintaining proper books of account on accrual basis and only thereby one can comply with the concept of true and fair view.	None
Any other interpretation would mean that AS 22 far exceeds the power conferred by subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211 and it would amount to creating inconsistencies between various sections of the Companies Act.	None
Learned counsel next contended that accrual basis of accounting does not recognize DTA or DTL that, accounting for any DTA or DTL would be contrary to the accrual basis of accounting and would not result in keeping of proper books of account in terms of Section 209.	None
Neither the books of account nor the PL a c or balancesheet which are required to be in agreement with the books of account will give a true and fair view if accounting has to be made in respect of DTA or DTL that, AS 22 does not result in a true and fair measurement of the PL a c or the state of affairs of a company and if any provision is made on account of deferred tax with reference to the difference between accounting and taxable incomes for which no liability exists under the I.T. Act, such provision would distort the books of account and financial statements and would not give a true and fair view.	None
That, similarly creation of a deferred tax asset because of current losses would distort the books of account and financial statements and would not give a true and fair view.	None
According to learned counsel, accrual basis is a necessary component of true and fair view requirement.	None
The provision contrary to the accrual basis cannot satisfy the said requirement.	None
Lastly, according to learned counsel, the only way out of the above inconsistencies is to harmoniously construe Sections 209, 211 and AS 22 by reading down the said Standard so that the company is only required to make a disclosure in the PL a c and balancesheet as regards DTA or DTL without requiring the company to make any entry in the books of account or without making any company to reduce or increase its net profit.	None
Lastly, learned counsel submitted that vide para 33 of AS 22 DTL is sought to be created in respect of individual transactions since the inception of the company which may be long before the AS 22 came into effect resulting in reduction of the revenue reserve by the amount of such DTL.	None
That, the working required to be made in terms of para 33 of AS 22 is complicated.	None
In this connection, learned counsel pointed out that under para 34 of AS 22, not only opening balances of assets but also opening balances of liabilities for accounting purposes and for tax purposes have got to be compared that, para 33 requires a working to be made in respect of individual transactions since the inception of the company in order to ascertain DTAs or DTLs.	None
That, in case of DTL, the revenue reserve has to be reduced and conversely in case of a DTA, the revenue reserve has to be increased.	None
This is, according to learned counsel, indicates that para 33 which is termed as transitional provision is clearly retrospective in its operation.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, para 33 of AS 22 would result in reduction of the companys revenue reserves.	None
It will erode the companys net worth.	None
It will alter the companys debtequity ratio.	None
It will adversely effect the companys borrowing capacity.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the High Court had erred in dismissing the writ petitions filed by the appellants.	None
According to learned counsel, Section 211(3C) does not enable the Central Government to give any retrospective operation to the Accounting Standards.	None
The rulemaking power under Section 642 of the Companies Act also does not permit the making of any rules with retrospective effect and, therefore, according to learned counsel, para 33 deserves to be set aside.	None
For the above reasons, learned counsel submitted that AS 22 far exceeds the power and jurisdiction conferred by subsections (3A), (3B) and (3C) of Section 211 and that it brings about inconsistencies between various sections of the Companies Act and, therefore, the said AS 22 deserves to be struck down or in the alternative AS 22 deserves to be read down so that at best the company is required to make a disclosure in the PL a c and balancesheet as regards any DTA or DTL without requiring it to make any entry in the books of account and without requiring any company to increase or reduce its net profit (loss).	None
Mr. A Sharan, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for Union of India, submitted that validity of a legislation could be challenged on grounds of incompetence of the legislation or same being violative of Part III of the Constitution.	None
That, a subordinate legislation can be challenged additionally on the grounds that the same is beyond the authority of delegate or that it is violative of provisions of the enactment.	None
According to learned counsel, in the present case, appellants have not challenged the competence of the Central Government to notify or provide for Accounting Standards, they have restricted their challenge only on the ground that AS 22 contravenes the provisions of Companies Act by stating that the same violates Sections 205, 209, 211 and Schedule VI of the Companies Act.	None
According to learned counsel, even in that regard no details have been given by the appellants in their original writ petition as to how the impugned Accounting Standard contravenes the provisions of the Companies Act.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the entire original writ petition filed by the appellant is misplaced, misconceived and not maintainable for want of details.	None
Learned counsel urged that AS22 provides for a different manner than Schedule VI in which account of a company required to be prepared.	None
It is submitted that Schedule VI is the form set out under the Companies Act in which a company is required to submit its balancesheet and profit and loss account.	None
Section 211(1) requires the companies to prepare their balancesheet in the form set out in PartI of Schedule VI.	None
A plain reading of Section 211 reveals that the requirement of submission of balancesheet in the said form is subject to the other subsections of Section 211 and hence the format of the said balance shall necessarily be guided by the Accounting Standards provided under subsection (3A) as same is having overriding effect on Part I of Schedule VI.	None
According to learned counsel, when any provision made is subject to other provisions of that section, then the said provision (Part I of Schedule VI) has to give way the other provisions (AS22 as provided by Section 221(3A)).	None
In this connection, reliance is placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of South India Corporation (P) Ltd. v. Board of Revenue, Trivandrum and Anr.	None
AIR 1964 SC 207 at p.215, in which this Court has held that the expression subject to conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provision(s) to which it is subject to.	None
Reliance was also placed by the learned counsel on the judgment of this Court in the cases The State of Bihar and Anr.	None
v. Sir Kameshwan Singh and Anr.	None
AIR 1952 SC 252 R.C.S. Balakrishna Chetty and Sons Co. v. The State of Madras AIR 1961 SC 1152 and Heggade Janardhan Subbaraya v. The State of Mysore and Ors.	None
AIR 1963 SC 702 .	None
In the alternative, learned counsel submitted that in any event Section 641 empowers the Central Government to amend Schedule VI	None
whereas Section 642 confers powers on the Central Government to formulate rules.	None
That, Part I of Schedule VI prescribes the form in which the balancesheet and PL a c is required to be prepared.	None
According to learned counsel, AS 22 is prescribed by the Central Government with respect to computation of tax liability that, AS 22 lays down the manner in which the said computation of tax liability in the balancesheet is required to be prepared and, therefore, in pith and substance AS 22, according to learned counsel, prescribes additional mode in which tax liability of a company is required to be calculated.	None
Thus, according to learned counsel, exercise of power by the Central Government under Section 642 providing for AS 22 is exercise of power for same purpose which is required to be exercised under Section 641 to amend Schedule VI and, therefore, in pith and substance, according to learned counsel, exercise of power by the Central Government under Section 642 will be deemed to be exercise of power by the Central Government under Section 641 and accordingly Part I of Schedule VI will stand modified amended to the extent it contravenes AS 22.	None
This is particularly because Part I of Schedule VI is subject to Section 211(3A) of the Companies Act.	None
According to learned counsel, under Section 211 every company is required to prepare its balancesheet and PL a c in the manner provided therein.	None
Subsection (3A) of that Section makes it mandatory to comply with Accounting Standards.	None
While preparing PL a c and balancesheet (See Section 211(3C)).	None
According to learned counsel, since AS 22 is an Accounting Standard prescribed under subsection (3C) it has a statutory status, required to be followed while preparing the books of account in terms of Section 211 of the Companies Act.	None
Lastly, learned counsel urged that the Companies Act is a special statute that, Section 211 is a special provision aimed at providing the form and content of PL a c and balancesheet required to be prepared by the company that, a special provision like Section 211 ordinarily overrides the general provision that, if a special provision is made on a particular subject then that subject is excluded from the general provision and since AS 22 is a special provision notified under Section 211(3C) with respect to form and content of accounts of the company, the same will override other provisions of the Companies Act as well as any other statute to the extent provided therein.	None
In this connection, learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the cases Gadde Venkateswara Rao v. Government of Andhra Pradesh and Ors.	None
AIR 1966 SC 828 State of Bihar v. Dr. Yogendra Singh GOL (Retired) and Ors.	None
(1982) 1 SCC 664 Maharashtra State Board of Sec. and High.	None
Sec.	None
Education and Anr. etc. v. Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth and Ors. etc. (1984) 4 SCC 27 State of Gujarat and Anr. etc. v. Patel Ramjibhai Danabhai and Ors. etc. (1979) 3 SCC 347	None
In view of the aforestated submissions learned counsel submitted that AS 22 is intra vires the Companies Act and, therefore, the appeals deserve to be dismissed with costs.	None
Mr. N.K. Poddar, learned senior counsel appearing for the Institute, submitted that corporate accounts are required to disclose a true and fair view.	None
It is a requirement.	None
That requirement has to be ensured by the auditors who have to certify that the accounts are prepared so as to provide true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company.	None
This responsibility is undertaken by accountants and auditors who are members of the Institute.	None
If Accounting Standards are not followed, financial accounts would not be true and fair and in that case, the statutory requirement in Section 211 for preparing true and fair accounts would not be satisfied.	None
According to learned counsel, prior to 1988 the requirement contemplated by the Companies Act was disclosure of true and correct view.	None
This requirement was deliberately changed by the Legislature to true and fair view.	None
When it was a question of disclosing a true and correct view, it was permissible to look into the legal liability for tax, and make a provision accordingly but when the requirement in law is to disclose true and fair accounts, a wider perspective is warranted.	None
That is why, the Institute states that the I.T. provision should be based not only on the strict legal liability to be discharged immediately, but also on the legal liability based on book profits (real profits) which are earned and reflected in the corporate accounts of the company.	None
Therefore, the Institute insists that there should be a reasonable matching of cost and benefit, if the accounts are to disclose a true and fair view.	None
The Institute has legal obligation of ensuring disclosure of true and fair view in the corporate accounts.	None
However, in the absence of a statutory definition of true and fair, it is the Institutes function to determine the basic rules for ensuring disclosure of a true and fair view.	None
According to learned counsel, true and fair view is a concept which requires the Auditor to look at the substance rather than pure legal form and that is why all its Accounting Standards emphasize the importance of Substance over Form.	None
The said view of the Institute is duly affirmed by Parliament when Parliament decreed that corporate accounts shall comply with the proper Accounting Standards (See subsections (3A) and (3B) of Section 211 of the Companies Act).	None
The basic reason for issuing AS 1 through Notification dated 25.1.96 of Government of India, to be followed by all assessees following mercantile system of accounting, was to lay down that accounting policies adopted by an assessee should represent a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the business in the financial statements prepared and presented based on such accounting policies.	None
Therefore, the requirement true and fair view overrides all other statutory requirements as to the matters to be included in the corporate accounts.	None
In order to give a true and fair view it is not necessary to provide information, additional to the one needed to comply with all other statutory requirements or even to depart from compliance with one or the other requirements.	None
Any departure has to be disclosed in a Note to the Financial Statements giving reasons for such departure and its effects.	None
Moreover, the concept of true and fair is not static.	None
It is dynamic in nature.	None
It continues to evolve in accordance with the changes in the requirements of economy.	None
It is the function of the Institute to regulate the profession of Chartered Accountants.	None
By formulating Accounting Standards, Institute is fulfilling its statutory function.	None
It is furthering Legislative intent of Parliament, which requires that accounts should be true and fair.	None
Therefore, by laying down Accounting Standards, which explains what is true and fair, the Institute is merely fulfilling its statutory duty and function.	None
Learned counsel submitted that conceptually, the justification for Accounting Standards lies in the compelling logic and conceptual validity of each Standard.	None
Those who prepare Accounting Standards are not framing the Standards without any basis.	None
The framers review accounting policies already adopted and select those policies which are most appropriate in the presentation of accounts based on the requirement of true and fair view.	None
The Standard represents the most appropriate accounting policies out of various accounting policies adopted by different companies over last several years.	None
This is what is called as conceptual validity.	None
The acceptance in such cases is not only recognized by statutory provisions but it is recognized by a wider degree of acceptance in the corporate world.	None
That is why, almost all the major public companies, in India, have recognized and accepted the validity of the Standards.	None
Even, this Court has expressed confirmation of commercial accounting Principles, Practices Standards recommended by the Institute (See Challapalli Sugars Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1975) 98 ITR 167 at 172 Commissioner of Central Excise v. Dai Ichi Karkaria Ltd. Ors.	None
(1999) 7 SCC 448 at 461.	None
On the topic of accrual learned counsel submitted that under Section 209(3)(b) all books of account are required to be kept on accrual basis and according to the double entry system of accounting.	None
According to learned counsel, the expressions accrual, accrual basis of accounting, accrued asset, accrued expense, accrued liability, accrued revenue, current assets, current liabilities, deferred expenditure, depreciation, provision, prudence etc. are explained and defined in the Guidance Note on Terms Used in Financial Statements issued by the Institute.	None
Learned counsel submitted that the matching principle is the most important concept in accrual accounting.	None
The matching principle indicates as to when expenses should be recorded against the revenue.	None
The Institute had issued Guidance Note on Accrual Basis of Accounting in 1988, since after the amendment of Section 209, requiring all companies to maintain their accounts on accrual basis of accounting.	None
All relevant above mentioned expressions relating to accrual basis of accounting including recognition of revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities have been explained in the said Guidance Note on Accrual Basis of Accounting which inter alia lays down the matching principle of recognizing costs against revenue or against the relevant time period to determine the periodic income.	None
According to learned counsel, in order to understand the relevance of Accounting Standards issued by the Institute for preparation and presentation of financial statements visavis the accrual system of accounting and visavis the matching principle it is necessary to refer to the concepts that underline the preparation and presentation of such statements.	None
The main purpose of Accounting Standards is, therefore, to assist the Accountants to prepare financial statements and to deal with topics that have yet to form the subject of an Accounting Standard.	None
The entire object is to promote harmonization of Regulations, Accounting Standards and Procedures relating to the preparation of financial statements by providing a basis for reducing a number of alternative accounting treatments permitted by Accounting Standards.	None
According to learned counsel, accrual basis, going concern and consistency are underlying assumptions in preparation of financial statements.	None
Prudence is important in the preparation of financial statements.	None
It is a degree of caution in the exercise of judgments needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty so that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated.	None
That, the principles to be followed in the recognition of assets, liabilities, income and expenses require application of the matching concept i.e. matching of costs with revenue, which principle involves combined recognition simultaneous recognition of revenues and expenses that result directly from the same transactions or other events.	None
According to learned counsel, this Court has always recognized the need for estimation in accrual system of accounting.	None
This Court, according to learned counsel, has recognized the accounting concept of matching costs with revenue in preparation of financial statements.	None
In this connection, learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Calcutta Company Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1959) 37 ITR 1 Madras Industrial Investment Corporation Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax  (1997) 225 ITR 802.	None
According to learned counsel, at one point of time in the past strict legal concept of accrual was laid down in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v. Tungabhadra Industries Ltd. (1994) 207	None
ITR 553 (Cal.) .	None
However, according to learned counsel, that strict legal concept is no longer accepted by the Courts and for that purpose learned counsel places reliance on the judgment of this Court on the same issue in the case of Madras Industrial Investment Corporation Ltd. (supra).	None
In short, learned counsel submitted that with globalization and with new concepts coming in, the law is no more confined to the strict legal concept of accrual which does not recognize the matching principle.	None
Learned counsel urged that the requirement for accrual basis of accounting was introduced in the Companies Act in 1988 through Section 209.	None
Under Section 209(1)	None
every company is required to maintain proper books of account with respect to receipts and expenses, sales and purchases of goods, assets and liabilities of the company, utilization of material or labour and such other items of costs incurred in production, process, manufacturing etc.	None
Under Section 209(3) proper books of account shall not be deemed to be kept if such books of account do not give true and fair accounts and if such books fail to explain its transactions further if such books are not kept on accrual basis they have to be rejected for not giving a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company.	None
This position is also reflected in Section 211.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, under the scheme of Companies Act, two requirements have to be satisfied, namely, accrual system of accounting and true and fair view.	None
Both must read together with each other.	None
According to learned counsel, the accrual basis of accounting must be applied so that true and fair accounts are presented.	None
Indeed, the requirement to present a true and fair view precedes the requirement for accrual accounting.	None
The requirement to present true and fair accounts is wider than the requirement of accrual accounting.	None
Therefore, in a given case it is possible that accounts prepared on accrual basis may not present true and fair view because of certain deficiencies, however, it is not possible for accounts to be true and fair unless they are prepared on accrual basis.	None
According to learned counsel, while Section 209(3)(b) mandates the accrual basis of accounting, it does not indicate the amount which should be recognized (accrued) in respect of specific matters.	None
This is left to the judgment of the Accountant.	None
According to learned counsel, accrual basis is a fundamental accounting assumption which means that all Accounting Standards including AS 22 are framed on the basis of accrual system of accounting and, therefore, the question of conflict of an Accounting Standard with the accrual basis of accounting does not arise.	None
That, all Accounting Standards are framed in order to present a true and fair view that, the primary consideration in the selection of accounting policies is to disclose a true and fair view and, therefore, the purpose of all Accounting Standards including AS 22 is to adopt the accrual basis of accounting in the context of disclosing a true and fair view and if this principle is kept in mind then there would be no conflict between AS 22 with accrual basis of accounting.	None
In fact, according to learned counsel, it is significant to note that while auditors are required to certify that accounts are true and fair, they are not required to certify that they are prepared on the accrual basis for the simple reason that accounts cannot be true and fair unless the accrual basis is adopted.	None
For example, a particular liability is not provided for, because it is not legally imminent, it could still be argued that accrual basis bas been adopted in a legalistic sense, but the accounts would nevertheless not represent true and fair view.	None
According to learned counsel, for the aforestated reasons Accounting Standards require that the accrual basis should be adopted in the context of presenting disclosing a true and fair view.	None
Therefore, the need to disclose a true and fair view is wider then the need for accrual accounts since it automatically includes accrual method of accounting.	None
Learned counsel urged that there is overriding importance for the disclosure of a true and fair view, since the entire structure of corporate credibility is built on this foundation.	None
Therefore, if any rules for technical disclosure are not consistent with the true and fair view requirement, then the company has to depart from the technical provisions, to the extent necessary, to give a true and fair view.	None
That, the disclosure requirements are subservient to the overriding requirement of presenting a true and fair view.	None
Therefore, in other words, the need to present a true and fair view should override technical compliance of the law on the basis of true and correct accrual.	None
Therefore, according to the learned counsel, AS 22 goes far beyond technical compliance in order to ensure a true and fair presentation.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, since Section 211(1) requires true and fair presentation, AS 22, is not beyond the mandate of the Companies Act.	None
Coming to the concept of prudence, learned counsel submitted that when financial statements are prepared, sometimes, the accountant comes across uncertainties that surround many events and in such case caution in exercise of the judgments is required while making estimates, so that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated.	None
This is the principle of prudence.	None
The said principle applies in view of uncertainties attached to future events.	None
Profits are not anticipated, but they are recognized only when they are realized.	None
Similarly, Provision is made for all known liabilities and losses, even though the amount cannot be determined with certainty and, therefore, Provision represents only an estimate in the light of available information.	None
The principle of prudence has also been recognized in the Accounting Standard issued by the Central Government under Section 145(2) of the I.T. Act through its notification dated 25.2.96 which is required to be followed by all assessees following mercantile system of accounting.	None
In this connection, reliance was placed by learned counsel on the judgment of this Court in the case of Chainrup Sampatram v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1953) 24 ITR 481 at 485 in which this Court has also underlined the effect that even for income tax purposes profits are to be computed in conformity with ordinary principles of commercial accounting unless such principles stand modified by specific legislative enactments provisions contained in the Income Tax Law.	None
Similarly, in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v. Duncan Brothers Co. Ltd. (1996) 8 SCC 31 at 35, this Court has observed that the terms used in the Companies Act should be read in the manner as understood in accounting parlance.	None
On the question of alleged conflict between AS 22 and Schedule VI of Companies Act, learned counsel submitted that Accounting Standards, issued by the Institute, deal with recognition, measurement and disclosure and certain elements in financial accounts of every enterprise.	None
That, Schedule VI deals with manner of presentation of financial data in the annual financial statements, namely, the balancesheet and PL a c to be drawn by a corporate enterprise at the end of each financial year.	None
That, Part I of Schedule VI lays down the form of balancesheet whereas Part II lays down the requirements as to the presentation of various financial data in the PL a c. Part II deals with interpretation of some of the expressions, namely, provisions, reserve, capital reserve, liability, investment etc.	None
According to learned counsel, except in the case of Depreciation which is provided by every corporate enterprise in accordance with the rates laid down in Schedule XIV of the Companies Act, having regard to the provisions contained in Sections 205, 350 of the said Act, the said Act does not lay down the procedure for recognition and measurement of either the income or expenses and or the assets and liabilities.	None
For example, Schedule VI nowhere lays down as to which assets should be recognized as Investments and also the method of valuing Investments.	None
Similarly, AS 6 deals with Depreciation Accounting, however, except the statutorily fixed rate of depreciation as laid down in Schedule XIV of the Companies Act, all other aspects relating to recognition and measurement of depreciation are dealt with only in AS 6.	None
They are not dealt with in the Companies Act.	None
Similarly, under Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act the manner of presentation of various items of income and expenses in the PL a c has been laid down.	None
However, the said Act nowhere lays down as to how and when income or expenditure should be measured and or recognized.	None
This aspect is dealt with by AS 9 alone and not by the provisions of the Companies Act.	None
According to learned counsel, events and contingencies occurring after the balancesheet date mentioned in AS 4, net profit or loss for a given period, prior period items and changes in accounting policies mentioned in AS 5, Accounting for Construction Contracts in AS 7, Accounting for Fixed Assets in AS 10, the Effect of changes in Foreign Exchange Rates as mentioned in AS 11, Accounting for Intangible Assets contained in AS 26, Accounting for Impairment of Assets in AS 28 are various aspects dealt with only under Accounting Standards and not under the Companies Act.	None
According to learned counsel, since the Companies Act nowhere deals with recognition and measurement of various items of income and expenses, assets and liabilities, and since it deals with only presentation, there can never be any conflict between the provisions of the said Act and the Accounting Standards issued by the Institute in discharge of its statutory obligations under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 read with the Companies Act, 1956 which requires that every corporate enterprise must maintain such books as are necessary to give a true and fair view of its state of affairs and to explain its transactions (See Section 209(3)), and that every balancesheet of a company shall give a true and fair view of the State of affairs of the company at the end of the financial year, and that every PL a c of a company shall also give true and fair view of the PL a c of a company for the financial year (See Section 211(1)(ii)).	None
It is in this context of true and fair view requirement that the Institute has framed Accounting Standards so as to enable proper recognition and measurement of all income and expenses, assets and liabilities etc.	None
as laid down in Section 209(1) read with Section 211(3A), (3B) and (3C).	None
Coming to the question of true scope and AS 22, learned counsel submitted that AS 22 deals with accounting for taxes on income.	None
According to learned counsel, as far back as in 1991, the Institute had issued the Guidance Note on Accounting for Taxes on Income.	None
This Note recommended deferred tax adjustments.	None
It also explained the taxes payable method.	None
It also explained the tax effect accounting method.	None
It also explained the method for calculating deferred tax adjustments under deferred method and under liability method.	None
It recommended that till the tax effect accounting method stood developed, it would be permissible for an enterprise to follow the taxes payable method as an alternative.	None
After 10 years, AS 22 was finally issued by the Institute in 2001 in order to ensure a true and fair view of the profits earned during a financial year, and the taxes payable with reference thereto, to be presented in the corporate accounts.	None
That is the reason why, AS 22 leaves out of account differences between book profits and taxable profits which are of permanent nature.	None
But AS 22 requires that DTL DTA arising on account of timing differences should be reflected in the corporate accounts through what is called as deferred tax account.	None
According to learned counsel, deferred tax accounting ensures that profits are measured in a real and factual manner.	None
It also ensures that the benefit obtained in one year, which could be reversed in a subsequent year, is duly recognized as a liability.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, AS 22 not only complies with the requirement for accrual accounting, but it applies the need for accrual accounting, in the context of presenting a true and fair view, rather than purely on the basis of a true and correct view.	None
Accounting treatments contained in various Accounting Standards issued by the Institute are based on accrual accounting and, therefore, these Standards adopt the accounting treatments mentioned therein to ensure that a company has followed the accrual basis of accounting.	None
According to learned counsel, AS 22, therefore, fulfills, the need for accrual accounting in the context of the true and fair view requirement.	None
According to learned counsel, there is a difference between accrual accounting on the basis of true and correct view visavis accrual accounting on the basis of true and fair view.	None
In the case of former, the profits are likely to be overstated and in which event the investors would be misled.	None
That, the purpose of true and fair accounts is to protect investors and, therefore, the purpose of AS 22 is to ensure that accrual is made on a true and fair basis, by reference to the Substance rather than the Form.	None
Learned counsel urged that the very object behind issuance of AS 22 is that in accordance with the matching concept, taxes on income are recognized (accrued) in the same period as the revenue and expenses to which they relate.	None
Matching of such taxes against income revenue for a period raises problems as taxable income may be different from accounting income significantly.	None
According to learned counsel, para 4 of AS 22 lays down the definitions of various terms used in AS 22.	None
One such term is current tax which has been defined to mean the amount of income tax determined as payable in respect of taxable income (loss) for a particular period.	None
Similarly, in para 4 the expression deferred tax has been defined to mean what is called as timing differences which in turn has been defined to mean the differences between taxable income and accounting income for a period.	None
Such timing differences originates in one period and are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.	None
Timing differences arises because the period in which some items of revenue and expenses are included in taxable income which items do not coincide with the period in which such items are included or considered in arriving at accounting income.	None
This difference between taxable income and accounting income arises for two reasons.	None
Firstly, there are differences between items of revenue and expenses, as appearing in the PL a c, and the items which are considered as revenue, expenses or deductions for tax purposes.	None
Secondly, there are differences between the amount in respect of a particular item of revenue or expense, as recognized in the PL a c, and the corresponding amount, which is recognized for the computation of taxable income.	None
This happens in the case of depreciation.	None
The tax laws allow incentive depreciation on increased rate, as prescribed in Rule 5 read with the percentages mentioned in second column of the table in appendix I to the I.T. Rules, 1962 on the written down value of the block of assets, as are used by the assessee for the purpose of the business at any time during the relevant previous year.	None
Depreciation includes amortization of assets whose useful life is predetermined.	None
The commercial accounting principle requires that the original cost of an asset should written off in the accounts by way of charge against income of each year in such a manner that its entire cost is debited against the income arising therefrom during life time of such asset.	None
However, the I.T. Act lays down incentive rates of depreciation.	None
While for accounting purposes, depreciation is provided for on straight line method, the Income Tax Act allows depreciation by way of incentive at much higher rate with reference to its written down value.	None
The total depreciation charged on the plant and machinery for accounting purposes and the amount allowed as deduction for tax purposes ultimately remains constant, but period over which depreciation is charged in the accounts as compared to the period during which the deduction is allowed under I.T. Act, will differ.	None
This is a case of timing difference.	None
For example, machinery purchased for scientific research is fully allowed as deduction in the very first year for tax purposes, whereas the same would charged in the PL a c, as depreciation, over its useful life of, let us say, 15 years.	None
Unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses, which can be set off against future taxable income, are also examples of timing differences.	None
Such timing differences result in DTAs.	None
According to learned counsel, for the above reasons para 9 of AS 22 lays down that tax expense for a given period, shall, therefore, consists of current taxation and deferred tax which included in the determination of the net profit or loss for the period.	None
Similarly, para 10 of AS 22 further provides that tax effects of timing differences should be included in the tax expense in the PL a c and as deferred tax assets or as deferred tax liabilities in the balancesheet.	None
Learned counsel for the Institute next submitted that para 33 of AS 22 is Transitional Provisions.	None
According to the learned counsel, it is not retrospective as alleged by the appellants.	None
According to learned counsel, under Section 209(3)(b) of the Companies Act, books of account must be kept on accrual basis and according to the double entry system of accounting.	None
In other words, if a company was maintaining its accounts on cash basis prior to 1988 when the present section came into existence, the said company is required to change the system of accounting from cash to mercantile w.e.f. 15.6.88.	None
However, this would not mean that without maintaining accounts on mercantile basis, the company would not record the opening balances of its assets and liabilities merely because Section 209(3)(b) does not refer to retrospective application.	None
Learned counsel submitted that, therefore, there is no merit in the submissions made on behalf of the appellants that para 33 of AS 22 is ultra vires the provisions of the Companies Act.	None
For the above reasons, learned counsel submitted that AS 22 is in no way contradictory to and or in conflict of Schedule VI to the Companies Act having regard to the statutory requirement consideration of presenting the financial statements in true and fair manner as laid down in Section 211(1)(ii) of the Companies Act.	None
That, clause (vi) under para 3 of Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act reference is made only to presentation of income liability in the PL a c. It does not refer to the method of its recognition and or measurement which aspects are considered and dealt with only by AS 22.	None
Therefore, the portion of income tax expenses deferred to future tax returns is required to be credited to a Liability Account called as Deferred Income Tax Account.	None
On behalf of the appellants it was vehemently submitted that the DTL is a notional and contingent liability and, therefore, it is not required to be charged to the PL a c as per the requirements of the Companies Act.	None
According to the appellants DTL is a future liability and, therefore, it does not exist on the balancesheet.	None
Appellants have also argued that DTL is a contingent liability because it may or may not arise in future.	None
They have argued that DTL is not in accordance with the requirement of Section 209(3)(b) of the Companies Act as it does not amount to keeping books of account on accrual basis.	None
In reply, Mr. Poddar, submitted that DTL is not a notional tax liability, but a real liability as it results in future cash outflow in the form of tax payment to the Income Tax Department.	None
According to learned counsel, DTL arises in the current year in which the timing difference originates i.e. during the year the difference in the tax depreciation and accounting depreciation arises.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, DTL exists on the balancesheet date for the financial year in which it originates and, therefore, it is a real liability.	None
According to learned counsel, the liability which arises in the current year (i.e. the year in which timing difference arises) and is payable in a future year is not a future liability.	None
According to learned counsel, DTL arises, therefore, in the current financial year in which timing difference arises but is payable in a future financial year.	None
According to learned counsel, the aforestated concept is the essence of the accrual basis of accounting which has been defined in AS 1.	None
Learned counsel further submitted that for the above reasons DTL is not a contingent liability as it actually arises in the financial year in which the timing difference originates.	None
According to learned counsel, a contingent liability becomes a liability on happening or not happening of an uncertain event in future.	None
That DTL is not contingent.	None
It does not arise in future on happening or not happening of future event.	None
That, there is a difference in the liability arising in future or contingent on a future event taking place and a liability, which exists today, but payment in respect of which is to be made in future.	None
That, any existing liability payable in future is not a future or contingent liability.	None
According to learned counsel, DTL is an existing liability on the balancesheet date.	None
According to learned counsel, reversal of timing difference in respect of an asset is definite during the life of an asset.	None
Therefore, there is no uncertainty with regard to the reversal of timing difference in future over the life of the asset.	None
The accounts of a company are prepared under the fundamental accounting assumption of going concern which is defined in AS 1 under which the enterprise is normally looked upon as a going concern, i.e., continuing in operation for the foreseeable future.	None
Under that assumption it is assumed that the enterprise has neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation or to reduce the scale of its operations.	None
Therefore, according to learned counsel, the examples, given on behalf of the appellants, of liquidation or fall in the scale of operations are not apposite illustrations for treating DTL as a notional liability.	None
According to learned counsel, DTL is a liability for the current period i.e. for the period in which the timing difference originates, on the basis of matching principle also, which is a part of accrual basis of accounting.	None
In the light of the said submissions, learned counsel contended that the charge in the PL a c for deferred tax expense is in respect of a known liability payable in future and, therefore, it is covered by the definition of the word Provision as contained in Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	None
On the question of ultra vires learned counsel for the Institute had adopted the contentions advanced by learned Additional Solicitor General on behalf of Union of India.	None
Finding For the following reasons we hold that the impugned Rule which adopts AS 22 neither suffers from the vice of excessive delegation nor is the said Rule incongruous inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956.	None
Reasons Preface India is an emerging economy.	None
Globalization has helped India to achieve the GDP rate of around 8 to 9 per cent.	None
However, with globalization, India is required to face challenges in various forms.	None
Corporate India has been acquiring companies in India and abroad.	None
Indian companies are partners in joint ventures.	None
They are part of international consortium.	None
Therefore, Indian Accounting Standards (IAS) have to harmonize and integrate with International Accounting Standards by which harmonization of various accounting policies, practices and principles could take place.	Facts
In its origin, an accounting standard is the policy document.	None
In matters of recognition of various items of income, expenditure, assets and liabilities, the aim is to achieve standards norms which would help to reflect true and fair view of the accounts of a company.	None
Every Indian and foreign investor partner before entering into joint venture agreement(s) with its counterpart examines the financial statements and tries to ascertain the real income of the Indian company.	None
With globalization, we have conventional orthodox system of accounting (recognition, measurement and disclosure) visavis modern system of advanced accountancy.	None
Therefore, the role of accounting has undergone a revolutionary change with the passage of time.	None
Traditionally, accounting was considered solely a historical description of financial activities.	None
That view is no longer acceptable.	None
Accounting is now considered as a service activity.	None
Its function is to provide quantitative information, primarily of financial nature about the economic entities.	None
Accounting today includes several branches, e.g., Financial Accounting, Management Accounting and Government Accounting.	None
The primary role of accounting is to provide an effective measurement and reporting system.	None
This is possible only when accounting is based on certain coherent set of logical principles that constitute the general frame of reference for evaluation and development of sound accounting practices.	None
That is why, we have different accounting concepts and fundamental accounting assumptions, such as, separate entity concept, going concern concept, accrual concept, matching concept etc Therefore, Accounting Standards are based on a number of accounting principles.	None
For example, the Matching Principle and Fair Valuation principle.	None
Historically, matching principles ensured that costs incurred matched with revenues they generated, though they resulted in assets and liabilities in the balancesheet at other than fair values.	None
Similarly, they resulted in assets, which were not assets in the real sense, e.g., deferred revenue expenditure.	None
However, the matching principles ensured purity of the profit and loss statement.	None
Therefore, matching principles ensure ascertainment of true income.	None
Today under Advanced Accountancy, matching principles recognizes not only costs against revenue but also against the relevant time period to determine the Periodic Income.	None
Therefore, matching principle today forms an important component of Accrual Basis of Accounting.	None
On the other hand, Fair Valuation principles are important in the context of valuing derivatives and other investments.	None
If one were to describe one single change in accounting practice over the last few years, it would be the use of Fair Valuation principles.	None
Today, the object behind enactment of A.S., which are now made mandatory under section 211(3A) of the Companies Act, is to shift from historical method of accounting to fair valuation.	None
In the case of mergers and acquisitions, which is common today in the world of globalization, fair valuation principles have important role to play.	None
Mergers and acquisitions are sometimes undertaken to defer revenue expenditure over future years by invoking the matching concept, which results in putting fictitious assets on the balancesheet.	None
This is one reason why fair valuation principles are accepted.	None
A.S. are established rules relating to recognition, measurement and disclosures thereby ensuring that all enterprises that follow them are comparable and that their financial statements are true and fair.	None
Measurements and disclosures based on fair value are becoming increasingly important.	None
Fair valuation is generally used in valuation and disclosure of financial instruments, derivatives, conversions, auctions in a bond, business combinations, impairment of assets, retirement obligations, transactions involving exchange of assets without monetary consideration, transfer pricing, etc.	None
In conclusion, the importance of the Preface is to show a paradigm shift in the thinking of Accountants all over the world, particularly with the comingin of the abovementioned new concepts.	None
Doctrine of Ultra Vires At the outset, we may state that on account of globalization and socioeconomic problems (including income disparities in our economy) the power of Delegation has become a constituent element of legislative power as a whole.	None
However, as held in the case of Indian Express Newspaper v. Union of India reported in (1985) 1 SCC 641 at page 689, subordinate legislation does not carry the same degree of immunity which is enjoyed by a statute passed by a competent Legislature.	None
Subordinate legislation may be questioned on any of the grounds on which plenary legislation is questioned.	None
In addition, it may also be questioned on the ground that it does not conform to the statute under which it is made.	None
It may further be questioned on the ground that it is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act or that it is contrary to some other statute applicable on the same subject matter.	None
Therefore, it has to yield to plenary legislation.	None
It can also be questioned on the ground that it is manifestly arbitrary and unjust.	None
That, any inquiry into its vires must be confined to the grounds on which plenary legislation may be questioned, to the grounds that it is contrary to the statute under which it is made, to the grounds that it is contrary to other statutory provisions or on the ground that it is so patently arbitrary that it cannot be said to be inconformity with the statute.	None
It can also be challenged on the ground that it violates Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
Subordinate legislation cannot be questioned on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice on which administrative action may be questioned.	None
A distinction must, however, be made between delegation of a legislative function in which case the question of reasonableness cannot be gone into and the investment by the statute to exercise a particular discretionary power.	None
In the latter case, the question may be considered on all grounds on which administrative action may be questioned, such as, nonapplication of mind, taking irrelevant matters into consideration, failure to take relevant matters into consideration etc A subordinate legislation may be struck down as arbitrary or contrary to statute if it fails to take into account vital facts which expressly or by necessary implication are required to be taken into account by the statute or the Constitution.	None
This can be done on the ground that the subordinate legislation does not conform to the statutory or constitutional requirements or that it offends Article 14 or Article 19 of the Constitution.	None
However, it may be noted that, a notification issued under a section of the statute which requires it to be laid before Parliament does not make any substantial difference as regards the jurisdiction of the Court to pronounce on its validity.	None
Apart from the grounds referred to by this Court in the above judgment in the case of Indian Express Newspaper, it is important to bear in mind that where the validity of subordinate legislation is challenged, the question to be asked is whether the power given to the rule making authority (in the present case the Central Government under section 642(1) of the Companies Act) is exercised for the purpose for which it is given.	None
Before reaching the conclusion that the Rule is intra vires (we have to begin with the presumption that the Rule is intra vires), the court has to examine the nature, object and the scheme of the legislation as a whole and in that context, the court has to consider what is the Area over which powers are given by the section under which the Rule Making Authority is to act.	None
However, the court has to start with the presumption that the impugned Rule is intra vires.	None
This approach means that, the Rule has to be read down only to save it from being declared ultra vires if the court finds in a given case that the above presumption stands rebutted.	None
If the impugned rule is a delegated legislation it would follow that the said rule is made in exercise of the power conferred by the statute.	None
Legislature has wide powers of delegation.	None
This, however, is subject to one limitation, namely, it cannot delegate uncontrolled power.	None
Delegation is valid only when it is confined to legislative policy and guidelines.	None
In the present case, abovementioned guideline is provided by section 211(1), which has brought in a standalone concept of true and fair accounting.	None
The said concept is the controlling consideration.	None
As stated above, delegation is valid when it is confined to Legislative Policy and Guidelines which are adequately laid down and the delegate is only empowered to implement such Policy within the Guidelines laid down by the Legislature (see TISCO v. The Workmen ors.	None
reported in AIR 1972 SC 1917 )	None
In the present case, we are required to consider the scope of section 642(1), which refers to the power of Central Government (rule making authority) to make rules vis a vis section 641, which states that subject to the provision of the section, the Central Government may, by Notification in the Official Gazette, alter any of the regulations, rules, forms, tables and other provisions contained in any of the Schedules to the Companies Act (including Schedule VI).	None
This aspect is of some importance.	None
Section 642 is in addition to the powers conferred by section 641, therefore, the two sections form part of the same scheme.	None
However, the scope of section 641 is different from the scope of section 642.	None
Power to alter any provision of the Schedules and the power to carry out gapfilling exercise are both entrusted to the Central Government.	None
The expression in addition to in section 642 indicates that both the above sections constitute one scheme.	None
However, section 642 enables Central Government to provide details and, therefore, under section 642 the rules contemplated refers to gapfilling exercise.	None
It is well settled that, what is permitted by the concept of delegation is delegation of ancillary or subordinate legislative functions or what is fictionally called as power to fill up the details.	None
The judgments of this Court have laid down that the Legislature may, after laying down the legislative policy, confer discretion on administrative or executive agency like Central Government to work out details within the framework of the legislative policy laid down in the plenary enactment.	None
Therefore, power to supplement the existing law is not abdication of essential legislative function.	None
Therefore, power to make subordinate legislation is derived from the enabling Act and it is fundamental principle of law which is selfevident that the delegate on whom such power is conferred has to act within the limitations of the authority conferred by the Act.	None
It is equally well settled that, Rules made on matters permitted by the Act in order to supplement the Act and not to supplant the Act, cannot be held to be in violation of the Act.	Reasoning
A delegate cannot override the Act either by exceeding the authority or by making provisions inconsistent with the Act.	None
(See Britnell v. Secretary of State 1991 (2) AllER 726 at 730)	Reasoning
The issue before us in the present batch of civil appeals is whether the Central Government, which is the rule making authority, has overridden the Companies Act, 1956 either by exceeding its authority in adopting AS 22 or by making provisions inconsistent with sections 209 and 211 read with Part I and Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act as alleged by the appellants.	None
Since the said issue has two parts, for the sake of convenience, the first point which needs to be decided is as follows Whether the impugned Rule adopting AS 22 is in excess of the powers conferred upon Central Government under section 642(1) of the Companies Act, 1956?	None
In the case of Banarsi Das v. State of M.P. reported in AIR 1958 SC 909 the State had issued a Notification under section 6(2) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Act, 1947 amending Item 33 in Schedule II by substituting for the words goods sold to or by the State Government by the words goods sold by the State Government.	None
As a result of the said Notification, amending the schedule, the assessee who was entitled for exemption from payment of sales tax in respect of goods sold to the State Government could no longer claim such exemption by reason of the said Notification.	None
That Notification was challenged on the ground that it was not open to the Government in exercise of the authority delegated to it under section 6(2) to modify or alter what the Legislature had enacted and, therefore, the said Notification was bad as being unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.	None
It was argued on behalf of the assessee that earlier they had been granted exemption under section 6(1) of the Act which subsisted when the impugned Notification came to be issued and that in consequences, while an exemption under section 6(1) existed any amendment to the Schedule under section 6(2) was bad as it had the effect of deletion of the exemption which had been granted.	None
Section 6(1) of the Act contemplated exemption to be given by the State Government on certain types of transactions whereas section 6(2) empowered the State Government to amend the schedule.	None
It is in this context that the question arose as to whether the impugned Notification was bad as being an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority.	None
The said contention was rejected by this Court stating that the two subsections together constituted integral part of a single enactment.	None
We quote hereinbelow para 11 of the said judgment, which reads as follows The contention of the appellant that the notification in question is ultra vires must, in our opinion, fail on another ground.	None
The basic assumption on which the argument of the appellant proceeds is that the power to amend the schedule conferred on the Government under section 6(2) is wholly independent of the grant of exemption under section 6(1) of the Act, and that, in consequence, while an exemption under section 6(1) would stand, an amendment thereof by a notification under section 6(2) might be bad.	None
But that, in our opinion, is not the correct interpretation of the section.	None
The two subsections together form integral parts of a single enactment, the object of which is to grant exemption from taxation in respect of such goods and to such extent as may from time to time be determined by the State Government.	None
Section 6(1), therefore, cannot have an operation independent of section 6(2), and an exemption granted thereunder is conditional and subject to any modification that might be issued under section 6(2).	None
In this view, the impugned notification is intra vires and not open to challenge.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
77.,Applying the tests laid down in the aforestated judgment to the present case, it may be noted that, in this case, we are concerned only with the existence and the extent of the powers given to the Central Government to make rules, both for altering the Schedules to the Companies Act as well as to fill in details.	None
Power to alter the Schedule as well as power to fill in details are two distinct powers.	Reasoning
However, both the powers are entrusted to the same delegate, namely, the Central Government.	Reasoning
Further, as stated above, sections 641 and 642 form part of the same scheme, hence, it cannot be said that merely because the impugned Notification has been issued under section 642 and not under section 641 the said Notification is exhaustive of the powers given to the Central Government to frame rules under the aforestated two sections.	Reasoning
Moreover, in the present case, section 642(1) begins with the expression in addition to the powers conferred by section 641, therefore, one has to read section 641 as an additional power given to the Central Government to make Rules, in addition to its power to alter the schedule by making appropriate Rules under section 641.	Reasoning
There is one more way of looking at the arguments.	Reasoning
The Companies Act has been enacted to consolidate and amend the law relating to companies and certain other associations.	Reasoning
Under section 211(3A) Accounting Standards framed by National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards constituted under section 210A are now made mandatory.	Reasoning
Every company has to comply with the said standards.	Reasoning
Similarly, under section 227(3)(d), every auditor has to certify whether the PL a c and balancesheet comply with the accounting standards referred to in section 211(3)(c).	Reasoning
Similarly, under section 211(1) the company accounts have to reflect true and fair view of the state of affairs.	Reasoning
Therefore, the object behind insistence on compliance with the A.S. and true and fair accrual is the presentation of accounts in a manner which would reflect the true income profit.	Reasoning
One has, therefore, to look at the entire scheme of the Companies Act.	Reasoning
In our view, the provisions of the Companies Act together with the Rules framed by the Central Government constitute a complete scheme.	Reasoning
Without the Rules, the Companies Act cannot be implemented.	None
The impugned Rules framed under section 642 are a legitimate aid to construction of the Companies Act as contemporanea expositio.	None
Many of the provisions of the Companies Act, like computation of book profit, net profit etc. cannot be put into operation without the rules.	None
In the case of P. Kasilingam and ors.	None
v. P.S.G. College of Technology and ors.	None
1995 Suppl(2)	None
SCC 348 vide para 20 this Court ruled as follows The Rules have been made in exercise of the power conferred by Section 53 of the Act.	None
Under Section 54(2) of the Act every rule made under the Act is required to be placed on the table of both Houses of the Legislature as soon as possible after it is made.	None
It is accepted principle of statutory construction that rules made under a statute are a legitimate aid to construction of the statute as contemporanea expositio (See Craies on Statute Law , 7th Edn., pp.	None
157158	None
Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. v. Gram Panchayat, Pimpri Waghere (1976) 4 SCC 177.)	None
Rule 2(b) and Rule 2(d) defining the expression College and Director can, therefore, be taken into consideration as contemporanea expositio for construing the expression private college in Section 2(8) of the Act.	None
Moreover, the Act and the Rules form part of a composite scheme.	Reasoning
Many of the provisions of the Act can be put into operation only after the relevant provision or form is prescribed in the Rules.	None
In the absence of the Rules the Act cannot be enforced.	None
If it is held that Rules do not apply to technical educational institutions the provisions of the Act cannot be enforced in respect of such institutions.	None
There is, therefore, no escape from the conclusion that professional and technical educational institutions are excluded from the ambit of the Act and the High Court has rightly taken the said view.	None
Since we agree with the view of the High Court that professional and technical educational institutions are not covered by the Act and the Rules, we do not consider it necessary to go into the question whether the provisions of the Act fall within the ambit of Entry 25 of List III and do not relate to Entry 66 of List I. (emphasis supplied)	None
To the same effect is the judgment of this Court in the case of TELCO v. Gram Panchayat, Pimpri Waghere reported in (1976) 4 SCC 177 in which the Court was required to consider the definition of the word house under the Rules framed in 1934.	None
It was held that the rules provided internal legitimate aid for the interpretation of the words and phrases used in the main enactment.	None
In the present case also even under the Rules impugned herein AS 22, which is made mandatory, provides an internal legitimate aid to the meaning of the words in the Companies Act, including Schedule VI, namely, liability, provision for taxes on income, book profit, net profit, depreciation, amortization etc	None
Therefore, it cannot be said that the impugned Rules framed under section 642(1) constitute an act on the part of the rule making authority, namely, the Central Government, in excess of its powers under section 642(1) of the Companies Act.	Reasoning
In our view, the impugned Rule Notification is valid.	Reasoning
It has nexus with the matters entrusted to the Central Government to be covered by appropriate rules.	Reasoning
Therefore, in our view, the impugned Rule is valid as it has nexus with statutory functions entrusted to Central Government which is the rule making authority under the Act.	Reasoning
It is important to bear in mind that the power to regulate a business or profession implies the power to prescribe and enforce all such proper reasonable rules as may be deemed necessary to conduct business profession in a proper and orderly manner and the power includes the power to prescribe conditions under which business profession can be carried on.	None
(See Deepak Theatre, Dhuri v. State of Punjab and ors.	None
AIR 1992 SC 1519 at page 1521).	None
The Scheme of the Companies Act indicates that Accounting Standards are made mandatory.	None
They have to be followed by the auditors.	None
They have to be followed by the companies.	None
The Accounting Standards provide discipline.	None
They provide harmonization of concepts.	None
They provide harmonization of accounting principles.	None
In the past, when Accounting Standards were not mandatory, various companies used to follow alternate system of accounting.	None
This led to overstatement of profits.	None
Therefore, the said Standards have now been made mandatory.	None
In our view, it is the statutory function given to the Central Government to frame Accounting Standards in consultation with the National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NAC) under section 211(3C).	None
It is not necessary for the Central Government to adopt in every case the Accounting Standards issued by the Institute.	None
Nothing prevents the Central Government from enacting its own Accounting Standards which may not be in consonance with the Standards prescribed by the Institute.	None
Similarly, nothing prevents the Central Government from adopting the Standards issued by that Institute as is the case in the present matter.	None
Therefore, in our view, the impugned Rule is valid as it has nexus with the statutory functions entrusted to the Rule making authority, namely, the Central Government.	Reasoning
Whether the impugned Rule is incongruous contrary to sections 209 and 211 read with the provisions of Part I and Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956 and whether the said Rule seeks to modify the essential features of the Companies Act ?	None
Concepts To answer the above question, we need to examine the following concepts prevalent in Accounting.	None
Accrual System of Accounting In the conventional sense, amounts which become receivables recoverable are shown as income actually received and the liabilities incurred are shown as amounts actually disbursed in a given year.	None
Therefore, under the aforestated system of accounting, entries are posted in the books of accounts on the date of the transaction, i.e., on the date on which rights accrue or liabilities are incurred, irrespective of the date of payment.	None
In such cases, a company has to account for its income or loss as per the above system and not otherwise, if that company has adopted mercantile system of accounting which is also known as accrual system of accounting.	None
However, accrual does not mean confinement of items of revenue expenditure to a given year.	None
As stated above, mergers and acquisitions are undertaken to defer revenue expenditure over future years by invoking matching principles.	None
Therefore, the said principle forms an important part of accrual accounting.	None
Taxes on Income (TOI)	None
It is an important item of PL a c. Taxes on income are considered as expenses incurred by a company in earning revenues.	None
It is an expense which is recognized in the same period as revenue and expense to which they relate.	None
This is called as matching principle.	None
Such matching, results in what is called as Timing Differences.	None
Tax effects of Timing Differences are included as tax expense in the statement of profit and loss and as deferred tax asset (DTA) or as deferred tax liability (DTL) in the balancesheet.	None
In short, deferred tax should be recognized for timing differences.	None
This is the basic mandate of AS 22.	None
This mandate is based on an important principle of accounting, namely, that very transaction has a tax effect.	None
However, DTA is subject to the principle of prudence and certainty that in future the company will have adequate income.	None
This principle of prudence states that DTAs are recognized and carried forward only to the extent of their being a reasonable certainty of their realization, i.e., in future there would be taxable income.	None
Therefore, under the rule of prudence, DTAs are to be recognized only to the extent of their being timing differences, the reversal whereof will result in sufficient taxable income in future against which they can be realized.	None
On the other hand, DTL is to be recognized as liability under the said standard as it results in future cash outflow in the form of payments to the Income tax Department in the case of TOIs.	None
Current Tax Current tax has to be measured by using the applicable tax rates.	None
This is because current tax has to be measured at the amount expected to be paid to the Income tax Department by way of tax.	None
Not only the tax rates, but also tax laws constitute the basis for measuring the amount of tax expected to be paid to the Income tax Department.	None
It is important to note that while measuring current tax, companies have to go by the balancesheet date.	None
The company has to examine the tax rates and the tax laws on that date.	None
Timing Differences They are differences which arises because the period in which some items of revenue and expenses are included in the taxable income do not tally with the period in which items are considered to compute the Accounting Income.	None
In other words, it recognizes expenses against the relevant time period to determine the periodic income.	None
This concept has been brought in after the amendment to section 211(1) of the Companies Act which emphasizes that after 2001 the companies shall prepare their accounts so as to reflect true and fair view of the State of Affairs and to obliterate the difference between Accounting and Taxable Income.	None
This concept bridges the gap between accounting income and taxable income.	None
Deferred tax is the tax effect of such differences which are now required to be accounted for.	None
As stated above, Accounting Standards today constitute a paradigm shift from the conventional system of accounting based on Historical Costs Method towards Fair Valuation Principles.	None
Similarly, in the past, companies used to follow alternate system of accounting.	None
The Accounting Standards today are trying to harmonize different accounting concepts and principles and, therefore, timing differences play an important role in harmonizing the matching principle under accrual system of accounting with the Fair Valuation Principles.	None
The object is to achieve proper presentation of balancesheet and PL a c.	None
The object is to present before the investors, shareholders and other stakeholders the book profits (real income) of the company.	None
The tax effect of timing difference under AS 22 has to be included in the tax expenses in the PL a c as DTA or DTL in the balancesheet.	None
Therefore, timing difference is the tax effect which forms part of tax expense in the PL a c.	None
The primary object of AS 22 adopted by the impugned Rule is to prescribe an accounting treatment for TOI.	None
In accordance with the matching concept, TOIs are recognized in the same period as revenue and expenses to which they relate.	None
Matching of TOI against revenue for a period poses problems due to the effect that in a number of cases, taxable income is different from accounting income.	None
This difference arises for two reasons.	None
Firstly, there are differences between items of revenue and expenses in the PL a c and items considered as revenue expenses or taken for tax purposes.	None
Secondly, there are differences between the amount in respect of a particular item of revenue or expenses as recognized in the PL a c and the corresponding amount which is recognized for computing taxable income.	None
Tax Expense As stated above, current tax is the amount of income tax determined to be payable in respect of taxable income for a period.	None
On the other hand, deferred tax is the tax effect of Timing Differences.	None
As stated above, Timing Differences are differences between taxable income and accounting income for a given period.	None
Timing Difference originates in one period, but it is capable of reversal in one or more subsequent period(s).	None
As stated above, every transaction has a tax effect, therefore, tax expense is the sum total of current tax deferred tax charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss for the given period.	None
Therefore, tax expense for that period has to be included in the Net Profit.	None
Therefore, we see no inconsistency between liability as understood in the conventional sense and DTL as submitted on behalf of the appellants.	None
Assets Assets represent expenditure.	None
When an expenditure is written off for accounting purposes in the year in which it is incurred but is admissible as deduction for tax purposes over a period of time then in such cases, the asset representing expenditure would have a balance only for tax purposes but not for accounting purposes.	None
The difference between the balance of the assets for tax purposes and the balance for accounting purposes would be a timing difference which will reverse in future when the expenditure would be allowed for tax purposes.	None
In such a case, DTA would be recognized in respect of the timing difference, subject to the principle of prudence.	None
This concept is important while deciding the question as to whether para 33 of AS 22 (transitional provision) is or is not inconsistent with the provisions of Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	None
Matching Principle 828 Matching Concept is based on the accounting period concept.	None
The paramount object of running a business is to earn profit.	None
In order to ascertain the profit made by the business during a period, it is necessary that revenues of the period should be matched with the costs (expenses) of that period.	None
In other words, income made by the business during a period can be measured only with the revenue earned during a period is compared with the expenditure incurred for earning that revenue.	None
However, in cases of mergers and acquisitions, companies sometimes undertake to defer revenue expenditure over future years which brings in the concept of Deferred Tax Accounting.	None
Therefore, today it cannot be said that the concept of accrual is limited to one year.	None
It is a principle of recognizing costs (expenses) against revenues or against the relevant time period in order to determine the periodic income.	None
This principle is an important component of accrual basis of accounting.	None
As stated above, the object of AS 22 is to reconcile the matching principle with the Fair Valuation Principles.	None
It may be noted that recognition, measurement and disclosure of various items of income, expenses, assets and liabilities is done only by Accounting Standards and not by provisions of the Companies Act.	None
Depreciation As stated above, timing difference is the difference between taxable income and accounting income for a period.	None
Depreciation is one of the important items in computation of income, be it taxable income or accounting income.	None
According to Pickles Accountancy, fourth edn., at page 0518, depreciation is the inherent decline in the value of an asset from any cause whatsoever.	None
The wearing out of a machine is a simple example of depreciation.	None
In doubleentry system of accounting, there has to be complete doubleentry for depreciation adjustment.	None
The required entry under that system of Depreciation Adjustment is debit Trading and Profit Loss account and credit the asset in respect of which depreciation is being recorded.	None
Such an entry conforms with the principles enunciated, namely, that, the debit to Trading and Profit Loss account is necessary because the amount writtenoff represents an expense and the credit to the asset is required, as the asset has, pro tanto, reduced in value.	None
Therefore, from the above point of view in the principles of accountancy, even distribution in certain cases is treated as expenditure paid out over the years.	None
The object of providing for such distribution is to spread the expenditure incurred in acquiring the assets over its effective lifetime.	None
The amount of provision to be made in respect of the accounting period is intended to represent the portion of such expenditure which has expired during the period.	None
Therefore, in that sense, it is money expended which is spread out over the effective life of an asset.	None
Even under the Income tax Act, Parliament has used the expression allowances and depreciation in several sections in Chapter IV within which section 44A appears.	None
In this connection, reference may be made to section 37 which enjoins that, any expenditure not falling in sections 30 to 36 expended wholly and exclusively or laid out for business purposes should be allowed in computing the business income.	None
Therefore, depreciation and allowances have been dealt with in section 32 and the expression any expenditure in section 37 covers both, allowances and depreciation.	None
See Commissioner of Incometax v. Indian Jute Mills Association (1982) 134 ITR 68 (Cal).	None
Depreciation under Income tax Act is an incentive allowance.	None
However, in commercial accountancy, it is reduction deduction from the value of an asset on the balancesheet.	None
Reserves Provisions In State Bank of Patiala v. CIT reported in (1996) 219 ITR 706 substantial amounts were set apart by the assesseebank as reserves.	None
No amount of bad debt was actually written off or adjusted against the amounts claimed as reserves.	None
No claim for any deduction by way of bad debts was made during the relevant assessment years.	None
The assessee never appropriated any amount against any bad and doubtful debts.	None
The amount remained in the account of the assessee by way of capital and the assessee treated the said amount as reserves and not as provisions designed to meet any liability, contingency, commitment or diminution in the value of assets known to exist on the date of the balancesheet.	None
The question which arose for consideration by this Court was whether amounts set apart in the balancesheet are provisions or reserves.	None
The matter arose under the provisions of Companies (Profits) Surtax Act, 1964 which levied a charge on every company for every assessment year called as surtax, insofar as the chargeable profits of the previous year exceeded the statutory deduction at the rates mentioned in the Third Schedule.	None
Rule (1) of Schedule II stipulated mandatory that the capital of the company shall be the total of the amounts including reserves.	None
The assessee contended that the amounts set apart in the balancesheet are reserves.	None
The Department contended that the said amounts were provisions.	None
The assessee succeeded.	None
However, the reasoning given in the judgment is important.	None
It was held by this Court, after referring to the relevant provisions of the Companies Act regarding the form of balancesheet wherein the words reserves and surplus and current liabilities and provisions are dealt with, that if any retention or appropriation falls within the definition of provision it can never be a reserve but it does not follow that if the retention or appropriation is not a provision it is automatically a reserve.	None
That question has to be decided having regard to the true nature and character of the sum so retained depending on several factors including the intention with which and the purpose for which such retention has been made because the substance of the matter is to be recorded.	None
In the said judgment, it has been further held that if any retention is made to meet depreciation, renewal or diminution in value of asset, the same is not a reserve.	None
In that case, one of the other questions which arose for determination was whether a fund created or a sum of money set apart by assesseebank to meet any liability which the assesseebank can reasonably anticipate on the balancesheet date is equivalent to the case where the liability has actually arisen.	None
The High Court took the view that since the assessee is the banking company, it would be reasonable and legitimate to assume that the bank was in a position to anticipate any liability by way of bad debt on the balancesheet date.	None
This Court held that the aforestated assumption made by the High Court was unjustified.	None
According to this Court, the question to be asked in such cases is whether the liability was known or anticipated on the date when the balancesheet was prepared and not whether the assessee can anticipate on the balancesheet date the debt and doubtful debts.	None
Applying this test to the facts of the present case, the tax effect of the timing difference was known on the date when the balancesheet was prepared and, therefore, AS 22 is right in stipulating that the tax effect of such timing differences should be included in the tax expense in the statement of profit and loss as DTA DTL in the balancesheet.	None
Depreciation in accounting sense is similar to bad and doubtful debts.	None
Provision for bad and doubtful debt like depreciation is not a provision for liability but it is a provision for diminution in value of assets.	None
Where such provision is made and if that provision is not excessive or unreasonable, it is not a reserve, however, any amount in excess of the requirement can be considered to be a reserve.	None
Thus, provision can be made for depreciation, renewal, diminution in the value of an asset or for any known liability.	None
In this case, we are concerned with depreciation mainly because in 99 per cent of the cases the difference between tax depreciation and accounting depreciation results in timing differences.	None
The provision for bad and doubtful debt is always made with reference to debt receivable where there is doubt about full realization of debt.	None
The provision is made in order to cover up the probable diminution in the value of an asset, i.e., debt which is amount receivable.	None
For example, if the receivable is Rs. 1 crore and the assessee is of the opinion that Rs.	None
One crore might not be realized and that only 90 per cent of the debt would be realized and, therefore, he makes a provision for Rs. 10 lacs for bad debts.	None
By making the provision, the assessee is valuing his asset, namely, debt, which is the amount receivable, at Rs. 90 lacs as against the book figure of Rs. 1 crore.	None
Thus, the provision for bad and doubtful debt is the provision for diminution in the value of asset, i.e., debt.	None
Such provision is not a provision for liability, because even if a debt is not recovered, no liability would be fastened upon the assessee.	None
The debt is the amount receivable by the assessee.	None
It is not any liability payable by the assessee.	None
Therefore, any provision towards irrecoverability of debt cannot be said to be provision for liability.	None
It is the provision for diminution in the value of assets.	None
The expression reserve has been defined in a negative manner by clause 7(1)(b) of Part III of Schedule VI to the Companies Act and it only says that the reserve shall not include any amount written off or retained by way of provision for depreciation, renewal, diminution in value of asset or by way of provision for any known liability.	None
Thus, if the provision made by the assessee for depreciation, (diminution in value of the asset) is in excess of the amount which is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which the provision is made, the excess shall be treated as a reserve and not a provision.	None
This aspect is important because the question as to whether the provision made is in excess of the requirement would depend on the facts of each case.	None
This aspect is important also because it has been vehemently argued on behalf of the assessee that AS 22 requires the assessee to make provision for DTL which, in fact, should have been treated as a reserve and not as a provision.	None
Reserve is not a charge to be deducted before arriving at the profit for the period under review.	None
It is appropriation of profit.	None
The reserve account is credited as a result of a debit to the appropriation account and not to the PL a c or revenue account.	None
In a broad sense, all allocations to reserve represent additions to capital.	None
In the case of a provision, unlike reserves, the charge is created as a result of debit to the PL a c and not a debit to the appropriation account.	None
Tax Base	None
The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purpose.	None
As stated above, deferred tax has to be recognized for all timing differences.	None
This is based on the principle that financial statements for a given period should recognize the tax effect, whether current or deferred, of all transactions occurring in a given period.	None
One more principle needs to be noted that assets represent expenditure.	None
Concept of DTL DTA DTL DTA is recognized for all timing differences.	None
AS 22 requires the companies to make a provision for Deferred Tax Accounting with reference to the difference between accounting income and taxable income.	None
In our view, matching principle is an important component of Accrual Accounting.	None
The said principle is not in conflict with accrual accounting as vehemently submitted on behalf of the appellants.	None
Accrual Accounting is the concept recognized by sections 205, 209, 211 and Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	None
However, the said provisions of the Companies Act nowhere lays down as to which asset should be recognized as an investment and the method of valuing investments.	None
That exercise is left to the accounting standards.	None
Similarly, the Companies Act nowhere lays down as to how and when income or expenditure should be measured recognized.	None
That exercise is left to the accounting standards.	None
AS 22 proceeds on the basis that a benefit obtained in one year could be reversed in the subsequent year and, therefore, it has to be recognized as a liability.	None
One more concept needs to be mentioned.	None
Deferred tax is the same as timing difference.	None
It arises on account of the difference between taxable and accounting incomes.	None
This difference arises between items of revenue and expenses as comparing in P L a c visavis items considered as revenue, expenses or deduction for tax purposes.	None
Secondly, difference also arises between the amount in respect of an item of revenue or expenses as recognized in the P L a c and the corresponding amount required in the computation of taxable income.	None
It is the tax effect of time difference which is required to be included in Tax Expense in the P L a c and as DTA DTL in the balancesheet.	None
Timing difference originates in the year in which difference arises between the tax depreciation and accounting depreciation.	None
Therefore, it is a known liability for the current year, though payable in future period(s).	None
Therefore, tax effect of timing difference is a real liability for which a provision is required to be made in the P L a c as well as DTL in the balancesheet.	None
As stated above, deferred tax is the tax effect of timing difference.	None
It has been vehemently submitted that a provision for Matching Tax is required to be made in respect of accounting income only for accounting period.	None
The emphasis is on the words only for accounting period.	None
In our view, even under accrual system of accounting, the accounting period need not be confined to one year alone.	None
As stated hereinabove, mergers and acquisitions today are sometimes undertaken by companies to defer revenue expenditure over future period(s) by invoking the matching concept.	None
Historically, it may also be stated that prior to the introduction of AS 22, the companies used to follow what is called as Tax Payable Method.	None
They were put to notice by the Institute that in future the companies shall have to follow what is called as Tax Effect Accounting method.	None
AS 22 introduces tax effect accounting method.	None
Before us, it has been vehemently urged on behalf of the appellants that, unlike U.K., in India, rates of depreciation are statutorily prescribed under the Companies Act and under the Incometax Act, 1961.	None
According to the appellants, rates of depreciation are not prescribed statutorily in U.K Therefore, in U.K. the tax payer is at liberty to adopt any rate of depreciation and, therefore, there could be justification for invoking the matching principle and for applying AS 22 for deferred taxation.	None
We find no merit in this argument.	None
In our view, on the contrary, since in India we have two separate rates of depreciation statutorily prescribed under two different Acts, introduction of matching principle becomes relevant.	None
Ultimately, AS 22 is for deferred taxation.	None
It brings out for the information of shareholders, investors and stakeholders the hidden liability which earlier could not be brought out.	None
Today, we are living in the world of globalization in which, apart from merger, acquisitions play an important role.	None
The buyer wants to know the income and liabilities of a company.	None
He wants to know the real income of the company, which he proposes to buy.	None
Because of the difference in the rates of depreciation statutorily prescribed under the Incometax Act and the Companies Act, the concept of deferred taxation has been introduced in order to obliterate the difference between accounting depreciation and tax depreciation.	None
Application of above Concepts As stated above, the power to alter the Schedule is distinct and separate from the power to fill in the details, though both together form part of the same scheme.	Reasoning
In the present case, under section 641, the Central Government is empowered vide the Notification to alter any of the Regulations, Rules, Forms and other provisions contained in any of the Schedules except Schedules XI and XII.	None
Under section 641(2), any alteration notified under subsection (1) has the effect as if the notified alteration stood enacted in the parent Act and shall come into force on the date of the Notification, unless the Notification directs otherwise.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the present case, we are concerned with the provision of section 641(2) which is not there in section 642.	None
However, as stated above, section 642 begins with the expression in addition to the powers conferred by section 641.	None
The point which we would like to stress is that though the Central Government is vested with both the powers, namely, to amend the Schedule and to fill in details, the nature of the rules framed under section 641(2) continuous to have the status of the rules despite the phraseology used in section 641(2) which, as stated above, says that any alteration notified under subsection (1) of section 641 shall have effect as if enacted in the Companies Act.	None
To this extent, we are in agreement with the submission made on behalf of the appellants.	None
Our view is supported by the judgment of this Court in the case of Chief Inspector of Mines v. Karam Chand Thapar AIR 1961 SC 838 .	None
We quote hereinbelow	None
para	None
20 of the said judgment, which read as follows The true position appears to be that the Rules and Regulations do not lose their character as rules and regulations, even though they are to be of the same effect as if contained in the Act.	None
They continue to be rules subordinate to the Act, and though for certain purposes, including the purpose of construction, they are to be treated as if contained in the Act, their true nature as subordinate rule is not lost.	None
Therefore, with regard to the effect of a repeal of the Act, they continue to be subject to the operation of Section 24 of the General Clauses Act.	None
101Therefore, in our view, Rules framed under section 641 followed by Rules framed under section 642(1) shall continue to be Rules subordinate to the Companies Act though for the purposes of construction, they are to be treated as forming part of the same scheme.	None
In the present case, the most important question, which we have to decide is whether the impugned Rule adopted AS 22 is contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act and in that connection our judgment proceeds on the basis that the impugned Rule is an example of subordinate legislation.	None
As stated above, tax expense or tax income represents total amount included in the determination of net profit or loss for the period in respect of current tax and deferred tax.	None
DTL is a tax payable in future period(s) which arises out of taxable temporary differences.	None
DTA is the tax recoverable in future period(s) which arises out of deductible temporary difference, carry forward of unused tax losses and carry forward of unused tax credits.	None
Temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balancesheet and its tax base, which is an amount attributable for tax purpose.	None
Taxable temporary difference will result in future period(s) when carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered.	None
It will arise when the tax base of an asset liability is lower than the balancesheet amount.	None
Tax base of an asset gets reduced by overcharge of depreciation as per the tax law.	None
The tax base of a liability gets reduced by overcharge of a liability which is to be written back as income in the future period(s).	None
This analyses can be explained by the following examples Example1	None
A Plant costs Rs. 100 lacs.	None
Accelerated depreciation is charged on the Plant to the extent of Rs. 70 lacs as per the Income tax Rules.	None
Therefore, the tax base of the Plant is (100 70) Rs. 30 lacs.	None
On the other hand, Accounting Depreciation charged as per the Accounting Standard is Rs. 25 lacs.	None
In such a case, the balancesheet value or what is called as depreciated book value of the Plant would be (100 25) Rs. 75 lacs.	None
Therefore, a timing difference has arisen, in the above example, between the depreciated book value (balancesheet value of the Plant) and its tax base.	None
The principle which emerges from the above example is that when tax base is lower than the balancesheet value of the asset (depreciated book value of the Plant) a deferred tax liability emerges.	None
Similarly, the following example will show as to when DTA emerges.	None
Example2	None
Preliminary expenses of Rs. 10 lacs are allowed to be written off over a period of 10 years on a straightline basis, which are charged to the income statement over a period of 5 years.	None
Therefore, after 3 years from the date the expenses are incurred, book value (the balancesheet value) of such preliminary expenses would be Rs. 4 lacs (106) and the tax base will be Rs. 7 lacs (103).	None
In the above example, the tax base of the Plant (asset) at Rs. 7 lacs is higher than the balancesheet value of preliminary expenses at Rs. 4 lacs.	None
There will, therefore, arise deductible timing difference which gives rise to deferred tax asset (DTA).	None
However, a DTA, as stated above, should be recognized for all deductible temporary difference to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible timing difference can be utilized.	None
A DTA should also be recognized for carrying forward the unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized.	None
It is, therefore, necessary to review DTA at each balancesheet date.	None
We would also like to give few more examples of DTA and DTL as follows Example3 Cost of a Plant is Rs. 100 lacs, its carrying amount is Rs. 80 lacs whereas its tax base is Rs. 20 lacs.	None
Therefore, the Taxable Timing Difference is (Rs. 80 20) Rs. 60 lacs.	None
In case the tax rate is 25 per cent then the DTL shall be computed as follows DTL (Taxable Timing Difference) Rs. 60 lacs x (Tax Rate) 25 DTL 60 x 25/100 Rs. 15 lacs Similarly, if a company recognizes its liability for Provident Fund in its accounts at Rs. 30 lacs which is not allowed by the Income tax Department unless actually paid and if the tax rate is 30 per cent then the DTA will be Rs. 30 lacs x 30/100 Rs. 9 lacs as in such a case the tax base is Nil whereas the carrying amount is Rs. 30 lacs.	None
Example4 (Matching Concept)	None
A leasing company deducts an amount of lease equalization charges from lease rental income.	None
For that purpose, the company makes a provision for the said charges in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Institute on Accounting of income, depreciation and other aspects for leasing company.	None
This charge is created to equalize the imbalance between lease rentals and depreciation charges over the period of lease.	None
It is based on the rationale of matching costs with revenues so that the periodic net income from a finance lease is true and fair.	None
Such matching is achieved by showing the lease rentals received under finance lease separately under Gross Income in the PL a c of the relevant period and against such lease rental income, a matching lease annual charge is made to the PL a c.	None
This annual lease charge represents recovery of the net investment fair value of the leased asset over the lease period and is calculated by deducting the finance income for the period from the lease rent for that period.	None
Accordingly, where the annual lease charge is more than the statutory depreciation under the Income tax Act, lease equalization charge account would be debited to that extent whereas when annual lease charge is less than statutory depreciation under the Income tax Act, a lease equalization would emerge.	None
Therefore, lease equalization charge is created as a result of debit to the PL a c.	None
It is a charge which has to be deducted to arrive at the true and correct profit of the leasing business and is neither an appropriation of profit nor a reserve.	None
This example indicates applicability of matching concept.	None
(C)	None
Whether AS 22 is contrary to or inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act.	None
In the case of C.I.T. v. Duncan Brothers Co. Ltd. reported in (1996) 8 SCC 31 the assessee company submitted that provision for taxation made by it for assessment years 196364 and 196465 should be treated as a fund and, therefore, it should be deducted from the cost of asset required to be excluded under Rule 1(ii) of Schedule II to the Super Tax Act, 1963 and Rule 2(ii) of Schedule II to the Companies (Profits) Super Tax Act, 1964 respectively.	None
This contention was rejected.	None
This Court held that since Schedule II to both the Acts pertained to computation of capital, the terms used in Schedule II should be interpreted in the context of the balancesheet of a company and its PL a c which will have to be looked at to ascertain the companys capital and its profits.	None
It was held that a provision for taxation of the kind in question was not a fund etymologically in accounting parlance.	None
It was observed that words of accounting language should be interpreted as understood in accounting practice.	None
Applying the above test to the present case, we are now required to interpret the words the amount of charge for Indian Income tax on profits in clause 3(vi) in Part II of Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	None
Similarly, we are required to interpret the words current liabilities and provisions in the form of balancesheet in Part I of Schedule VI to the Companies Act.	None
Part III of the said Schedule defines the words provision as well as reserve.	None
As stated above, the form of balancesheet is prescribed by Part I of Schedule VI.	None
The Act does not prescribe a proforma of PL a c. However, Part II of Schedule VI prescribes the particulars which must be furnished in a PL a c. As far as possible, the PL a c must be drawn up according to the requirements of Part II of Schedule VI.	None
As stated above, section 211(1) emphasizes true and fair view in place of true and correct view of accounting.	None
As stated above, the legislative policy is to obliterate the difference between the accounting income and the taxable income.	None
As stated above, the accounting income book profit is the real income.	Facts
Therefore, section 211(1) emphasizes the concept of true and fair view.	None
As stated above, it is a standalone consideration.	None
It is the controlling element underlying the scheme of sections 209, 211 and 227.	None
However, as stated above, the Companies Ac does not deal with Recognition, Measurement and Disclosure.	None
As stated above, how much amount should be recognized in respect of a specific matter is not covered by section 209(3)(b).	None
Recognition, measurement and disclosure are the three items which can only be done by way of Accounting Standards and not by the provisions of the Companies Act.	None
This aspect is important because under section 642(1) the Central Government is empowered to carry out ancillary subordinate legislative functions which is also fictionally called as power to fillup the details.	None
Under section 211(1) Parliament has laid down the controlling consideration in presentation of balancesheet and PL a c by companies and it has thereafter conferred discretion on Central Government to work out details within the framework of that Policy.	None
Presentation of balancesheet and PL a c is different from recognition, measurement and disclosure of various items of revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities etc That part has been left to the Central Government which is empowered to enact Accounting Standards in consultation with National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NAC), which committee is to be established and which has been established under section 210A(1).	None
As stated above, the Central Government is the rule making authority.	None
As stated above, it is not bound to go by the recommendations of the Institute in the matter of framing of accounting standards.	None
Generally, it follows such recommendations.	None
However, in law nothing prevents the Central Government from enacting accounting standards in consultation with NAC which are in variance from the Standards prescribed by the Institute.	None
In the present case, we are concerned with the accounting standards prescribed by Central Government in consultation with NAC under section 642(1) of the Companies Act.	None
In the present case, the main objection of the appellants is against paragraphs 9 and 33 of AS 22.	None
Para 9 reads as under Tax expense for the period, comprising current tax and deferred tax, should be included in the determination of the net profit or loss for the period.	None
Para 33 of AS 22 reads as under On the first occasion that the taxes on income are accounted for in accordance with this Statement, the enterprise should recognise, in the financial statements, the deferred tax balance that has accumulated prior to the adoption of this Statement as deferred tax asset liability with a corresponding credit charge to the revenue reserves, subject to the consideration of prudence in case of deferred tax assets (see paragraphs 1518).	None
The amount so credited charged to the revenue reserves should be the same as that which would have resulted if this Statement had been in effect from the beginning.	None
As regards para 9, the appellants had no objection to the disclosure of DTL DTA in their financial statements.	None
They object to a charge being created qua PL a c for DTL mainly because it results in reduction of reserves and net profits.	None
Therefore, the main contention is that the DTL is a notional concept.	None
According to the appellants, DTL is not a liability.	None
Therefore, according to the appellants, there cannot be a charge for DTL to the PL a c of the company.	None
According to the appellants, DTL distorts their financial statements.	None
According to the appellants, Schedule VI forms part of the Companies Act.	None
According to the appellants Part II of Schedule VI contains clause 3(vi).	None
According to the appellants, the said clause 3(vi) refers to the amount of charge for income tax on the profits.	None
According to the appellants when AS 22 states that tax expense for the period shall consist of current tax and deferred tax and that such tax expense should be included in the determination of net profit or loss, it amounts to alteration of clause 3(vi) of Schedule VI to the Companies Act which is the part thereof.	None
According to the appellants, Rules framed by the Central Government as a delegate under section 642 cannot alter the provisions of the Companies Act including Schedule VI.	None
We have dealt with this aspect in the earlier paragraphs.	None
However, the appellants have further contended that para 9 of AS 22 is inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act including Schedule VI and, therefore, void.	None
It is also contended on behalf of the appellants that section 211 deals with PL a c and balancesheet.	None
That, para 9 only refers to filling in the details qua items in PL a c and balancesheet.	None
According to the appellants, PL a c and balancesheet do not constitute primary books of accounts.	None
According to the appellants, deferred taxation do not form part of accrual system of accounting.	None
According to the appellants para 9 of AS 22 requires the company to make provision for liability or taxation in the balancesheet and PL a c, further, according to the appellants PL a c and balancesheet do not constitute books of accounts and, therefore, according to the appellants, such a standard brings about inconsistency between maintenance of books of accounts which are primary documents on one hand and balancesheet an PL a c on the other hand.	None
According to the appellants, para 9 of AS 22 does not touch the subject maintenance of books of accounts.	None
That, it only touches the presentation of balancesheet and PL a c.	None
According to the appellants, books of accounts constitute primary documents and if para 9 does not apply to the maintenance of books of accounts, para 9 cannot be made applicable only to balancesheet and PL a c because if it is so permitted it would bring about inconsistency between maintenance of books of accounts under section 209 visavis presentation of financial statements under section 211.	None
In short, according to the appellants para 9 and para 33 of AS 22 are inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act including Schedule VI.	None
We do not find any merit in the arguments of the appellants on the point of inconsistency.	None
As stated above, recognition and measurements bring in the concept of fair value.	None
When a financial instrument is measured at fair value it brings transparency in financial reporting.	None
Today, companies undertake multifarious activities which warrants segment reporting.	None
For example in RIL we have three segments, namely, refining, industry and infrastructure.	None
Similarly, in the case of Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., it has different segments.	None
Each segment earns its own revenue.	None
For example, revenue from copper, revenue from aluminium and revenue from others.	None
Under clause 3(vi) of Part II nonprovision for taxation would amount to contravention of the provisions of sections 209 and 211 of the Companies Act.	None
Accordingly, it is necessary for the auditor to say in what manner the accounts do not disclose a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the PL a c of the company.	None
AS 22 is mandatory.	None
Therefore, it is the duty of the members of the Institute to examine whether the accounting standard is complied with the said standard in the presentation of financial statement.	None
see also section 227(3)(d)	None
In our view, para 9 only provides for details which are necessary for giving effect to the concept of true and fair accrual of accounts contemplated by section 211(1).	None
As stated above, the concept of true and correct accrual is different from the concept of true and fair accrual.	None
Both the concepts fall under accrual system of accounting.	None
However, there is a difference.	None
Under true and correct accrual, the matching principle was always recognized.	None
However, fair valuation principle is the concept which brings out the real income of the company.	None
Para 9 has been enacted, as stated above, to obliterate the difference between the accounting income and taxable income.	None
Para 9 aims to present the real income to the investors, shareholders and stakeholders in the company.	None
As stated above, there is also a difference between accounting depreciation and tax depreciation.	None
In order to harmonize these differences, para 9 has been enacted.	None
As stated above, true and fair view is the basic requirement in the matter of presentation of balancesheet and PL a c.	None
Therefore, in order to bring out the true income of a company, one has to read the provisions of the Companies Act with the accounting standards adopted by the impugned Notification.	None
As held in the judgment of P. Kasilingam (supra) there are statute under which the rules provide an internal aid to the construction of the words used in the parent Act.	None
The Companies Act uses the words like, provision, reserve, liability etc.	None
in the accounting sense and as held in the case of Duncan Brothers (supra) the words of accounting language should be interpreted as understood in accounting practice.	None
Therefore, in our view, para 9 of AS 22 merely provides for details in the matter of provision for liability for taxation.	None
The word tax expense in para 9 under conservative system of accounting was confined to current tax.	None
However, with para 9 of AS 22 coming into force, the word tax expense now includes both, current tax and deferred tax.	None
This inclusion became necessary because of developments not only in concepts but also in accounting practices.	None
This inclusion becomes necessary if one has to go by paradigm shift from historical costs accounting to fair value principles.	None
In our view, with the insertion of the words true and fair view in section 211, which is the requirement in the matter of presentation of balancesheet and PL a c the rule making authority was entitled to include the concept of deferred tax in tax expense.	None
It may be stated that under clause 3(vi) of Part II, Schedule VI the charge for tax on profit is contemplated.	None
Provision for liability for taxation is contemplated by the said clause.	None
Para 9 of AS 22 merely provides for a liability which arises on account of timing difference as explained hereinabove.	None
As stated above, it is known on the balancesheet date.	None
One has to therefore consider matching principle and fair valuation principles as important concepts in Accrual Accounting.	None
Further, as stated above, recognition and measurement is not covered by the provisions of the Companies Act, therefore, one has to read the presentation of balancesheet and PL a c together with recognition and measurements.	None
Therefore, one has to read the provisions of the Companies Act along with the impugned Rule which adopts AS 22 as recommended by the Institute.	None
The matching principle recognizes cost against revenue or against the relevant time period to determine the periodic income.	None
Therefore, the said principle constitutes an important component of the accrual basis of accounting.	None
The concept of accrual, in case of mergers and acquisition, is not limited to one year.	None
DTL DTA arises out of timing differences.	None
Therefore, such differences have got to be reflected in Deferred Tax Accounting.	None
DTL in most cases arises on account of the difference between tax depreciation and accounting depreciation.	None
When on account of overcharging of depreciation under the Incometax Rules, the taxable income falls below the accounting income, DTL emerges.	None
This is because the rates of tax depreciation are incentive rates whereas accounting depreciation is based on the useful life of the asset.	None
Thus, an asset under Income tax Act would be charged over a much shorter period as compared to the useful life of the asset.	None
If the useful life of the asset is 10 years, for tax purposes it should be written off fully in 4 years.	None
Thus, in the first year in which tax depreciation is higher than the accounting depreciation, the taxable income would be less than the accounting income, which would give rise to DTL on account of the difference between the amount of depreciation, i.e., the timing difference, which arises as it relates to the depreciation amounts for that particular year.	None
It would become payable in future years when the timing difference reverses, i.e., when the taxable income becomes higher than the accounting income.	None
Therefore, it is called as DTL.	None
It is so called because it results in future cash outflow on account of the timing difference.	None
Hereinbelow, we are required to give two illustrations to indicate as to how the DTL emerges out of timing differences and, secondly, the application of Fair Valuation principles in advanced accounting.	None
Illustration 1 A company, ABC Ltd., prepares its accounts annually on 31st March.	None
On 1st April, 20x1, it purchases a machine at a cost of Rs.1,50,000.	None
The machine has a useful life of three years and an expected scrap value of zero.	None
Although it is eligible for a 100 first year depreciation allowance for tax purposes, the straightline method is considered appropriate for accounting purposes.	None
ABC Ltd. has profits before depreciation and taxes of Rs.2,00,000 each year and the corporate tax rate is 40 per cent each year.	None
The purchase of machine at a cost of Rs.1,50,000 in 20x1 gives rise to a tax saving of Rs.60,000.	None
If the cost of the machine is spread over three years of its life for accounting purposes, the amount of the tax saving should also be spread over the same period as shown below Statement of Profit and Loss (for the three years ending 31st March, 20x1, 20x2, 20x3)(Rupees in thousands)20x1 20x2 20x3Profit before depreciationand taxes 200 200 200Less Depreciation for accountingPurposes 50 50 50Profit before taxes 150 150 150Less Tax expenseCurrent tax0.40 (200150) 200.40(200) 80 80Deferred taxTax effect of timing differences originating during the year0.40(15050) 40Tax effect of timing differences reversing during the year0.40 (050) (20) (20)Tax expense 60 60 60Profit after tax 90 90 90Net timing differences 100 50 0Deferred tax liability 40 20 0In 20x1, the amount of depreciation allowed for tax purposes exceeds the amount of depreciation charged for accounting purposes by Rs.1,00,000 and, therefore, taxable income is lower than the accounting income.	None
This gives rise to a deferred tax liability of Rs.40,000.	None
In 20x2 and 20x3, accounting income is lower than taxable income because the amount of depreciation charged for accounting purposes exceeds the amount of depreciation allowed for tax purposes by Rs.50,000 each year.	None
Accordingly, deferred tax liability is reduced by Rs.20,000 each in both the years.	None
As may be seen, tax expense is based on the accounting income of each period.	None
In 20x1, the profit and loss account is debited and deferred tax liability account is credited with the amount of tax on the originating timing difference of Rs.1,00,000 while in each of the following two years, deferred tax liability account is debited and profit and loss account is credited with the amount of tax on the reversing timing difference of Rs.50,000.	None
Illustration2 (Application of Fair Value Principles)	None
A convertible debenture is normally presented in the financial statements as a liability, while it has two components a liability and an option to convert loan into equity.	None
Appropriate accounting principle requires separate accounting for rights and obligations.	None
Each component has to be separately accounted for.	None
In the past, many of those rights and obligations were shown as offbalancesheet items.	None
Only recently, on account of accounting standards, the number of such items stand reduced.	None
The issuer of a financial instrument is required to classify convertible debentures (financial instrument) as liability or as equity depending on the terms of the contract.	None
A convertible debenture is a compound instrument.	None
In case of such instrument, having different components, one has to present such components in financial statements either as equity or as liability based on the terms of the contract.	None
As a general principle, a contract that will be settled by an entity receiving a fixed number of its own shares is an equity instrument.	None
For example, when an enterprise issues shares in consideration of cash or some other asset service, the transaction does not result in any cash outflow.	None
For example, a redeemable preference share should be classified as liability and not as equity because it gives rise to an obligation to deliver cash.	None
This example is given to show that DTL is a liability because it results in cash outflow in future on account of timing differences.	None
A company has an option to designate a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss.	None
A financial asset held for trading should be classified as an asset at fair value through profit or loss.	None
The difference in the fair value of financial asset at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period is generally recognized as profit or loss in the PL a c. Similarly, loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost unless the company intends to sell the same immediately.	None
Similarly, there are certain assets like Heldtomaturityinvestments which are required to be carried in the balancesheet at the amortized cost.	None
In all such cases, the company will now have to classify such assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.	None
Therefore, fair value under the new A.S. has become the basis for measurement of financial assets.	None
Application of new standards will require a change in the mindset.	None
At present, nonfinancial companies carry current investments at cost or market value, whichever is lower.	None
However, they carry long term investments at cost.	None
They provide for permanent diminution in value of long term investment.	None
Similarly, in case the company pays customs duty under section 43B of Rs. 100.	None
For tax purpose, that company is entitled to deduction of Rs. 100/ in the year it makes payment.	None
But for accounting purpose, it can divide Rs. 100/ into Rs.	None
80/ Rs. 20/ (embedded in the closing stock).	None
The company can show Rs. 20/ as prepaid expense, in the balancesheet.	None
The above examples indicate that measurement and recognition of timing differences and financial instruments at fair value brings transparency in presentation of financial statements.	None
Lastly, valuation is an important element of the Method of Accounting.	None
In our view, para 9 of AS 22 merely represents gapfilling exercise, therefore, there is no merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the appellants that AS 22 is inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act including Schedule VI.	None
It proceeds on the principle that every transaction has a tax effect.	Reasoning
The words true and fair view in section 211(1) connotes the widest law making powers and, in that context, we hold that that impugned Rule adopting AS 22 is intra vires as the said Rule is incidental and or supplementary to the specific powers given to the Central Government to make Rules, particularly when such power is given to fillin details.	Reasoning
The word supplementary means something added to what is there in the Act, to fillin details for which the Act itself does not provide.	None
It is something in the sense that is required to implement what is there in the Act.	Reasoning
See Daymond v. South West Water Authority (1976) 1	Reasoning
All ER 39.	Reasoning
There is no merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the appellants that the impugned Rule seeks to modify the essential features of the Companies Act.	Reasoning
Rules made on matters permitted by the Act to supplement the Act cannot be held to be in violation of the Act.	Reasoning
See Britnell v. Secretary of State (supra).	Reasoning
When the power to make rules is limited to particular topics and if that rule falls within the ambit of that topic, namely, taxes on income in the present case, it cannot be said that the rule is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act.	Reasoning
As stated above, the Act and the Rules form part of the composite scheme.	Reasoning
The provisions of sections 205, 209 and 211 can be put into operation only if the Act and the Rules are read together.	Reasoning
In the present case, in our view, the impugned Rule constitutes a legitimate aid to construction of the provisions of the Companies Act.	Reasoning
Further, as stated above, the Central Government is the rule making authority under section 211(3C).	Reasoning
As rule making authority, the Central Government is empowered to enact accounting standards in consultation with NAC which may be at variance with the Standards issued by the Institute.	Reasoning
In the case of Union of India and anr.	None
v. Cynamide India Ltd. and anr.	None
reported in (1987) 2 SCC 720 one of the arguments advanced on behalf of the company was that, in calculating the net worth the cost of worksinprogress and the amount invested outside business were excluded from free reserves and that such exclusion could not be justified on any known principle of commercial accountancy (See para 33).	None
The matter related to price fixation.	None
In the Control Order vide para 2(g) the word free reserve was defined.	None
Similarly, in the Form prescribed in the Fourth Schedule, several items like bonus, bad debts and provisions, loss gain on sale of assets etc. were required to be excluded from the cost of production.	None
Therefore, it was argued that such exclusion was not warranted by principles of commercial accountancy.	None
This argument was rejected by this Court on the ground that it was open to the subordinate body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production.	None
That the said body was under no obligation to adopt the method indicated under the Income tax Act in allowing expenses for the purposes of ascertaining income.	None
It was further held that so long as the method prescribed and adopted by the subordinate legislating body is not opposite to the principle statutory provisions and so long as the method prescribed is ancillary to the provisions of the parent Act, it cannot be legitimately questioned.	None
In the present case, as stated above, measurement and recognition methods are not the items under the Companies Act.	Reasoning
Methods of recognition and measurements are talked about by the provisions of the Companies Act.	Reasoning
Recognition and measurement of various items of revenue expenses etc. stand covered only by the accounting standards.	Reasoning
Therefore, it cannot be said that the said standards are contrary to the provisions of the Companies Act.	Reasoning
We also do not find any merit in the argument advanced on behalf of the appellants that the impugned Rule does not touch upon maintenance of books of accounts to be kept by the company.	None
Under section 209(3)(b)	None
every company is required to keep its books of accounts on accrual basis and according to doubleentry system of accounting.	None
Under section 209(3)(a)	None
every company is required to maintain books of accounts necessary to provide a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and its accounts.	None
In our view, books of accounts do not include balancesheet and PL a c. However, as stated above, there is a difference between true and correct accrual and true and fair accrual.	None
In the past, what prevailed was true and correct accrual.	None
At that time, it was noticed in several cases that profits were overstated and, therefore, the Legislature inserted what is called as true and fair accrual concept.	None
The said concept is wider than the concept of true and correct accrual.	None
When section 209(3) refers to maintenance of books of accounts on accrual basis it means true and fair accrual, which would include not only matching principles but also fair valuation principles.	None
These principles do not contravene accrual system of accounting.	None
Moreover, we are concerned with presentation of balancesheet and PL a c.	None
These are financial statements.	None
An investor, shareholder or stakeholder is entitled to know the real income which the company has earned during the year.	None
Provision for diminution in value of an asset results in emergence of liability.	None
In the past, when timing difference concept was not there, in many cases, profits were overstated, particularly because provision for DTL (deferred taxation) was not recognized.	None
With the introduction of the timing difference concept, it cannot be said that the accrual system of accounting is violated.	None
As stated above, it is the concept of timing difference which obliterates the difference between accounting and tax incomes.	None
Ultimately, the object is to obliterate the difference between accounting income and taxable income.	None
Accounting income is the real income, therefore, in our view, para 9 of AS 22 is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act, including Schedule VI.	None
In the case of Bharat Hari Singhania and ors.	None
V. Commissioner of Wealthtax (Central) and ors.	None
reported in AIR 1994 SC 1355 valuation of unquoted equity shares based on the breakup method was challenged.	None
That challenge was rejected on the ground that the breakup method leads to appropriate market value and, therefore, the said method adopted by Rule 1D of Wealthtax Rules was neither ultra vires nor inconsistent with section 7 of the Wealth tax Act.	None
We quote herein below paras 13, 14 and 21 of the said judgment which held that it is always open to the rulemaking authority to prescribe an appropriate method of valuation out of several methods of valuing an asset.	None
And since the breakup method adopted by the rulemaking authority was a known method in the relevant circles, it cannot be said that the method adopted was an impermissible method.	None
Paras 13, 14 and 21 read as under We may first take up the question whether Rule 1D is void for being inconsistent with the Act or for the reason that it is beyond the rulemaking authority conferred by the Act.	None
Section 7(1) indeed defines the expression value of an asset.	None
It is the price which in the opinion of the Wealth Tax Officer it would fetch if sold in the open market on the valuation date, but this is made expressly subject to the Rule made in that behalf.	None
No. guidance is furnished by the Act to the rulemaking authority except to say that the Rule made must lead to ascertainment of the value of the asset (unquoted equity share) as defined in Section 7.	None
It is thus left to the rulemaking authority to prescribe an appropriate method for the purpose.	None
Now, there may be several method of valuing an asset or for that method an unquoted equity share.	None
The rulemaking authority cannot obviously prescribe all of them together.	None
It has to choose one of them which according to it is more appropriate.	None
The rulemaking authority has in this case chosen the breakup method, which is undoubtedly one of the recognised methods of valuing unquoted equity shares.	None
Even if it is assumed that there was another method available which was more appropriate, still the method chosen cannot be faulted so long as the method chosen is one of the recognised methods, though less popular.	None
One probable reason why yield method or dividend method was not adopted in the case of unquoted equity shares was that bulk of these companies are private limited companies where the divided declared does not represent the correct state of affairs and to estimate the probable yield is no simple exercise.	None
The dividends in these companies is declared to suit the purposes of the persons controlling the companies.	None
Maintainable profits rather than the dividends declared represent the correct index of the value of their shares.	None
The breakup method based upon the balancesheet of the company, incorporated in Rule 1D, is a fairly simple one.	None
Indeed, no serious objection can also be taken to this course since the basis of the Rule is the balancesheet of the company prepared by the company itself  subject, of course, to certain modifications provided in ExplanationII.14.	None
We are not satisfied that the breakup method adopted by Rule 1D does not lead to proper determination of the market value of the unquoted shares.	None
The argument to this effect, advanced by the learned Counsel for the assessees, is based upon the assumption premise that the value determined by applying the yield method is the correct market value.	None
We do not see any basis for this assumption.	None
No empirical data is placed before us in support of this submission or assumption.	None
It may be more advantageous to the assessees but that is not saying the same thing that it alone represents the true market value.	None
It cannot be stated as a principle that only the method that leads to lesser value is the correct method.	None
The idea is to find out the true market value and not the value more favourable to the assessee.	None
Accordingly, the contention that rule 1D is inconsistent with Section 7(1) or that it travels beyond that purview of Section 7 is rejected.xxx21.	None
The statement of law in the decision would thus establish that it does not purport to lay down any hard and fast rule.	None
It recognises that various factors in each case will have to be taken into account to determine the method of valuation to be applied in that case.	None
The dividend yield method is not the only method indicated in the case of a going concern there is the earning method and then a combination of both methods.	None
The several qualifications added to the above rules, as already stated, make them highly cumbersome and timeconsuming.	None
The Wealth Tax Officer has to examine the facts and circumstances of each case including the nature of the business, prospects of profitability and similar other considerations before finally determining whether to apply the dividend method, yield method or whether the breakup method should be followed.	None
There may be cases where an assessee may be holding shares of a large number of private companies or other public limited companies whose shares are not quoted.	None
Compared to them, the breakup method incorporated in Rule 1D is far simpler and far less timeconsuming.	None
It prescribes a simple uniform method to be followed in all cases.	None
All that the Wealth Tax Officer has to do is to take the balancesheet, delete some items from the columns relating to assets and liabilities as directed by ExplanationII, and then apply the formula contained in the Rule.	None
He need not have to look into the profitability, the earning capacity and the various other factors mentioned in propositions (2), (3) and (4) of the decision.	None
The decision, it bears repetition, recognises that breakup method nonetheless is one of the methods.	None
In the circumstances, it is difficult to agree with the learned Counsel for the assessees either that breakup method is not a recognised method or that yield method is the only permissible method for valuing the unquoted equity shares.	None
It is not as if the rulemaking authority has adopted a method unknown in the relevant circles or has devised an impermissible method.	None
There is no empirical data produced before us to show that breakup method does not lead to the determination of market value of the shares.	None
Merely because yield method may be more advantageous from the assessees point of view, it does not follow that it alone leads to the ascertainment of true market value and that all other methods are erroneous or misleading.	None
This aspect we have emphasised hereinbefore too.	None
Validity of Para 33 of AS 22	None
We have already quoted hereinabove para 33.	None
The said para is challenged on the ground that a subordinate legislation cannot be retrospective unless there is provision to that effect in the parent Act.	None
Therefore, the short question which we have to decide is whether the said para is retrospective.	None
To decide the said question, we have to analyse the scope of para 33.	None
For the purpose of determining accumulated deferred tax in the period in which the Standard is applied for the first time, the opening balances of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and for tax purposes are to be compared and the differences, if any, are to be determined.	None
The tax effect of these differences have got to be recognized as DTA or DTL, if such differences are timing differences.	None
For example, in the year in which a company adopts AS 22, the opening balance of a fixed asset is, lets say, Rs. 100 for accounting purposes and Rs. 60 for tax purposes.	None
This difference is because the company applied written down value method of depreciation for calculating taxable income, whereas for calculating accounting income it adopts straightline method.	None
This difference will reverse in future when depreciation for tax purposes will be allowed as compared to depreciation for accounting purposes.	None
In this example, lets assume that the tax rate is 40 per cent and that there are no other timing differences then, DTL would be Rs. 100 Rs. 60 x 40/100 Rs. 16	None
Once we are required to take into account the concept of opening balance of a fixed asset in para 33, it cannot be said that the said para is retrospective.	None
In fact, it is a transitional provision.	None
Lets say that there is an expenditure which is written off for accounting purposes in the year in which it is incurred but is admissible for deduction under Incometax Act over a period of time.	None
In such a case, the asset representing expenditure would have a Balance only for tax purposes and not for accounting purposes.	None
Therefore, the difference between the Balance of the asset for tax purposes and balance for accounting purposes, which is nil, would give rise to a timing difference which will reverse in future when expenditure would be allowed for tax purposes.	None
In such a case, DTA would be recognized in respect of difference, subject to the principle of prudence.	None
In the circumstances, it cannot be said that para 33 is retrospective.	None
Conclusion For the aforestated reasons, we are of the view that the impugned Notification Rule is neither ultra vires nor inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act, including Schedule VI.	None
To sum up, deferred tax is nothing but accrual of tax due to divergence between accounting profit and tax profit.	None
This difference arises on two counts, namely, different treatment of items of revenue expense as per profit and loss account and as per the tax law.	None
It also arises on account of the difference between the amount of revenue expense as per profit and loss account and the corresponding amount considered for tax purposes, e.g., depreciation.	None
However, we need to comment on one aspect.	None
Before the Calcutta High Court, the impugned Notification adopting AS 22 was also challenged on the ground that the provisions of AS 22 insofar as it relate to deferred taxation is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.	None
In this connection, it was pleaded that by making AS 22 mandatory, the appellants companies will suffer erosion of its net worth.	None
That, as a result, the debt equity ratio will also increase and that the lenders may recall the loans and thereby the appellants rights to carry on business in future would be violated.	None
Although, the aforestated challenge was pleaded in the writ petition, when the matter came for hearing before the High Court, it appears that the said grounds were not argued.	None
According to the appellants, implementation of AS 22 would result in reduction of profits and reserves.	None
In the circumstances, we do not wish to express any opinion on the constitutional validity of the said AS 22.	None
Whether the said Standard constitutes a restriction on the rights of the appellants to carry on business under Article 19(1)(g) or whether the said Standard is violative of Article 14 are questions on which we express no opinion.	None
We keep those questions open.	None
Suffice it to state that, in the present case, we are of the view that the said AS 22 is neither ultra vires nor inconsistent with the provisions of the Companies Act, including Schedule VI.	None
For the aforestated reasons, we find no infirmity in the impugned judgment of the High Court and, accordingly, the civil appeals filed by the various companies stand dismissed with no order as to costs.	None
