If the buyers have been informed, they have dealt with the plots at their own peril.	Arguments of Respondent
If they have not been informed, Ajar must make good the loss by returning the entire sale consideration together with interest and(viii)	Arguments of Respondent
From the documents produced before this Court by Ajar it emerges that nearly onefourth of the sale deeds were executed post September 2015 after the hearing in the writ petition had concluded.	Arguments of Respondent
Ajar has hence acted with a lack of bona fides only to defeat the final orders that would be passed in the public interest petition.	Arguments of Respondent
These submissions need to be considered.	Arguments of Respondent

Every lease has to be either for thirty years or ninety nine years as determined by the authority with a right of renewal by the lessor.	None
Rule 24 indicates that it is subject to the provisions contained in the Rules.	None
Moreover, while Rule 24 does contemplate a provision for renewal, the expression right of renewal by the lessor is of significance.	None
The provision does not embody an absolute or indefeasible right of renewal.	None
Undoubtedly, a development authority as a public body cannot act arbitrarily or at its own whims, in deciding whether or not to renew the lease.	None
Its decisions must be guided by public interest.	None
Public interest postulates both protecting the interests of the authority and ensuring fairness to the leaseholder who may have constructed on the land in pursuance of the leasehold.	None
Neither Rule 24 nor Rule 25 can be read to divest the authority of the element of discretion on whether to renew the lease.	None

Now it is in this background that it would be necessary to appreciate the facts pertaining to the acquisition of the land and its allotment to IISCO under the original lease agreement dated 16 July 1985.	None
UDA intended to prepare a town development scheme for the development of residential colonies, commercial centres, public offices and public amenities  among other things  for which an area bound by (i) Ujjain Dewas Road (ii) Ujjain Sanwer Road and (iii) Government Engineering College Road was proposed.	None
A declaration was issued under Section 50(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam, 1973 on 18 August 1977 which was gazetted on 23 September 1977.	None
On 20 January 1978, a notice was issued under Section 50(3) inviting objections and suggestions to the draft development scheme.	None
On 17 June 1978, a notification was issued under Section 50(7) specifying the lands included in the scheme.	None
The notification was published in the Gazette on 11 August 1978.	None
Subsequently, a notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 was issued on 20 January 1979 which was published in the Gazette on 16 February 1979.	None
Under the notification 275 hectares of land were proposed to be acquired.	None
A declaration under Section 6 was issued on 20 March 1979 which was gazetted on 13 April 1979.	None
A total area admeasuring 275 hectares was acquired in four phases.	None
In the first phase, 150.856 hectares of land were acquired against a compensation of Rs. 61.35 lacs at an average rate of acquisition of Rs. 4.06 per square meter.	None
The subject land, it has been stated, was taken possession of on 19 May 1979 and 26 May 1979.	None
The land owners had claimed compensation of Rs. 7000 per bigha (Rs 3.34 per square meter) for some part and Rs. 6000 per bigha (Rs 2.87 per square meter) for the remaining land.	None
These rates were agreed upon and compensation was paid in 1979.	None
The premium for the grant of leasehold interests to IISCO was fixed at Rs. 10 per square metre, excluding development charges.	None
UDA claims on this basis that the premium to IISCO was charged at a market rate.	None
What is, however of significance is that UDA has not disclosed before this Court the rate at which other adjoining lands were transferred.	None
The original lease deed dated 16 July 1985 was executed in favour of IISCO specifically for the purpose of the constructing residential houses and for the development of a colony.	None
The total extent of the land leased was 43,407 square meters.	None
The premium was Rs. 4,34,070 with an annual lease rent of Rs. 8681 computed at two percent of the premium.	None
Under the terms of the lease, there was a prohibition on the transfer of the land unless the lessee, which had been granted the land to develop a colony and construct residential houses had done so.	Facts
In the event that the lessee wished to transfer the land due to special circumstances, UDA could consider such a request subject to the payment of stipulated transfer fees.	None
The original lease agreement contemplated that the term of the lease could be renewed for two further periods, each of thirty years, with an enhancement of the lease rent at the time of every renewal.	Facts
We have duly considered both English translation of the clause for renewal as set out in the lease deed annexed to these proceedings as well as the original in Hindi which read as follows The above land is being given on lease for first 30 years for construction of residential houses on lease.	None
The lease period is ineffective from 21.12.82.	None
Thereafter the term of lease can be extended (renewed) for two further periods of 3030 years.	None
At the time of every extension the lease rent can be increased by 50 .	Facts
HINDI MATTER	None
A close reading of the clause for renewal would make it abundantly clear that there was no absolute or indefeasible right of renewal.	Reasoning
The language contained in the clause for renewal indicates that parties contemplated that the term of the lease could on its expiry on 20 December 1982 be renewed for two further terms each of thirty years.	Reasoning
As discussed above, Rule 24 of the 1977 Rules indicates that subject to the provisions of the Rules, every transfer would be by way of lease the lease would be either for thirty years or ninety nine years as determined by the authority which would be renewal by the lessor.	Reasoning
Rule 25 posited, in the case of a lease for a term of thirty years, that there would be a right of renewal for two further periods each of thirty years subject to the payment of enhanced ground rent not exceeding fifty percent.	Reasoning
A large tract of land admeasuring 43,407 square metres was granted on lease to it with a specific purpose of constructing residential houses and for developing a colony.	Reasoning
If land is proposed to be granted by direct negotiations as stipulated in Rule 5(a)	Reasoning
the modalities are prescribed in Rule 6 of the 1975 Rules.	Reasoning
These modalities include (i) fixation of the premium in accordance with the general or special sanction of the state government to the scale of premium (ii) due publicity of the proposal to dispose of land by the authority by negotiations, in at least two newspapers one of which should be a local Hindi newspaper and in another newspaper that has wide circulation in the state together with the publication of notices in prominent public offices (iii) submission of offers together with earnest money deposit not less than onefifth of the premium and (iv) procedure to be followed where more than one offer is received.	Reasoning
UDA has in its additional affidavit dated 14 August 2017 filed in these proceedings adverted to the manner in which the first phase of land admeasuring 150.856 hectares was acquired against the payment of compensation and the allotment of land on lease to IISCO.	Reasoning
UDA has produced no material to indicate that it had followed the procedure laid down in Rule 6 of the 1975 Rules when it proceeded to make the original allotment in favour of IISCO.	Reasoning
While UDA claims that the land was allotted to IISCO at Rs. 10 per square metre excluding development charges without any concession, it has remained silent on the rates at which other adjoining land was allotted to parties other than IISCO.	Reasoning
There is intrinsic merit in the submission which has been urged by Ms Kamini Jaiswal, learned counsel for the first and second respondents that the allotment in the present case was not referable to Rule 5(a) which speaks of a transfer of land by direct negotiations.	Reasoning
Since the allotment to IISCO was neither by way of public auction under Rule 5(b) nor by inviting tenders under Rule 5(c) the allotment would only be referable to Rule 5(d) which is an allotment on concessional terms.	Reasoning
The power to grant land on concessional terms is subject to Rule 19 under which a grant is contemplated to a public institution or body registered under any law for the time being in force.	Reasoning
Ordinarily, as Rule 20 prescribes, such a grant can be made only for charitable purposes.	Reasoning
The expression ordinarily indicates a general though not an invariable or mandatory requirement.	Reasoning
This aspect of the matter, in our view, is of importance since the purpose for which the land which was granted to a subsidiary of a public sector undertaking was the development of a residential colony, evidently for the benefit of the employees of IISCO.	None
When IISCO went into liquidation, its assets and properties including the leasehold interest, were put up for sale under the auspices of the Official Liquidator.	Reasoning
When the Official Liquidator issued a notice on 9 May 2003, UDA informed him on 6 June 2003 that it was cancelling the allotment of the land for violation of the terms of the lease both on account of a default in the payment of the lease rent and because of a violation of the lease condition mandating construction on the land.	Facts
The Official Liquidator was informed of the reentry by UDA.	None
After the Calcutta High Court had accepted the highest bid for the sale of the assets of the company in liquidation, UDA raised an objection before the High Court by filing an application.	None
The learned Company Judge in his judgment dated 5 August 2005 clearly indicated that what was sold was the leasehold interest in the unexpired portion of the lease which was to still run for a period of seven years.	Facts
While noting that the deed of lease contains a clause for renewal, the Calcutta High Court carefully noted that for such renewal clause the parties would have to agree to the modalities.	None
The Official Liquidator was held to have assigned the interest of the company liquidation in the leasehold land.	None
The Calcutta High Court noted that if UDA did not agree to the terms and conditions for renewal after the expiration of seven years, the lease would not be renewed and UDA would automatically get possession back.	None
It was in this view of the matter that the High Court did not enquire into the question as to whether there was any breach by the company in liquidation of its obligations under the original lease deed.	None
The judgment of the Single Judge was confirmed in appeal by the Division Bench and eventually a special leave petition was dismissed by this Court as well.	None
When UDA decided to renew the lease it proceeded on the basis that after the decision of the Calcutta High Court, it had no option but to renew the lease.	Reasoning
Even before this Court, the submission of UDA is that once its objections were overruled by the Calcutta High Court it had no option but to renew the lease.	Reasoning
This submission betrays a lack of understating of the judgment of the Calcutta High Court as well as of the terms of the original lease.	Reasoning
The judgment of the Calcutta High Court made it abundantly clear both to the assignee who had successfully bid for the leasehold interest as well as to UDA that what was being transferred was the interest of the company liquidation under the lease deed dated 16 July 1985.	Reasoning
Undoubtedly, this comprised besides the residue of the unexpired term of seven years, the benefit of the original lease agreement which contains a renewal clause.	Reasoning
However, both on the interpretation of that clause by the Calcutta High Court as well as on the plain terms of the clause, it is evident that there was no indefeasible right of renewal.	Reasoning
The clause for renewal provided that the lease could be renewed, not that it must or shall be renewed.	Reasoning
Moreover, Rules 24 and 25 of the 1977 Rules cannot be read to preclude UDA, as the lessor, from having due regard to all relevant circumstances bearing upon the public interest while deciding whether to renew the lease.	Reasoning
Several aspects bearing upon the public interest were required to be borne in mind.	Reasoning
These included firstly, the fact that the purpose for which the land was originally granted to IISCO namely the construction of a residential colony for the employees of IISCO could not be achieved by Ajar secondly, whether the breach of the covenants contained in the lease agreement would disentitle the grant of renewal thirdly, the fact that the assignment of the land was to a private developer who was evidently intending to use it not for the original purpose for which the land was allotted to IISCO but for commercial development fourthly, the value of the land on the date when the renewal was sought and fifthly that public interest would best be subserved by ensuring that UDA realised the best possible price for the land after following an open and transparent process.	Reasoning
We must note at this stage that the present case does not fall into the category of that class of cases where a person or entity to whom the land is allotted in the first place has fulfilled the purpose of the allotment and seeks a renewal of the grant.	Reasoning
For instance, where a person to whom the land has been allotted for residential construction completes the construction and, upon the expiry of the term of the lease seeks a renewal of the lease, a distinct set of considerations will apply.	Reasoning
Such an individual or a cooperative society of flat purchasers may legitimately contend that having due regard to the provisions contained in the lease document and in Rules 24 and 25, it would be manifestly unfair to reauction the land at the time of renewal.	Reasoning
The present case does not fall in such a category simply because the purpose for which the land was allotted to the company in liquidation was not the purpose for which Ajar had stepped in.	Reasoning
Ajar could not be oblivious to the observations contained in the judgment of the Calcutta High Court particularly when the clause for renewal in the original lease deed did not stipulate an absolute or indefeasible right of renewal.	Reasoning
In taking the view that UDA had no option but to renew the lease, UDA has acted in a manner which betrays a total lack of understanding of its rights and of the trust placed in it as a custodian of public interest.	Reasoning
UDA has acted in a manner that has ensured the conferment of a largesse upon the private developer in disregard of the public interest in ensuring the disposal of lands belonging to the authority in a transparent manner which ensures the realization of the best possible return.	Reasoning
The renewal of the lease dated 10 May 2012 for a further term of thirty years from 20 December 2012 to 21 December 2042 was manifestly flawed.	None
The conversion of the land to freehold in favour of Ajar has evidently followed upon the renewal of the lease deed in favour of Ajar on 10 May 2012.	None
Rule 5 of the 2010 Rules for the grant of freehold rights provides as follows Class of land eligible for conversion  Any land situated in an urban area and which is, 1.	None
Granted on leasehold basis for a period of thirty years or more by the State Government or by an Officer authorised to do so for residential or commercial purpose or2.	None
given on leasehold right of thirty years or more for residential or commercial purpose, by virtue of a lease executed in favour of any person by the Madhya Pradesh Housing Board or a Development Authority or a Housing Cooperative Society on producing of a noobjection certificate from such Board or Authority or Society, as the case may be, shall be eligible for conversion Provided that such land as has been allotted without charging full premium as prescribed under the Revenue Book Circular shall not be eligible for conversion Provided further that land allotted to an urban local body shall note be eligible for conversion Provided also that no such leasehold land shall be converted whose lease conditions specifically prohibit conversion or on which leasehold rights have accrued under the Madhya Pradesh Nagariya Kshetro Ke Bhoomihin Vyakti (Pattadhruti Adhikaron Ka Pradan Kiya Jana)	None
Adhiniyam, 1984 (No. 15 of 1984) or Rajiv Gandhi Patta Aashtya Yojana or Mukhyamantri Aashrya Yojana.	None
Both Clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 5 stipulate that, to be eligible for conversion to freehold, the land in an urban area should have been granted on a leasehold basis for a period of thirty years or more.	Reasoning
In the present case, the conversion to freehold on 12 July 2013 has its foundation in the lease deed dated 10 May 2012 under which the term of the lease was renewed for a period of thirty years from 21 December 2012 to 20 December 2042.	Reasoning
But for the renewal, the term of the original lease expired on 20 December 2012.	Reasoning
Once the renewal which was granted in favour of Ajar is seriously flawed and invalid, the conversion of the land to freehold would in consequence also be unsustainable.44.	Reasoning
The third party purchasers were not parties to the proceedings before the High Court.	Reasoning
However, we have heard them in the present proceedings both on the merits of the decision of the High Court as well as on the equities which they assert in their favour.	Reasoning
In so far as the validity of the renewal is concerned that is something which concerns Ajar, through whom the purchasers assert their claim.	Reasoning
However, leaving aside technicalities, we have heard them on all aspects.45.	Reasoning
The judgment of the High Court has been assailed on the ground that the proceedings were concluded without furnishing third party purchasers an opportunity of being heard.	Reasoning
The submission that there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice has been urged by both Ajar as well as on behalf of the purchasers.	Reasoning
The interests of the purchasers have been pursued both in a special leave petition and in the interim application.	Reasoning
The purchasers of plots claim their interest through the developer.	Reasoning
It is necessary to note in this context that the public interest litigation before the High Court was instituted on 2 July 2013.	None
By that date, the developer had on 10 May 2012 obtained a renewal of the lease for a period of thirty years and had applied for conversion of the land into freehold.	None
UDA executed a deed for the conversion of the leasehold land to freehold on 12 July 2013.	Facts
It is thereafter on 19 September 2013 that Ajar claims to have obtained approvals for construction and development on the property.	Facts
Even according to Ajar, the third party transactions were entered into by it during the pendency of the writ proceedings before the High Court.	None
The developer was aware of the pendency of the proceedings before the High Court and it is in this background that the claim of his having created third party rights needs to be evaluated.	None
Ajar tendered during the course of these proceedings, a summary containing the third party rights stated to have been created on the land in dispute.	None
According to the statement, the total land available for sale is 24,688.06 square meters and the remaining area has to be developed for roads, open spaces, gardens and services.	None
The saleable area has been carved up into 178 plots.	None
The position which Ajar claims is as follows out of the 178 plots third party rights have been created in respect of 124 plots while 54 plots remain unsold sale deeds have been executed in respect of 67 plots agreements to sell have been executed in respect of 20 plots and allotments have been made in respect 37 plots.	None
The disclosures which have been made in the statement tendered on behalf of the developer indicate that the agreements to sell as well as the sale deeds were executed during the pendency of the writ proceedings before the High Court.	Reasoning
Except for eight sale deeds, the others have been executed after Ajar was served with notice of the writ proceedings on 15 September 2014.	Reasoning
Ms Jaiswal urged before the court that from the statement produced by the developer on the record it emerges that even after the High Court reserved judgment, the developer continued to execute agreements to sell and sale deeds before the final judgment came to be delivered.	Reasoning
This submission is borne out from the statement which has been placed on the record by the developer.	Reasoning
The developer executed agreements to sell in 2014, 2015 and even as late as January 2016 shortly before the High Court delivered its decision on 8 February 2016.	Reasoning
Sixty seven sale deeds, of which details have been furnished on the record, indicate execution of the document of sale in 2014, 2015 and 2016.	Reasoning
The summary indicates that of the sale deeds, as many as 21 were executed between November 2015 and February 2016 after judgment has been reserved and before it was delivered by the High Court.	Reasoning
There is an evident lack of bona fides on the part of Ajar.	Reasoning
A Constitution Bench of this Court has held in its decision in re Natural Resources (supra) that auction is not the only permissible means for the disposal of natural resources.	None
The court noticed that legislation does permit or prescribe methods other than auction, Justice D K Jain delivering the judgment of four judges held that 149auction as a mode cannot be conferred the status of a constitutional principle.	None
Alienation of natural resources is a policy decision, and the means adopted for the same are thus, executive prerogatives.	None
However, when such a policy decision is not backed by a social or welfare purpose, and precious and scarce natural resources are alienated for commercial pursuits of profit maximizing private entrepreneurs, adoption of means other than those that are competitive and maximize revenue may be arbitrary and face the wrath of Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
Hence, rather than prescribing or proscribing a method, we believe, a judicial scrutiny of methods of disposal of natural resources should depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, in consonance with the principles which we have culled out above.	None
Failing which, the Court, in exercise of power of judicial review, shall term the executive action as arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable and capricious due to its antimony with Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar (as the learned Chief Justice then was) in his concurring judgment held that I would therefore conclude by stating that no part of the natural resource can be dissipated as a matter of largess, charity, donation or endowment, for private exploitation.	None
Each bit of natural resource expended must bring back a reciprocal consideration.	None
The consideration may be in the nature of earning revenue or may be to best subserve the common good.	None
It may well be the amalgam of the two.	None
There cannot be a dissipation of material resources free of cost or at a consideration lower than their actual worth.	None
One set of citizens cannot prosper at the cost of another set of citizens, for that would not be fair or reasonable.	None
Undoubtedly, disposal of natural resources by auction is not a mandatory principle for, as the Constitution Bench held, individual statutes may provide for modalities of transfer by alternate modes which subserve public interest.	None
In the present case, as we have noted, Rule 5 of the 1975 Rules provides four modalities (i) direct negotiations (ii) auction (iii) inviting tenders and (iv) concessional terms.	None
Where the statute has provided for several modes of disposal, the choice among one of the available methods must facilitate the fulfilment of public interest.	None
That inter alia requires consideration being given to all aspects of the matter including the nature and value of the land, the purpose of the allotment and the need for the authority to generate funds to facilitate the objects for which it was constituted, such as planned development.	None
The choice of one of a range of permissible choices can never be based on the anvil of conferring an undeserved benefit on a commercial developer.	None
The choice of methods is not left to the unbridled discretion of a public authority.	None
Where a public authority exercises an executive prerogative, it must nonetheless act in a manner which would subserve public interest and facilitate the distribution of scarce natural resources in a manner that would achieve public good.	None
Where a public authority implements a policy, which is backed by a constitutionally recognised social purpose intended to achieve the welfare of the community, the considerations which would govern would be different from those when it alienates natural resources for commercial exploitation.	None
When a public body is actuated by a constitutional purpose embodied in the Directive Principles, the considerations which weigh with it in determining the mode of alienation should be such as would achieve the underlying object.	None
In certain cases, the dominant consideration is not to maximize revenues but to achieve social good such as when the alienation is to provide affordable housing to members of the Scheduled Castes or Tribes or to implement housing schemes for Below the Poverty Line (BPL) families.	None
In other cases where natural resources are alienated for commercial exploitation, a public authority cannot allow them to be dissipated at its unbridled discretion at the cost of public interest.	None
The present case is indeed an illustration of a situation where a public body has acted oblivious to and in disregard of public interest.	Reasoning
The land was originally leased out to IISCO, a subsidiary of SAIL (an undertaking of the Government of India).	Reasoning
The purpose for allotting such a large tract of land admeasuring 43,407 square meters was to enable IISCO to construct and develop a residential colony for its employees.	Reasoning
The land was not being allotted for commercial exploitation to a developer.	Reasoning
The terms of the lease clearly evince the manner in which the land was to be utilized and the consequences of breach.	Reasoning
When IISCO went into liquidation, the Official Liquidator placed its assets including the leasehold land for sale.	Reasoning
Ajar under the deed of assignment acquired the leasehold rights for the remaining term of the lease on 1 September 2005 together with the rights and benefits arising out of the original lease of 16 July 1985.	Reasoning
The Calcutta High Court had clearly and expressly observed, while rejecting UDAs claim of forfeiture and reentry, that the transfer was of the residual term of seven years and that if UDA did not intend to renew the lease, the land would revert to it.	Reasoning
There was no absolute or indefeasible right to renewal either in IISCO or in Ajar, which succeeded to the leasehold interest.	Reasoning
As a matter of fact, when UDA decided to renew the lease, it was duty bound to evaluate all aspects bearing upon the public interest which included (i) the purpose for which the land was granted under the original lease agreement (ii) the extent to which the purpose had been fulfilled (iii) whether the original purpose underlying the grant of the land would be subserved by the renewal sought by a commercial developer (iv) the market value of the land (v) the revenue which would be generated for the activities of UDA if the land would be transferred on commercial terms that would realise the best price.	Reasoning
UDA choose to blink at its obligations by conferring a largesse on Ajar.	Reasoning
It did so on the hypothesis that after the Calcutta High Court had rejected its objections to the assignment of the leasehold interest, it was precluded from doing anything other than to renew the lease.	Reasoning
Clearly this was a misreading of the judgment of the Calcutta High Court.	Reasoning
The issue as to whether the lease should be renewed was a matter distinct from whether the original assignment of the lease in favour of IISCO to Ajar was valid.	Reasoning
The mere acquisition by Ajar of the leasehold interest for the remainder of the term together with the benefits of the original lease covenants, did not ipso jure entitle Ajar to renewal of the lease.	Reasoning
UDA was complicit in renewing the lease and granting an undeserved windfall on a commercial developer.	Reasoning
Fraud, it is wellsettled unravels everything.	Reasoning
The subsequent conversion of the land to freehold in September 2013 cannot enure to the benefit of Ajar since the underlying basis of the entire transaction stands vitiated by fraud.	Reasoning
There can be no manner of doubt about the principle which accepts the sanctity of contracts.	Reasoning
Equally, no court can be a hapless spectator when a public authority forsakes the trust with which valuable resources such as land under its control are impressed.	Reasoning
Land is a scarce public resource.	Reasoning
When public bodies are vested with control over land  in this case over land which was acquired for facilitating planned development, no authority can claim an immunity from its accountability to matters of public interest.51.	Reasoning
We will not interfere with the direction of the High Court to the effect that the transfer charges for the deed of assignment of lease shall be determined on the basis of the guidelines prevailing in 20112012.	Reasoning
The relevant date would have to be 7 June 2011 on which the deed of assignment was executed by UDA.52.	None
For the above reasons, we find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court.	Reasoning
However, we must, in the exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution suitably mould the relief so as to ensure the protection of persons with whom the developer has entered into registered sale deeds prior to the judgment of the High Court.	Reasoning
We have done so after finding some weight in the equities asserted on behalf of this class of purchasers who have registered sale deeds in their favour against the payment of full consideration.	Reasoning
We have been informed that they have taken loans from public financial institutions and have invested hardearned earnings towards the plots which they have purchased.	Reasoning
In the exercise of the power under Article 142 of the Constitution, the court has the duty to render complete justice.	Reasoning
In consequence we confirm all the directions issued by the High Court subject to the following rights which have been created in favour of third party purchasers of plots through the execution of registered sale deeds prior to the date of the judgment of the High Court shall not be disturbed(ii) UDA shall through its Chief Officer verify the correctness of the statement submitted by Ajar that it has executed sixty seven registered sale deeds in respect of individual plots prior to the judgment of the High Court.	Decision
This shall be completed within one month with notice to the individual purchasers and Ajar.	Decision
The benefit of direction (i) above shall only extend to those cases found to be genuine on verification and(iii) in respect of third parties (other than i above) with whom there are no registered sale deeds, Ajar shall refund the consideration paid by the respective purchasers within a period of three months together with interest at the rate of nine percent computed from the date on which payments were received.	Decision
The judgment of the High Court is affirmed in the above terms, and the appeals are disposed of.	Decision
