The petitioners are members of a religious denomination and constitute a religious minority.	None
The Society of which they are members maintains educational institutions primarily for the benefit of the Christian community, but admission is not denied to students professing other faiths.	None
They maintain a college for training women teachers required for their primary schools.	None
The petitioners claim that their fundamental rights guaranteed by Arts.	Arguments of Petitioner
30(1), 26 (a), (b) (c) and (d) and 19 (1) (f) and (g) are violated by letters dated May 28, 1955.	Arguments of Petitioner
December 27, 1955 and March 29, 1956 threatening to withhold the grantinaid and to withdraw recognition of the College.6.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is common ground that the Government of Bombay makes under the Education Code a grant of Rs. 8,000/ annually to the college.	None
This Code is not framed under any Statute but consists of a series of administrative directions issued by the Government of Bombay pertaining to matters educational and sets out regulations for making grants.	None
The Government also holds examinations for granting certificates to successful candidates as trained primary teachers and scholars receiving training in recognised institutions alone are entitled to appear at the examination.	None
Manifestly, in the absence of recognition by the Government, training in the College will have little practical utility.	None
The college is a nonprofit making institution and depends primarily upon donations and Government grant for meeting its expenses.	None
Without such grant it would be extremely difficult if not impossible for the institution to function.	None
7. Article 19(1) (f) on which reliance has been placed on behalf of the society does not come to its aid.	Reasoning
By that clause all citizens are declared to have the fundamental freedom to acquire, hold and dispose of property.	Reasoning
But by the rules and orders impugned no right to acquire, hold or dispose of property is violated.	Reasoning
Interference with the right of bare management of an educational institution does not amount to infringement of the right to property under Art.	Reasoning
19(1) (f).	Reasoning
The decision of this Court in Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, 1954 SCR 1005 (AIR 1954 SC 282 ) on which reliance is placed by the society does not lay down any proposition to the contrary.	Reasoning
The Court was dealing in that case with the alleged infringement of the right of a Mahant in a religious institution by the enactment of the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, XIX of 1951.	Reasoning
It was observed that a Mathadhipati of a Math is not a mere manager and that it would not be right to describe mahantship as a mere office a superior of a Math has not only duties to discharge.	Reasoning
In connection with the endowment but he has a personal interest of a beneficial character which is sanctioned by custom and is much larger than that of a Shebait in the debutter property x	None
x x x x x Thus in the conception of Mahantship as in Shebaitship, both the elements of office and property, of duties and personal interest are blended together and neither can be detached from the other.	None
The personal or beneficial interest of the Mahant in the endowments attached to an institution is manifested in his larger power to create derivative tenures in respect to endowed properties and these and other rights of a similar character invest the office of the Mahant with the character of proprietary right which, though anomalous to some extent, is still a genuine legal rights.	None
The word property in Art. 19(1) (f) must doubtless be extended to all those recognised types of interest which have the insignia or characteristics of proprietary rights, and a Mathadhipati has those rights, but it cannot be said that the petitioners in this case have any such proprietary rights as are vested in the Mahant of a Math Nor does the principle of Sri Dwarka Nath Tewari v. State of Bihar, AIR 1959 SC 249 apply to this case.	Reasoning
In Dwarka Naths case AIR 1959 SC 249 by an executive order the Government of Bihar purported to divest the trustees of a school of their right to land and building belonging to the school.	Reasoning
The Court held that the applicants in whom the land and the building of the school were vested as the Managing Committee of the school could not be divested of their rights by the mere fist of an official of the Government.	Reasoning
No attempt is made by the order of the State to deprive the petitioners of their right to property, and fundamental freedom guaranteed by Art. 19(1) (f) of the Constitution is therefore not violated.	Reasoning
Nor is the right of the petitioners to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed under Art. 19(1) (g) of the Constitution infringed by the impugned rules and directions.	Reasoning
8.	None
Article 26 occurs in a group dealing with freedom of religion and is intended to protect the right to manage religious affairs.	Reasoning
By clause (a) of Art.	Reasoning
26.	Reasoning
every religious denomination or any section thereof, has subject to public order, morality and health, the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, and in a larger sense an educational institution may be regarded as charitable.	Reasoning
But in the view we take of the protection of Art.	Reasoning
30(1)	Reasoning
, we do not think it necessary to express any opinion on the plea that the right of the petitioners granted by Art.	Reasoning
26 to manage the college is infringed by the impugned rules and orders issued by the Government of Bombay.	Reasoning
9.	None
Serious inroads are made by the Rules and Orders issued by the Government of Bombay upon the right vested in the society to administer the training College.	None
By R. 5 (2) of the Rules for Primary Training Colleges, the Government is authorised to reserve in nonGovernment institutions a percentage of seats for the Board deputed teachers and the Management of the institution has the right to admit students only for unreserved seats.	None
By R. 11 of the Rules for recognition of the Private Primary Institutions, authority is again assumed by the Government to reserve seats for Board deputed teachers.	None
By R.14, the Education Department is authorised to withdraw recognition and to refuse to pay grant to any private institution for nonfulfilment of the conditions set out in the Rules for inefficient management and poor quality of teaching or failure to comply with the regulations in force or that may be issued from time to time by the Government or by the Director of Education on behalf of Government.	None
It is manifest that the right of the Private Training Colleges to admit students of their own choice is severely restricted and enforcement of the restrictions is sought to be secured by holding out a threat to withdraw recognition and to refuse to pay grant.	None
10.	None
Article 30(1) provides that all minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice, and Art.	None
30(2) enjoins the State, in granting aid to educational institutions not to discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language.	None
Clause (2) is only a phase of the nondiscrimination clause of the Constitution and does not derogate from the provisions made in clause (1).	None
The clause is moulded in terms negative the State is thereby enjoined not to discriminate in granting aid to educational institutions on the ground that the management of the institution is in the hands of a minority, religious or linguistic, but the form is not susceptible of the inference that the State competent otherwise to discriminate so as to impose restrictions upon the substance of the right to establish and administer educational institutions by minorities, religious or linguistic.	None
Unlike Art. 19, the fundamental freedom under clause (1) of Art. 30, is absolute in terms it is not made subject to any reasonable restrictions of the nature the fundamental freedoms enunciated in Art. 19 may be subjected to.	None
All minorities, linguistic or religious have by Art.	None
30(1)	Reasoning
an absolute right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice and any law or executive direction which seeks to infringe the substance of that right under Art.	None
30(1) would to that extent be void.	None
This, however, is not to say that it is not open to the State to impose regulations upon the exercise of this right.	None
The fundamental freedom is to establish and to administer educational institutions it is a right to establish and administer what are in truth educational institutions  institutions which cater to the educational needs of the citizens, or sections thereof.	None
Regulation made in the true interests of efficiency of instruction discipline, health, sanitation, morality, public order and the like may undoubtedly be imposed.	None
Such regulations are not restrictions on the substances of the right which is guaranteed they secure the proper functioning of the institutions, in matters educational.	None
11.	None
The petitioners do not contend that the absolute terms in which the Art. 30(1) is enunciated deprive the State, especially when it pays grant and affords recognition to it as an educational institution competent to train students for the examinations held by the State, to impose reasonable regulations.	Arguments of Petitioner
But, it is contended that these regulations can only be in the interest of the institution regulations to make it an effective educational institution so as to secure excellence of the training imparted therein the regulations cannot be made in the interest of outsiders.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel for the State of Gujarat (upon which State the duty to defend this petition has since the constitution of the new State of Gujarat, devolved) contended that the right extends to all such regulations as may appear to the Government in the national or public interest, provided that the regulations do not tend to destroy the character of the institution as one maintained by the minority.	Arguments of Respondent
Counsel submits that the State is not bound to make a grant, nor it is bound to recognise the minority institution for examinations held by the State if the State makes a grant or gives recognition to an institution for the examination held by it, the State is entitled to impose conditions relating to admission of students and to withhold grant and recognition, in the event of the institution failing to carry out the conditions such regulation being in the national or public interest.	Arguments of Respondent
Counsel concedes that if the effect of the restrictions is the total destruction of the character of the institution as an institution administered by a minority, the restrictions may be regarded as infringing Art.	Arguments of Respondent
30(1) but not otherwise.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of his argument, reliance is placed upon the affidavit of Dr. D.V. Chickermane who affirmed that the number of Primary and Basic Schools in the State run by District School or Municipal Boards and others was great, primary schools alone being over 8,900 and the untrained personnel in all the primary schools was about 40,000 which had to be progressively reduced in the interest of the public.	Arguments of Respondent
It was therefore necessary for the Government and the private Colleges receiving grantinaid from Government to prepare qualified teachers for these schools in large numbers and if the private Training Colleges did not train teachers for the School Boards, it would not be possible for such colleges to absorb all the teachers trained by them in their own schools and the training given to extra teachers would be wasted.	Arguments of Respondent
Dr. Chickermane further affirmed that in 1955 the Government had decided to step up the programme of training teachers in the Boards Schools for training 2,000 teachers every year, the intention being to remove the untrained element in primary schools in the State as early as possible, and that with this object the Government had decided to depute 1,600 teachers to private Training Colleges and this could be possible only if 80 seats in the private Training Colleges would be reserved for such nominees.	Arguments of Respondent
12.	None
The truth of these statements made in Dr. Chickermanes affidavit is not deemed by the petitioners.	Arguments of Petitioner
They however submit that the requirement of the State Government of a large number of trained teachers in the near future is not a ground on which the infringement of the fundamental right of the society under Art.	Arguments of Petitioner
30(1) to administer its educational institution could be justified.	Arguments of Petitioner
13.	None
Restrictions imposed by the Rules and the directions issued upon the right of the society to administer Training College maintained by it, are manifestly not conceived in the interests of the College.	None
The Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the State contends that this Court has held in the Kerala Education Bill 1957.	None
In re, 1959 SCR 995 (AIR 1958 SC 956 ), that the State may validly impose restrictive measures in the national or the public interest on the right of a minority to administer its educational institution notwithstanding the protection of Art. 30(1), provided such measures are not annihilative of the character of the minority educational institutions.	Arguments of Respondent
The Kerala Education Bill case, 1959 SCR 995 (AIR 1958 SC 956 ) arose out of a reference made by the President under Art.	None
143 of the Constitution, and this Court was called upon to report amongst others on the question whether subcl.	None
5 of cl.3.	None
subcl.	None
(3) of cl.8 and Cls.9 to 13 of the Bill or any provisions thereof, offended cl.	None
(1) of Art.	None
30 of the Constitution.	None
By the impugned clauses of the Bill establishment of a new school or the opening of a higher class in any private school could be made only in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder, and any school or higher class established or opened otherwise than in accordance with such provisions was not to be entitled to recognition by the Government (Cl.3 (5))	None
all fees collected from the students in an aided school were notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement, scheme or arrangement to be made over to the Government (Cl.8(3)) and the salary of the teachers in aided school was to be paid by the Government (Cl.9) the Government was authorised to prescribe qualifications of teachers in private schools and the Public Service Commission was authorised to frame a list of teachers for appointment in aided schools (Cls. 10 and 11) the conditions of service relating to scales of pay, pension, provident fund, insurance and age of retirement applicable to teachers of Government schools were to apply to teachers of aided schools, and the Managers of aided schools were without the previous Sanction of the Government prohibited from dismissing removing or reducing in rank or suspending any teachers, and subject to the provisions so enacted the conditions of service of teachers of aided schools were to be such as may be prescribed (C1.12) the Government was authorised to take over any aided school if it appeared that the management thereof had neglected to perform the duties imposed by or under the Act or the rules made thereunder, or if the Government was satisfied, that was necessary to do so for standardising general education in the State or for improving the level of literacy in any area or for more effectively managing the aided educational institutions in any area or for bringing education of any category under their direct control.	None
The schools were thenceforth to vest in the Government absolutely (Cls. 14 and 15).	None
14.	None
By the provisions of the Bill the power to administer an educational institution was practically taken away from the management.	None
Managers of certain minority schools urged before the Court in that case that the protection of Art. 30(1) to minority educational institutions was in terms absolute and the State could not competently impose any restrictions upon the exercise of the right of administration or management.	None
On behalf of the State of Kerala it was submitted that by Art.	None
30(1) the minorities were merely invested with the fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice, and that right could be exercised by them so long as they cared to do so on their own resources fundamental right guaranteed by Art.	None
30(1) did not extend to getting assistance from the coffers of the State and if the minority institutions desired to obtain aid from the State they must submit to the terms on which the State offered aid to all other institutions established by other persons.	None
15.	None
The Court rejected the extreme contentions advanced by the managers of the educational institutions and by the State, and observed that the right to administer did not include a right to maladminister, and the minority could not ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by them in unhealthy surroundings, without any competent teachers possessing any semblance of qualification, and which did not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which taught matters subversive of the welfare of the scholars.	None
The constitutional right to administer an educational institution of their choice, it was observed, does not necessarily militate against the claim of the State to insist than in order to grant aid the State may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of institutions to be aided, but the State could not grant aid in such a manner as to take away fundamental right of the minority community under Art. 30 (1).	None
It was pointed out that under the Directive Principles of State Policy, under Arts.	None
41 to 46 it was the duty of the State to aid educational institutions and to promote the educational interests of minorities and weaker sections of the people.	None
Again, in the circumstances prevailing in the country, no educational institution could, in actual practice, be maintained without aid from the State and if it could not get it unless it surrendered its rights, it would, because of pressure of financial necesities, be compelled to give up its rights under Art. 30(1).	None
The State could not disregard or override the fundamental right by employing indirect methods of achieving exactly the same result.	None
16.	None
Even the legislature could not do in directly what it certainly could not do directly, and the effect of the application of some of those provisions of the Bill was substantially to override the provisions of Art.	None
30(1).	Reasoning
The Court then entered upon an examination of Cls.9, 10,11,12, and 13 and observed that they constituted serious inroads on the right of administration and appeared perilously near violating that right, but considering that those provisions were applicable to all educational institution and that the impugned parts of Cls. 9, 11 and 12 were designed to give protection and security to the illpaid teachers who were engaged in rendering service to the nation and to protect the backward classes, the Court was prepared to treat Cls.9,11(2) and 12 (4) as permissible regulations which the State might impose on the minorities as a condition for granting aid to their educational institutions.	None
But, it was observed, the clauses which authorised the taking over of management and vested the schools absolutely in the Government, purported, in effect, to annihilate the educational institutions of their choice could not be sustained under Art.	None
30(1).	Reasoning
It was therefore held that notwithstanding the absolute terms in which the fundamental freedom under Art.	None
30(1) was guaranteed, it was open to the State by legislation or by executive direction to impose reasonable regulations.	Reasoning
The Court did not, however, lay down any test of reasonableness of the regulation.	Reasoning
The Court did not decide that public or national interest was the sole measure or test of reasonableness it also did not decide that a regulation would be deemed unreasonable only if it was totally destructive of the right of the minority to administer the educational institution.	Reasoning
No general principle on which reasonableness or otherwise of a regulation may be tested was sought to be laid down by the Court.	Reasoning
1959	Reasoning
SCR 995 (AIR 1958 SC 956 ), therefore, is not an authority for the proposition submitted by the Additional Solicitor General that all regulative measures which are not destructive or annihilative of the character of the institution established by the minority, provided the regulation are in the national or public interest, are valid.	Reasoning
17.	None
The right established by Art. 30(1) is a fundamental right declared in terms absolute.	Reasoning
Unlike the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by Art.19 it is not subject to reasonable restrictions.	Reasoning
It is intended to be a real right for the protection of the minorities in the matter of setting up of educational institutions of their own choice.	Reasoning
The right is intended to be effective and is not to be whittled down by socalled regulative measures conceived in the interest not of the minority educational institution, but of the public or the nation as a whole.	Reasoning
If every order which while maintaining the formal character of a minority institutions destroys the power of administration is held justifiable because it is in the public or national interest, though not in its interest as an educational institution the right guaranteed by Art. 30(1) will be but a teasing illusion, a promise of unreality.	Reasoning
Regulations which may lawfully be imposed either by legislative or executive action as a condition of receiving grant or of recognition must be directed to making the institution while retaining its character as a minority institution effective as an educational institution.	Reasoning
Such regulation must satisfy an dual test  the test of reasonableness and the test that it is regulative of the educational character of the institution and is conducive to making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the minority community or other persons who resort to it.	Reasoning
18.	None
We are, therefore of the view that the R.3(2) of the Rules for Primary Training Colleges, and Rr.11 and 14 for recognition of Private Training institutions, in so far as they relate to reservation of seats therein under orders of Government, and directions given pursuant thereto regarding reservation of 80 of the seats and the threat to withhold rantinaid and recognition of the College, infringe the fundamental freedom guaranteed to the petitioners under Art. 30(1).	Reasoning
19.	None
The petitioners will therefore be entitled to writs in terms of prayers (a), (b), (c) and (d) in so far as the relate to reservation of seats under orders of Government, subject to the modification that reference to Cl. 12 of the rules in the prayers will be deleted in the writ.	Decision
The petitioners will be entitled to the costs of the petition.	Decision
