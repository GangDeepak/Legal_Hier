Arijit Pasayat, J. Appellants call in question legality of the judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court holding that the appellants stand about applicability of Section 25N of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (in short the Act) was not correct.	Issue
Controversy lies within a narrow compass.	None
Appellants were employees of the Haryana State Federation of Consumers Cooperative Wholesales Stores Limited (in short the CONFED), fourth respondent herein.	Facts
The service conditions of its employees are covered by CONFED Staff Service Rules, 1975 (in short the Rules).	Facts
On account of continued financial losses, a restructuring plan for gainful employment for employees was prepared.	Facts
It was noted that Retail Outlets (in short the ROL) were causing huge loss to the organization.	Facts
Therefore, it was decided that all ROL should be closed being financially nonviable.	Facts
Retrenchment compensation in terms of Section 25F of the Act was paid.	Facts
In the retrenchment order it was specifically stated as follows It is made clear that employees of CONFED from where the retrenchment is being effected are not covered by Chapter VB of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947, necessitating any permission under Section 25N of the said Act.	Facts
Therefore the retrenchment is being effected in accordance with Chapter VA by employing with Section 25F and other provisions of the said Chapter.	Facts
Questioning the retrenchment, writ petitions were filed before the High Court taking the stand that provisions of Section 25N and not Section 25F were applicable and in any event the appellants were entitled to the benefit in terms of Rule 35(b) of the Rules.	Facts
High Court did not find any substance in the stand and dismissed the Writ Petitions holding that there was compliance with the requirements of Section 25F(b) of the Act.	Facts
According to the learned counsel fo r the appellants the High Court has erroneously held that Section 25N has no application.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even otherwise, it was contended that the appellants were entitled to the benefits available under Rule 35(b).6.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was in this context submitted by the learned counsel for the appellants that after completion of the probation period, the appellants had become permanent employees and, therefore, they were governed by the Rules and the benefits under Rule 35(b) were clearly applicable.	Arguments of Petitioner
In response, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the High Courts view is in order.	Arguments of Respondent
In order to appreciate rival submissions the relevant provisions need to be noted.	None
Section 25F, 25K, 25L and 25N of the Act read as follows 25F Conditions precedent to retrenchment of workmen No workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall be retrenched by that employer until(a) the workman has been given one months notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired, or the workman has been paid in lieu of such notice, wages for the period of the notice(b) the workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days average pay (for every completed year of continuous service) or any part thereof in excess of six months and(c) notice in the prescribed manner is served on the appropriate Government (or such authority as may be specified by the appropriate Government by notification in the Official Gazette).25K Application of Chapter VB (1) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) in which not less than one hundred workmen were employed on an average per working day for the preceding twelve months.(2) If a question arises whether an industrial establishment is of a seasonal character or whether work is performed therein only intermittently, the decision of the appropriate Government thereon shall be final.25L	None

None
Section 25F appears in Chapter VA of the Act which relates to layoff and retrenchment.	Reasoning
Section 25K, L and N appear in Chapter VB which relates to special provisions relating to layoff, retrenchment and closure in certain establishments.	Reasoning
In other words Chapter VA deals with the general provisions relating to layoff and retrenchment, while special provisions have been made for certain establishments covered by Chapter VB.	Reasoning
Section 25N refers to workman in an industrial establishment.	Reasoning
The expression Industrial Establishment is defined in Section 25L, which means a factory or a mine or a plantation.	Reasoning
Admittedly, the employer is not covered by the definition of the Industrial Establishment.	Reasoning
Therefore, the High Court was right in holding that Section 25N has no application.	Reasoning
There is no dispute that the requirements of Section 25F have been complied with by the employer.	None
The residual question is whether any benefit was to be extended under Rule 35.	Issue

the maximum of one month.	None
The stand of the respondents was that the appellants were not confirmed employees.	None
The appointment order of each of the appellants contains the stipulations which are as follows Your appointment as Sales man is purely temporary.2.	None
During the period of probation, your services are liable to be terminated without giving any notice or assigning any reason.3.	None
You shall be governed by the terms and conditions contained in the Staff Service Rules of the Federation, amended from time to time.	None
This is a case where the period of probation is fixed having regard to Rule 4(b) read with Rule 10 as quoted above.	Reasoning
Rule 10(6) no doubt provides that no employee shall be deemed to have been confirmed in the service unless specific order in this regard is issued.	Reasoning
Relying on this provision, learned counsel for the fourth respondent submitted that there was no specific orders of confirmation and, therefore, the appellants should be deemed to have continued as probationers till the date of termination of their services.	Reasoning
A similar stand was considered in Om Prakash Maurya v. U.P. Co operative Sugar Factories Federation, Lucknow and Ors.	None
(AIR 1986 SC 1844 ).	None
A Constitution Bench of this Court in The State of Punjab v. Dharam Singh (AIR 1968 SC 1210 ) noted as follows Where as in the present case, the service rules fix a certain period of time beyond which the probationary period cannot be extended and an employee appointed or promoted to a post on probation is allowed to continue in the post after completion of the maximum period of probation without an express order of confirmation, he cannot be deemed to continue in that post as a probationer by implication.	None
The reason is that such an implication is negatived by the service rule forbidding extension of the probationary period beyond the maximum period fixed by it.	None
In such a case, it is permissible to draw the inference that the employee allowed to continue in the post on completion of the maximum period of probation has been confirmed in the post by implication.	None
In High Court of M.P. through Registrar and Ors.	None
v. Satya Narayan Jhavar (2001 (7) SCC 161 ), this Court categorised the provisions for probation as follows The question of deemed confirmation in service jurisprudence, which is dependent upon the language of the relevant service rules, has been the subjectmatter of consideration before this Court, times without number in various decisions and there are three lines of cases on this point.	None
One line of cases is where in the service rules or in the letter of appointment a period of probation is specified and power to extend the same is also conferred upon the authority without prescribing any maximum period of probation and if the officer is continued beyond the prescribed or extended period, he cannot be deemed to be confirmed.	None
In such cases there is no bar against termination at any point of time after expiry of the period of probation.	None
The other line of cases is that where while there is a provision in the rules for initial probation and extension thereof, a maximum period for such extension is also provided beyond which it is not permissible to extend probation.	None
The inference in such cases is that the officer concerned is deemed to have been confirmed upon expiry of the maximum period of probation in case before its expiry the order of termination has not been passed.	None
The last line of cases is where, though under the rules maximum period of probation is prescribed, but the same requires a specific act on the part of the employer by issuing an order of confirmation and of passing a test for the purposes of confirmation.	None
In such cases, even if the maximum period of probation has expired and neither any order of confirmation has been passed nor has the person concerned passed the requisite test, he cannot be deemed to have been confirmed merely because the said period has expired.	None
In above view of the matter, the stand of the appellants that they were deemed to have been confirmed at the end of 24 months and they were permanent employees is in terra firma.	Decision
Salesmen belong to Class III of the category of permanent employees.	Decision
The definition of Probationer given in Rule 4(b) fully supports the appellants stand that the probation period shall not exceed 24 months in all.	Decision
Therefore as was held in Om Prakashs case, Satya Narayan Jhavars case and Dharam Singhs case (supra) the appellants inferentially have to be treated as permanent employees, and consequently the benefits under Rule 35(b) were available to them.	Decision
But the same shall not be in addition to what is payable under Section 25F.	Decision
The amount which is higher of the two i.e. of Section 25F or Rule 35(b) shall be paid to the appellants.	Decision
If any amount has already been paid in terms of Section 25F the same shall be adjusted while making the payment under Rule 35(L), which shall be made within three months.	Decision
The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
