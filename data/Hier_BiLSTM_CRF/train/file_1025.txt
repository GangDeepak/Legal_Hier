However, the Tribunal noticed that the appellant is permanently disabled to an extent of 70 due to the injuries sustained by him in the accident.	Facts
In the absence of any authentic, reliable and acceptable proof produced by the appellant to show his monthly income, the Tribunal considering the fact that the appellant is a qualified Engineer, and having regard to the Schedule to the Workmens Compensation Act, fixed his monthly income notionally at Rs.3,000/ and considering his age at the time of accident, which is 34, applied the multiplier 17.

The Division Bench of the High Court, reassessed the entire case and opined that the Tribunal ought to have reasonably assessed the monthly salary which the appellant was getting at the time of accident.	Facts
However, taking into consideration, the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court fixed the monthly income of the appellant at Rs.5,000/ p.m., instead of Rs.3,000/ fixed by the Tribunal, and enhanced the compensation from Rs.5,15,700/, as awarded by the Tribunal, to Rs. 8,43,500/, which is inclusive of Rs.4,200/ awarded towards extra nourishment.

Being dissatisfied with the order of the High Court, the appellant filed this appeal before this Court by way of Special Leave Petition.	Facts
Learned counsel for the appellant contended that both the Tribunal and the High Court have erred in assessing the quantum of compensation payable to the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
The compensation awarded is not in consonance with the income and status of the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the date of accident, the appellant was a Tool and Die Engineer on permanent rolls of a company in Malaysia and was getting salary of Rs.50,000/ p.m., apart from other benefits.	Arguments of Petitioner
Being a well qualified and permanently employed person, the appellant apart from maintaining himself in Malaysia, was supporting his family at Kerala by sending substantial amount to them.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the High Court also failed to take into account the actual monthly income and status of the appellant, and has grossly erred in meagrely enhancing the monthly salary from Rs.3,000/ fixed by the Tribunal to Rs.5,000/ for the purpose of computing the compensation.	Arguments of Petitioner
At the time of accident, the appellant was only 34 years old and in view of the 70 permanent disability suffered during to the injuries sustained by him in the accident, he had lost all the growth avenues.	Arguments of Petitioner
He, therefore, submitted that the appellant, having regard to his qualification, profession and the salary drawn by him, was entitled to be awarded more compensation.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents, submitted that the grounds raised in this appeal claiming enhancement of compensation are absolutely devoid of merit.	Arguments of Respondent
The Division Bench of the High Court has adequately enhanced the amount of compensation by Rs. 3,27,800/, which is just and reasonable.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, it is submitted that the case of the appellant is without any substance and does not require interference from this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.	None
The only issue that arises for consideration is whether the compensation payable to the appellant has to be computed based on the assertion made by him that at the time of accident, he was working as Tool and Die Engineer in a company in Malaysia and drawing Rs. 50,000/ p.m.?	Issue
The appellant, before the Tribunal to prove his monthly income as Rs.50,000/ and in support of his claim for compensation, except examining himself as P.W.4, did not examine any person.	None
According to him, he was working as a Tool and Die Engineer in a company in Malaysia and getting Rs.50,000/ as monthly salary.	Reasoning
He did not even produce any authentic certificate to prove his income and qualification.	Reasoning
He has produced only a xerox copy of a certificate issued by the Institute of Engineers India showing that he has passed Sections A B of the Institutions examination in Mechanical Engineering branch.	Reasoning
Though the appellant failed to prove his income with documentary evidence, the fact that he was holding an engineering certificate and was working in Malaysia is not in dispute.	Reasoning
In the circumstances, taking into consideration the undisputed fact of his qualification, and particularly his working in overseas Company, we feel just and reasonable to consider his monthly income as Rs.	Reasoning
8,000/. Accordingly, taking the monthly salary of the appellant as Rs.8,000/, the compensation payable to him has to be computed.	Decision
Apart from that, we enhance the amounts payable to the appellant under different other heads in the manner following Loss of earnings (Rs.8,000/ x 6) minus Rs.18,000/Rs. 30,000/ more Loss of amenities (Rs.30,000/ minus Rs.10,000/)Rs.	None
