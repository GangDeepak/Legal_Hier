 Arijit Pasayat, J. These appeals involve identical issues and are, therefore, disposed of by this common judgment.	None
Challenge in these appeals is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court.	Issue
Factual background is almost undisputed and the controversy relates to the scope and ambit of Rule 11 of the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings) Rules, 1974 (in short the Ceiling Rules?).	Issue
The appellants were holding land in excess of the limit prescribed under the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings) Act, 1973 (in short the Act?).	Facts
The surplus land was surrendered by them which had cashew nut tree plantation.	Facts
On the surrendered land the trees were fruit bearing trees.	Facts
The dispute relates to the amount payable in respect of fruit bearing trees standing on the land which were surrendered by the appellant.	Facts
The number of trees is also not in dispute.	Facts
The amount payable for the land vested in the Government the amounts were duly paid.	Facts
With regard to the amount payable for fruit bearing trees a Commissioner was appointed, who submitted a report regarding number of fruit bearing trees and other trees standing on the land so surrendered.	Facts
The Commissioner of Land Reforms Urban Ceiling, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh directed the District Collector to issue necessary instructions not to fix the compensation payable in respect of the trees under the Rules until further orders.	Facts

Writ petitions were filed before the High Court which came to be dismissed by the impugned orders.	Facts
Mr. M.N. Rao, learned Senior Counsel for the appellants submitted that the High Court is not correct in its view that the appellants are not entitled to get the amount for 30 years and in accepting the stand of the Government that it was payable only for one year.	Arguments of Petitioner
4. Learned Counsel for the respondentState on the other submitted the view of the High Court is clearly unexceptionable.	Arguments of Respondent
The purpose and object of the Statute under which the lands were surrendered cannot be lost sight of.	Arguments of Respondent

BY AUTHORITY NELLORE APRIL 23, 1982 NOTIFICATION	None
The following sentence may be added to the Notification published Nellore District Gazette (Extraordinary) dated 31.3.1982.	None
The seignorage rate in the column No. 7 are the rate of trees per year and the tree will yield for 30 years.	None
The seignorage rate per tree is to be calculated for 30 years.	None
Sd  H.K. Babu, District Collector, Nellore.	None
Dt. 23.4.1982 U.M. No. 97/82?	None
A bare reading thereof makes the position clear that the amounts are to be calculated from 5th to 30th years.	Reasoning
That being so, the stand of the State Government as accepted by the High Court that the seignorage rate is for one year and accordingly fixing it for the 12 years is clearly unsustainable.	Reasoning
It is to be noted that the trees were 12 years old and stood on the surrendered land.	Reasoning
It is further clear that up to 5 years cashew trees are held to be not fruit bearing trees.	Reasoning
The emphasis for the State was that the object of the concerned statue was not to confer any benefit beyond the statutory entitlements and for that purpose according to learned Counsel for the State the object of the statute was vital.	Reasoning
According to him for the purpose of construction of the notifications of the District Collector, the same has to be read in a manner which would give true effect to the intention of the statute.	Reasoning
We shall deal with this plea in some detail.	None
It is said that a statute is an edict of the Legislature.	Reasoning
The elementary principle of interpreting or construing a statute is to gather the mens or sententia legis of the Legislature.	Reasoning
It is well settled principle in law that the Court cannot read anything into a statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous.	Reasoning
Interpretation postulates the search for the true meaning of the words used in the statute as a medium of expression to communicate a particular thought.	Reasoning
The task is not easy as the ?language?	Reasoning
is often misunderstood even in ordinary conversation or correspondence.	Reasoning
The tragedy is that although in the matter of correspondence or conversation the person who has spoken the words or used the language can be approached for clarification, the Legislature cannot be approached as the Legislature, after enacting a law or Act, becomes functus officio so far as that particular Act is concerned and it cannot itself interpret it.	Reasoning
No doubt, the Legislature retains the power to amend or repeal the law so made and can also declare its meaning, but that can be done only by making another law or statute after undertaking the whole process of lawmaking.	Reasoning
Statute being an edict of the Legislature, it is necessary that it is expressed in clear and unambiguous language.	None
In spite of Courts saying so, the draftsmen have paid little attention and they still boast of the old British jingle ?	None
I am the parliamentary draftsman.	None
I compose the country?s laws.	None
And of half of the litigation, I am undoubtedly the cause?, which was referred to by this Court in Palace Admn.	None

In Kirby v. Leather, 1965 (2) All ER 441, the draftsmen were severely criticized in regard to Section 22(2)(b) of the (UK) Limitation Act, 1939, as it was said that the Section was so obscure that the draftsmen must have been of unsound mind.	None
Where, however, the words were clear, there is no obscurity, there is no ambiguity and the intention of the Legislature is clearly conveyed, there is no scope for the Court to innovate or take upon itself the task of amending or altering the statutory provisions.	Reasoning
In that situation the Judges should not proclaim that they are playing the role of a lawmaker merely for an exhibition of judicial valour.	Reasoning
They have to remember that there is a line, though thin, which separates adjudication from legislation.	Reasoning
That line should not be crossed or erased.	Reasoning
This can be vouchsafed by ?an alert recognition of the necessity not to cross it and instinctive, as well as trained reluctance to do so?.	None
(See Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes in ?	None

Words and phrases are symbols that stimulate mental references to referents.	Reasoning
The object of interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it.	Reasoning
See Institute of Chartered Accountants of India v. M s. Price Waterhouse and Anr., AIR 1998 SC 74 .	Reasoning
The intention of the Legislature is primarily to be gathered from the language used, which means that attention should be paid to what has been said as also to what has not been said.	Reasoning
As a consequence, a construction which requires for its support, addition or substitution of words or which results in rejection of words as meaningless has to be avoided.	Reasoning
As observed in Crawford v. Spooner, (1846 (6) Moore PC 1), Courts, cannot aid the Legislatures?	None
defective phrasing of an Act, we cannot add or mend, and by construction make up deficiencies which are left there.	None

Etc. AIR 1977 SC 842 , it was observed that Courts must avoid the danger of a prior, determination of the meaning of a provision based on their own preconceived notions of ideological structure or scheme into which the provision to be interpreted is somewhat fitted.	None
They are not entitled to usurp legislative function under the disguise of interpretation.	None
While interpreting a provision the Court only interprets the law and cannot legislate it.	None
If a provision of law is misused and subjected to the abuse of process of law, it is for the Legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if deemed necessary.	None

SLT 3932005 (10) SCC 437.	None
The residual question is the number of years for which the Seignorage rates are to be computed.	Issue
We do not find any substance in the plea of learned Counsel for the appellants that the entitlement of the appellants is for 30 years.	Reasoning
Admittedly the trees were 12 years old at the time the land were surrendered and, therefore, for the balance 18 years only the appellants will be entitled to at the relevant seignorage rates.	Reasoning
Therefore, the amount payable for each 12 years old cashew tree at the seignorage rates, as per the Notification dated 21.3.1982 (as amended by Notification dated 23.4.1982) will be the seignorage rate for 12 years tree?	Decision
multiplied by the remaining age of the tree?	Decision
that is Rs.85x 18 Rs. 1,530.	Decision
The amount shall be paid within 3 months, along with other statutory entitlements, if any.	Decision
The appeals are accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
