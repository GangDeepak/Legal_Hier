13.	None
The High Court on appeal upheld the judgment and order and found that the alleged claims of the appellants were very strongly and substantially denied and disputed.	Facts
14.	None
The first claim for erection of plant and machinery was totally denied by the company.	Facts
The defences were first that the books of the company showed no such transactions secondly, there was no privity between the company and the persons in whose names the appellants made the claims thirdly, the alleged claims were barred by limitation and, fourthly, there was never any demand for the alleged claims either by those persons or by the appellants.	Facts
The alleged claims for interest and commission were therefore equally baseless according to the defence of the company.	Facts
15.	None
The second claim for compensation was denied on the grounds that the appellants were not entitled to any compensation for use of the portion of the shed and the alleged claim was barred by limitation.	Facts
As to the claim for compensation the company relied on the resolution of the Board of Directors at which the Katakia Brothers were present as Directors.	Facts
The Board resolved confirmation of the arrangement with M s. Ravi Industries for use of the premises for the running of the industry at their shed at a monthly rent of Rs. 4,250.	Facts
Prima facie the resolution repelled any claim for compensation or interest on compensation.	Facts
16.	None

The receipt for such payment was produced before the learned trial Judge.	Facts
The appellants also admitted the same.	Facts
As to the other two invoices for Rs. 14,650 and for Rs. 36,000 the amounts appeared in the companys books.	Facts
According to the company the claim of the appellants was for Rs.	Facts
72,556.01 and the case of the company was that there was a settlement of the claim at Rs. 14,650.00.	Facts
17.	None
The High Court correctly gave four principal reasons to reject the claims of the appellants to wind up the company as creditors.	Reasoning
First, that the books of account of the company did not show the alleged claims of the appellants save and except the sum of Rs. 72,556.01.	Reasoning
Second, many of the alleged claims are barred by limitation.	Reasoning
There is no allegation by the appellants to support acknowledgement of any claim to oust the plea of limitation.	Reasoning
Thirdly, the Katakia Brothers who were the Directors resigned in the month of August, 1969 and their three shares were transferred in the month of December, 1969 and up to the month of December, 1969 there was not a single letter of demand to the company in respect of any claim.	Reasoning
Fourthly, one of Katakia Brothers was the Chairman of the Board of Directors and therefore the Katakias were in the knowledge as to the affairs of the company and the books of accounts and they signed the balance sheets which did not reflect any claim of the appellants except the two invoices for the amounts of Rs. 14,650 and Rs. 36,000.	Reasoning
The High Court characterised the claim of the appellants as tainted by the vice of dishonesty.	Reasoning
18.	None
The alleged debts of the appellants are disputed, denied, doubted and at least in one instance proved to be dishonest by the production of a receipt granted by the appellants.	Reasoning
The books of the company do not show any of the claims excepting in respect of two invoices for Rs. 14,650 and Rupees 36,000.	Reasoning
It was said by the appellants that the books would not bind the appellants.	Reasoning
The appellants did not give any statutory notice to raise any presumption of inability to pay debt.	Reasoning
The appellants would therefore be required to prove their claim.	Reasoning
19.	None
This Court in Amalgamated Commercial Traders (P) Ltd., v. A. C. K. Krishnaswami, (1965) 35 Com Cas 456 (SC), dealt with a petition to wind up the company on the ground that the company was indebted to the petitioner there for a sum of Rs. 1,750 being the net dividend amount payable on 25 equity shares which sum the company failed and neglected to pay in spite of notice of demand.	None
There were other shareholders supporting the winding up on identical grounds.	None
The company alleged that there was no debt due and that the company was in a sound financial position.	None
The resolution of the company declaring a dividend made the payment of the dividend contingent on the receipt of the commission from two sugar mills.	None
The commission was not received till the month of May, 1960.	None
The resolution was in the month of December, 1959.	None
Under Section 207 of the Companies Act a company was required to pay a dividend which had been declared within three months from the date of the declaration.	None
A company cannot declare a dividend payable beyond three months.	None
This Court held that the nonpayment of dividend was bona fide disputed by the company.	None
It was not a dispute to hide its inability to pay the debts.	None
20.	None
Two rules are well settled.	Reasoning
First if the debt is bona fide disputed and the defence is a substantial one, the Court will not wind up the company.	Reasoning
The court has dismissed.	Reasoning
a petition for winding up where the creditor claimed a sum for goods sold to the company and the company contended that no price had been agreed upon and the sum demanded by the creditor was unreasonable (See London and Paris Banking Corporation, (1874) 19	Reasoning
Eq. 444).	Reasoning
Again, a petition for winding up by a creditor who claimed payment of an agreed sum for work done for the company when the company contended that the work had not been done properly was not allowed.	Reasoning
(See Re.	Reasoning
Brighton Club and Norfolk Hotel Co. Ltd., (1865) 35 Beav. 204).	Reasoning
21.	None
Where the debt is undisputed the Court will not act upon a defence that the company has the ability to pay the debt but the company chooses not to pay that particular debt (See Re.	Reasoning
A Company 94 SJ 369).	Reasoning
Where however there is no doubt that the company owes the creditor a debt entitling him to a winding up order but the exact amount of the debt is disputed the Court will make a winding up order without requiring the creditor to quantify the debt precisely (See Re.	Reasoning
Tweeds Garages Ltd., 1962 Ch.	Reasoning
406).The principles on which the court acts are first that the defence of the company is in good faith and one of substance, secondly, the defence is likely to succeed in point of law and thirdly the company adduces prima facie proof of the facts on which the defence depends.	Reasoning
22.	None
Another rule which the Court follows is that if there is opposition to the making of the winding up order by the creditors the Court will consider their wishes and may decline to make the winding up order.	Reasoning
Under Section 557 of the Companies Act, 1956 in all matters relating to the winding up of the company the Court may ascertain the wishes of the creditors.	Reasoning
The wishes of the shareholders are also considered though perhaps the Court may attach greater weight to the views of the creditors.	Reasoning
The law on this point is stated in Palmers Company Law, 21st Edition page 742 as follows This right to a winding up order is, however, qualified by another rule, viz., that the Court will regard the wishes of the majority in value of the creditors, and if, for some good reason, they object to a winding up order, the Court in its discretion may refuse the order.	Reasoning
The wishes of the creditors will however be tested by the Court on the grounds as to whether the case of the persons opposing the winding up is reasonable secondly whether there are matters which should be inquired into and investigated if a winding up order is made.	Reasoning
It is also well settled that a winding up order will not be made on a creditors petition if it would not benefit him or the companys creditors generally.	Reasoning
The grounds furnished by the creditors opposing the winding up will have an important bearing on the reasonable of the case, (See Re.	Reasoning
P. and J. Wacrae Ltd., (1961) 1	Reasoning
All ER 302).	Reasoning
23.	None
In the present case the claims of the appellants axe disputed in fact and in law.	Reasoning
The Company has given prima facie evidence that the appellants are not entitled to any claim for erection work, because there was no transaction between the company and the appellants or those persons in whose names the appellants claimed the amounts.	Reasoning
The company has raised the defence of lack of privity.	Reasoning
The company has raised the defence of limitation.	Reasoning
As to the appellants, claim for compensation for use of shed the company denies any privity between the company and the appellants.	Reasoning
The company has proved the resolution of the company that the company will pay rent to Ravi Industries for the use of the shed.	Reasoning
As to the three claims of the appellants for invoices one is proved by the company to be utterly unmeritorious.	Reasoning
The Company produced a receipt granted by the appellants for the invoice amount.	Reasoning
The falsehood of the appellants claim has been exposed.	Reasoning
The Company however stated that the indebtedness is for the sum of Rs. 14,850 and the company alleges the agreement between the company and the appellants that payment will be made out of the proceeds of sale.	Reasoning
On these facts and on the principles of law to which reference has been made the High Court was correct in refusing the order for winding up.	Reasoning
24.	None
Since the inception of the company Jayantilal Katakia a partner of the appellants was the Chairman of the Company until 22 August, 1969.	Reasoning
His two brothers were also Directors of the Company since its inception till 22 August, 1969.	Reasoning
The Bombay group had also Directors of the Company.	Reasoning
25.	None
The Company proved the unanimous resolution of the Board at a meeting held on 21 June, 1969 for sale of machinery of the company.	Reasoning
The Katakia Brothers were present at the meeting.	Reasoning
The Katakia Brothers thereafter sold their three shares to the Valia group.	Reasoning
The cumulative evidence in support of the case of the company is not only that the Katakia Brothers consented to and approved of the sale of machinery but also parted with their shares of the Company.	Reasoning
The three shares were sold by the Katakia Brothers shortly after each of them had written a letter on 27 July 1969 expressly stating that they had no objection to the sale of the machinery and the letter was issued in order to enable the company to hold an Extraordinary General meeting on the subject.	Reasoning
The Company relied on the resolution of the Board meeting on 24 October, 1969 where it was recorded that the Valia group would sell their 367 shares and 3 other shares which they had purchased from the appellants to the Nandkishore group and the appellants would accept Rs 14,850 in settlement of the sum of Rs. 72, 000 due from the company and the company would make that payment out of proceeds of sale of the machinery.	Reasoning
The Board at a meeting held on 17 September, 1969 resolved that the proposal of R. K. Khanna to purchase the machinery be accepted.	Reasoning
On 20 December, 1969 an agreement was signed between R. K. Khanna and the company for the sale of the machinery.	Reasoning
At the Annual General Meeting of the company on 8 January, 1970 the Resolution for, sale of the machinery was unanimously passed by the company.	Reasoning
26.	None
It is in this background that the appellants impeached the proposed sale of the machinery as unauthorised and improvident.	Reasoning
The appellants themselves were parties to the proposed sale.	Reasoning
The appellants themselves wanted to buy the machinery at a higher figure.	Reasoning
These matters are within the province of the management of the company.	Reasoning
Where the shareholders have approved of the sale it cannot be said that the transaction is unauthorised or improvident according to the wishes of the shareholders.	None
27.	None
It will appear from the judgment of the High Court that the creditors for the sum of Rs. 7,50,000 supported the company and resisted the appellants application for winding up.	Reasoning
There was some controversy as to whether all the creditors appeared or not.	Reasoning
At the hearing of this appeal the company gave, a list of the creditors and notices were issued to the creditors.	Reasoning
Apart from the appellants, two other creditors who supported the appellants were Ravi Industries Ltd. whose name appears as one of the creditors as on 2 August, 1971 in the list of creditors furnished by the company and K. S. Patel and Co. with a claim for Rupees 44,477,56 though their name does not appear in the list.	Reasoning
Among the creditors who supported the company the largest amount was represented by Nandkishore and Company with a claim for Rupees 4. 95,999.	Reasoning
The two creditors who supported the claim of the appellants in regard to the prayer for winding up were Ravi Industries Ltd. with a claim for Rupees 2,97,500 on account of rent and K. S. Patel and Co. of Bombay with a claim for Rupees 44.477.56.	Reasoning
It may be stated here that this claim of Rs.	Reasoning
44,477.56 was made on account of erection work of machinery and this identical claim was included in the list of expenses claimed by the appellants on account of erection work.	Reasoning
The company disputed the claim.	Reasoning
The High Court correctly found that the appellants could not sustain the claim to support winding up.	Reasoning
It is surprising that a claim of the year 1965 was never pursued until it was included as an item of debt in the petition for winding up the company.	Reasoning
With regard to the claim for rent, the company pursuant to an agreement between the company and Ravi Industries Private Ltd. credited Rowe Industries with the sum of Rupees 1,52,000 with the result that a sum of Rupees 1,45, 500 would be payable by the company to Ravi Industries Ltd. in respect of rent.	Reasoning
The company alleges that Ravi Industries Pvt. Ltd. supported the company in the High Court and that they have taken a completely different position in this Court.	Reasoning
In this Court the company has also relied on a piece of writing dated 24 September, 1971 wherein Ravi Industries Private Ltd. acknowledged payment of Rupees 1,52,000 to Rowe Industries Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. and further agreed to write off the amount of Rupees 1,45,500.	Reasoning
Ravi Industries Pvt. Ltd. is disputing the same.	Reasoning
This appears to be a matter of substantial dispute.	Reasoning
The Court cannot go into these questions to settle debts with doubts.	Reasoning
28.	None
Counsel for the appellants extracted observations from the judgment of the High Court that it was never in dispute that the company was insolvent and it was therefore contended that the company should be wound up.	Reasoning
Broadly stated, the balancesheet shows the share capital of the company to be Rupees 5,51,500, the liabilities to be Rupees 9,77,829.77 and the assets to be Rs. 8,87,177.93.	Reasoning
The assets were less than the liability by Rupees 90,000.	Reasoning
Accumulated losses of the company for five years appear to be Rupees 6,21,177.53.	Reasoning
The plant and machinery which are shown in the balancesheet at Rs. 6.07,544.58 are agreed to be sold at Rs. 4,50.000.	Reasoning
There would then be a shortfall in the value of the fixed insets by about Rupees 1,50,000 and if that amount is added to the sum of Rupees 90,000 representing the difference between the assets and liabilities the shortfall in the assets of the company would be about Rupees 2,50.000.	Reasoning
29.	None
The appellants contended that the shortfall in the assets of the company by about Rupees 2,50,000 after the sale of the machinery would indicate first that the substratum of the company was gone and secondly that the company was insolvent.	Arguments of Petitioner
An allegation that the substratum of the company is gone is to be alleged and proved as a fact.	Arguments of Petitioner
The sale of the machinery was alleged in the petition for winding up to indicate that the substratum of the company had disappeared.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also said that there was no possibility of the company doing business at a profit.	Arguments of Petitioner
In determining whether or not the substratum of the company has gone, the objects of the company and the case of the company on that question will have to be looked into.	None
In the present case the company alleged that with the proceeds of sale the company intended to enter into some other profitable business.	None
The mere fact that the company has suffered trading losses will not destroy its substratum unless there is no reasonable prospect of it ever making a profit in the future, and the Court is reluctant to hold that it has no such prospect (See Re.	Reasoning
Suburban Hotel Co., (1867) 2	Reasoning
Ch App 737 and Davis and Co v. Brunswick (Australia) Ltd. (1936) 1	Reasoning
All ER 299)	Reasoning
The company alleged trial out of the proceeds of sale of machinery the company would have sufficient money for carrying on export business even if the company were to take into consideration the amount of Rupees 1,45,000 alleged to be due on account of rent.	Reasoning
Export business, buying and selling yarn and commission agency are some of the business which the company can carry on within its objects.	Reasoning
One of the Directors of the Company is Kishore Nandlal Shah who carries on export business under the name and style of M s. Nandkishore and Co in partnership with others Nandkishore and Company are creditors of the Company to the extent of Rupees 4,92,000.	Reasoning
The company will not have to meet that claim now.	Reasoning
On the contrary, the Nandkishore group will bring in money to the company.	Reasoning
This Nandkishore group is alleged by the company to help the company in the export business.	Reasoning
The Company has not abandoned objects of business.	Reasoning
There is no such allegation or proof.	Reasoning
It cannot in the facts and circumstances of the present case be held that the substratum of the company is gone Nor can it be held in the facts and circumstances of the present case that the company is unable to meet the outstandings of any of its admitted creditors.	Reasoning
The company has deposited in Court the disputed claims of the appellants.	Reasoning
The company has not ceased carrying on its business.	Reasoning
Therefore the company will meet the dues as and when they fall due.	Reasoning
The company has reasonable prospect of business and resources.	None
30.	None
Counsel on behalf of the company contended that the appellants presented the petition out of improper motive.	Arguments of Respondent
Improper motive can be spelt out where the petition is presented to coerce the company in satisfying some groundless claims made against it by the petitioner.	None
The facts and circumstances of the present case indicate that motive.	None
The appellants were Directors.	Reasoning
They sold their shares.	Reasoning
They went out of the management of the company in the month of August, 1969, They were parties to the proposed sale.	Reasoning
Just when the sale of the machinery was going to be effected the appellants.	Reasoning
presented a petition for winding up.	Reasoning
In the recent English decision in Mann v. Goldstein, (1968) 1 WLR 1091 it was held that even though it appeared from the evidence that the company was insolvent, as the debts were substantially disputed the Court restrained the prosecution of the petition as an abuse of the process of the Court.	Reasoning
It is apparent that the appellant, did not present the petition for any legitimate purpose.	Reasoning
31.	None
The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed with costs.	Decision
The Company and the supporting creditors will get one hearing fee.	Decision
The amount of Rupees 72,000 which was deposited in Court will remain deposited in the Court for a period of eight weeks from this date and if in the meantime no suit is filed by the appellants within eight weeks the Company will be at liberty to withdraw the amount by filing the necessary application.	Decision
In the event of the suit being filed within this period the amount will remain to the credit of the suit.	Decision
32.	None
Appeal dismissed.	None
