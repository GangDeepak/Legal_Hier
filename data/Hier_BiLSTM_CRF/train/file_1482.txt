The Board of Directors of Subuthi at its meeting held on 1.3.2006 approved the said agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
There was however no such approval by the Board of Directors of Indowind.	Arguments of Respondent
According to Indowind, Wescare sold 31 Wind Electric Generators (WEGs) to Indowind on 15.3.2006 for a consideration of Rs.13,48,00,700/, out of which Rs.4.5 crores was paid in cash and Rs.8.84 crores by allotment of 884,000 shares of Indowind to Wescare.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, towards the purchase of another 8 WEGs from Wescare, Indowind allotted 58,000 shares.	Arguments of Respondent
According to Wescare, certain disputes arose between Wescare on the one hand and Subuthi and Indowind on the other, in respect of the said agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
Wescare filed three petitions under section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (the Act, for short) against Subuthi and Indowind seeking the following interim measures (i) OA No.641/2007 to restrain Subuthi and Indowind from alienating, encumbering or otherwise disposing of the 31 WEGs and the land appurtenant thereto.(ii) OA NO.642/2007 to restrain Subuthi and Indowind from operating or running the WEGs pending completion of arbitration proceedings.(iii)	Arguments of Respondent
OA NO.975/2007 to restrain Indowind from proceeding with the issue of initial public offer, proposed under the Red Herring Prospectus issued by it, pending final disposal of the arbitration proceedings.6.	Arguments of Respondent
The said applications were dismissed by a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Curt on 21.8.2007, holding as follows (a) As Indowind has not signed nor ratified the agreement dated 24.2.2006, the maintainability of the applications under section 9 of the Act was doubtful.(b)	Arguments of Respondent
As the WEGs were purchased by Indowind after paying the entire sale consideration, Wescare was not entitled to an injunction restraining Indowind from alienating the WEGs.	Arguments of Respondent
The order however clarified that whatever had been stated therein was in the context of disposal of the applications seeking interim measures under section 9 of the Act and nothing contained therein should be construed as findings on merits and the Arbitrator should determine the issues raised before him uninfluenced by the observations made in the said order.7.	Arguments of Respondent
Wescare filed a petition under section 11(6) of the Act against Subuthi and Indowind for appointment of a sole arbitrator to arbitrate upon the disputes between them in respect of agreement dated 24.2.2006.	Arguments of Respondent
Subuthi resisted the said petition alleging that as the agreement dated 24.2.2006 did not contemplate any transaction between Wescare and itself (Subuthi) and as no transaction took place between Wescare and Subuthi under the agreement dated 24.2.2006, there was no cause of action nor any arbitrable dispute between them.	Arguments of Respondent
Indowind resisted the petition on the ground that it was not a party to the agreement dated 24.2.2006 entered into between Wescare and Subuthi that it had not ratified the agreement dated 24.2.2006 or acted upon it that there was no arbitration agreement between Wescare and Indowind that the transactions of purchase of 31 WEGs were neither covered by nor in pursuance of the agreement dated 24.2.2006 and therefore the petition was liable to be dismissed.8.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Chief Justice of the Madras High Court allowed the said application under section 11 of the Act, by the impugned order dated 1.8.2008 and appointed a sole arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Chief Justice held that Indowind was prima facie a party to the arbitration agreement and was bound by it, even though it was not a signatory to the agreement dated 24.2.2006.	Arguments of Respondent
His conclusion was based on the following findings (a) Execution of the agreement dated 24.2.2006 between Wescare and Subuthi containing the arbitration agreement, was not in dispute.(b)	Arguments of Respondent
Subuthi is one of the promoters of Indowind.	Arguments of Respondent
Both of them had a common registered office and common Directors.	Arguments of Respondent
The correspondence emanating from Indowind was signed by Raja Sukumar who was the signatory on behalf of Subuthi in the agreement dated 24.2.2006.	Arguments of Respondent
By lifting the corporate veil, it could be seen that Subuthi and Indowind was one and the same party.(c)	Arguments of Respondent
The agreement dated 24.2.2006 described Subuthi as the promoter of Indowind and also described Indowind as the nominee of Subuthi.	Arguments of Respondent
Subuthi had entered into an agreement for purchase of the business assets of Wescare for its nominee Indowind.	Arguments of Respondent
The signatory to the agreement on behalf of Subuthi was also a Director of Indowind.(d)	Arguments of Respondent
The agreement dated 24.2.2006 contemplated Indowind purchasing the assets of Wescare including the WEGs.	Arguments of Respondent
and making payment therefor, both in cash and by allotment of shares.	Arguments of Respondent
Indowind had in fact purchased from Wescare 39 WEGs.	Facts
in March, 2006, the consideration for which was paid partly in cash and partly by allotment of shares, thereby indicating that Indowind acted in terms of the agreement dated 24.2.2006.(e)	Arguments of Respondent
The Red Herring Prospectus issued by Indowind in connection with the public issue of equity shares gives a clear indication that it is bound by the agreement dated 24.2.2006 between Wescare and Subuthi (vide Risk Factor Nos.30 and 31).(f)	Arguments of Respondent
Signature of a party is not a formal requirement of an arbitration agreement either under subsection (4)(b) and (c) or under subsection (5) of section 7 of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, Indowind could be held to be a party to the agreement dated 24.2.2006, even if it had not executed the said agreement.9	Arguments of Respondent
The said judgment is challenged in this appeal by special leave.	Arguments of Respondent
On the contentions urged the following two questions arise for consideration(i) Whether an arbitration clause found in a document (agreement) between two parties, could be considered as a binding arbitration agreement on a person who is not a signatory to the agreement?(ii) Whether a company could be said to be a party to a contract containing an arbitration agreement, even though it did not sign the agreement containing an arbitration clause, with reference to its subsequent conduct?10.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 7 defines an arbitration agreement and it is extracted below 7.	Arguments of Respondent
Arbitration agreement.(1)	Facts
In this Part, arbitration agreement means an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not.(2)	Arguments of Respondent
An arbitration agreement may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement.(3)	Arguments of Respondent
An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.(4)	Facts
An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is contained in(a) a document signed by the parties(b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement or(c) an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of the agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other,(5)	Arguments of Respondent
The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to make that arbitration clause part of the contract.	Arguments of Respondent
The term party is defined in section 2(h) as referring to a party to an arbitration agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
The term arbitration agreement is defined under section 2(b) as an agreement referred to in section 7.	Arguments of Respondent
An analysis of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 7 shows that an arbitration agreement will be considered to be in writing if it is contained in (a) a document signed by the parties or (b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement or (c) an exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the existence of the agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other, or (d) a contract between the parties making a reference to another document containing an arbitration clause indicating a mutual intention to incorporate the arbitration clause from such other document into the contract.11.	Arguments of Respondent
It is fundamental that a provision for arbitration to constitute an arbitration agreement for the purpose of section 7 should satisfy two conditions (i) it should be between the parties to the dispute and (ii) it should relate to or be applicable to the dispute.	Arguments of Respondent
See Yogi Agrawal v. Inspiration Clothes U Ors.  	Facts
2009 (1) SCC 372 .12.	Facts
Wescare has not entered into any agreement with Indowind, referring to the agreement dated 24.2.2006 containing the arbitration agreement, with the intention of making such arbitration agreement, a part of the their agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
Nor is it the case of Wescare that there has been any exchange of statements of claim and defence in which it had alleged the existence of an arbitration agreement and the same had been accepted and not denied by Indowind in the defence statement.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also not the case of Wescare that any exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication referred to and provided a record of any arbitration agreement between the parties.	Arguments of Respondent
It therefore follows that neither subsection (5) nor clauses (b) and (c) of subsection (4) of section 7 applies.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, what remains to be seen is whether there is any document signed by parties, as provided in clause (a) of subsection (4) of section 7.13.	Arguments of Respondent
Wescare puts forth the agreement dated 24.2.2006 as an agreement signed by the parties containing an arbitration agreement but the said agreement is signed by Wescare and Subuthi and not by Indowind.	Arguments of Respondent
It is not in dispute that there can be appointment of an arbitrator if there was any dispute between Wescare and Subuthi.	Arguments of Respondent
The question is when Indowind is not a signatory to the agreement dated 24.2.2006, whether it can be considered to be a party to the arbitration agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
In the absence of any document signed by the parties as contemplated under clause (a) of subsection (4) of section 7, and in the absence of existence of an arbitration agreement as contemplated in clauses (b) or (c) of subsection (4) of section 7 and in the absence of a contract which incorporates the arbitration agreement by reference as contemplated under subsection (5) of section 7, the inescapable conclusion is that Indowind is not a party to the arbitration agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
In the absence of an arbitration agreement between Wescare and Indowind, no claim against Indowind or no dispute with Indowind can be the subjectmatter of reference to an arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
This is evident from a plain, simple and normal reading of section 7 of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant and respondents 1 and 2 are companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956.	Arguments of Respondent
Wescare Care (I) Ltd., the first respondent (for short Wescare), is in the business of setting up and operating managing windfarms and generation of power from Wind Electric Generators.	Arguments of Respondent

Arguments of Respondent
In the absence of an arbitration agreement between Wescare and Indowind, no claim against Indowind or no dispute with Indowind can be the subjectmatter of reference to an arbitrator.	Arguments of Respondent
This is evident from a plain, simple and normal reading of section 7 of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
It is not in dispute that Subuthi and Indowind are two independent companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956.	None
Each company is a separate and distinct legal entity and the mere fact that two companies have common shareholders or common Board of Directors, will not make the two companies a single entity.	None
Nor will existence of common shareholders or Directors lead to an inference that one company will be bound by the acts of the other.	None
If the Director who signed on behalf of Subuthi was also a Director of Indowind and if the intention of the parties was that Indowind should be bound by the agreement, nothing prevented Wescare insisting that Indowind should be made a party to the agreement and requesting the Director who signed for Subuthi also to sign on behalf of Indowind.	None
The very fact that parties carefully avoided making Indowind a party and the fact that the Director of Subuthi though a Director of Indowind, was careful not to sign the agreement as on behalf of Indowind, shows that the parties did not intend that Indowind should be a party to the agreement.	None
Therefore the mere fact that Subuthi described Indowind as its nominee or as a company promoted by it or that the agreement was purportedly entered by Subuthi on behalf of Indowind, will not make Indowind a party in the absence of a ratification, approval, adoption or confirmation of the agreement dated 24.2.2006 by Indowind.	None
Clause 11 of the agreement dated 24.2.2006 categorically states that the agreement shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever unless it is expressly approved by the respective Board of Directors shareholders of Wescare, Subuthi and Indowind.	None
It is admitted that the Board of Directors of Wescare and Subuthi approved the agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
But the Board of Directors or the shareholders of Indowind did not approve the agreement.	None
In the absence of such approval by Indowind, and in the absence of Indowind being a party or signatory to the agreement dated 24.2.2006, it is ununderstandable as to how Indowind can be deemed to be a party to the agreement dated 24.2.2006 and consequently a party to the arbitration agreement contained therein.	Arguments of Respondent
Wescare referred to several acts and transactions as also the conduct of Indowind to contend that an inference should be drawn that Indowind was a party to the agreement or that it had affirmed and approved the agreement or acted in terms of the agreement.	None
An examination of the transactions between the parties to decide whether there is a valid contract or whether a particular party owed any obligation towards another party or whether any person had committed a breach of contract, will be possible in a suit or arbitration proceeding claiming damages or performance.	None
But the issue in a proceeding under section 11 is not whether there was any contract between the parties or any breach thereof.	None
A contract can be entered into even orally.	None
A contract can be spelt out from correspondence or conduct.	None
But an arbitration agreement is different from a contract.	None
An arbitration agreement can come into existence only in the manner contemplated under section 7.	None
If section 7 says that an arbitration agreement should be in writing, it will not be sufficient for the petitioner in an application under section 11 to show that there existed an oral contract between the parties, or that Indowind had transacted with Wescare, or Wescare had performed certain acts with reference to Indowind, as proof of arbitration agreement.	None
A Constitution Bench of this Court in Economic Transport Organisation v. M s. Charan Spinning Mills (P) Ltd.  2010 (2) SCALE 427 pointed out that court examines a document from different perspectives in different types of cases.	None
This Court observed In this context, it is necessary to remember that the nature of examination of a document may differ with reference to the context in which it is examined.	None
If a document is examined to find out whether adequate stamp duty has been paid under the Stamp Act, it will not be necessary to examine whether it is validly executed or whether it is fraudulent or forged.	None
On the other hand, if a document is being examined in a criminal case in the context of whether an offence of forgery has been committed, the question for examination will be whether it is forged or fraudulent, and the issue of stamp duty or registration will be irrelevant.	None
But if the document is sought to be produced and relied upon in a civil suit, in addition to the question whether it is genuine, or forged, the question whether it is compulsorily registrable or not, and the question whether it bears the proper stamp duty, will become relevant.	None
If the document is examined in the context of a dispute between the parties to the document, the nature of examination will be to find out that rights and obligation of one party visvis the other party.	None
If in a summary proceedings by a consumer against a service provider, the insurer is added as a cocomplainant or if the insurer represents the consumer as a power of attorney, there is no need to examine the nature of rights interse between the consumer and his insurer.	None
The scope of examination of the agreement dated 24.2.2006, by the learned Chief Justice or his Designate under section 11(6) is necessarily to be restricted to the question whether there is an arbitration agreement between the parties.	Issue
The examination cannot extend to examining the agreement to ascertain the rights and obligations regarding performance of such contract between the parties.	Reasoning
This Court in SBP Co. v. Patel Engineering Limited 2005 (8) SCC 618 and in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara Polyfab Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. 2009 (1) SCC 267 has held that when an application is filed under section 11, the Chief Justice or his Designate is required to decide only two issues, that is whether the party making the application has approached the appropriate court and whether there is an arbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied under section 11 of the Act, is a party to such agreement.	Reasoning
Therefore, the Chief Justice exercising jurisdiction under section 11 of the Act has to only consider whether there is an arbitration agreement between the petitioner and the respondent s in the application under section 11 of the Act.	Reasoning
Any wider examination in such a summary proceeding will not be warranted.20.	Reasoning
In so far as the issue of existence of arbitration agreement between the parties, the learned Chief Justice or his Designate is required to decide the issue finally and it is not permissible in a proceeding under section 11 to merely hold that a party is prima facie a party to the arbitration agreement and that a party is prima facie bound by it.	Reasoning
It is not as if the Chief Justice or his Designate will subsequently be passing any other final decision as to who are the parties to the arbitration agreement.	Reasoning
Once a decision is rendered by the Chief Justice or his Designate under section 11 of the Act, holding that there is an arbitration agreement between the parties, it will not be permissible for the arbitrator to consider or examine the same issue and record a finding contrary to the finding recorded by the court.	Reasoning
This is categorically laid down by the Constitution Bench in SBP.	Reasoning
Therefore the prima facie finding by the learned Chief Justice that Indowind is a party to the arbitration agreement is not what is contemplated by the Act.21	Reasoning
It is no doubt true that if Indowind had acknowledged or confirmed in any correspondence or other agreement or document, that it is a party to the arbitration agreement dated 24.2.2006 or that it is bound by the arbitration agreement contained therein, it could have been possible to say that Indowind is a party to the arbitration agreement.	Reasoning
But that would not be under section 7(4)(a)	Reasoning
but under section 7(4)(b) or section 7(5).	Reasoning
Be that as it may.	Reasoning
That is not the case of Wescare.	Reasoning
In fact, the delivery notes invoices issued by Wescare do not refer to the agreement dated 24.2.2006.	Reasoning
Nor does any letter or correspondence sent by Indowind refers to the agreement dated 24.2.2006, either as an agreement executed by it or as an agreement binding on it.	Reasoning
We may now refer to the several documents referred to and relied on by Wescare.22.	Reasoning
The first is in regard to the sale of WEGs by Wescare to Indowind.	Reasoning
The letter dated 15.3.2006 enclosing the invoice, the delivery notes dated 15.3.2006 given by Wescare to Indowind, the confirmation dated 15.3.2006 by Wescare to Indowind relating to the sale of WEGs, relied on by Wescare, very significantly do not refer to the agreement dated 24.2.2006.	Reasoning
They are straight and simple delivery notes and an invoice in regard to the sale of goods.	Reasoning
They can be independent transactions which do not depend on or relate to the agreement dated 24.2.2006.	Reasoning
If they were with reference to the agreement dated 24.2.2006, it is strange that Wescare did not choose to refer to the said agreement in any of these documents.23.	Reasoning
Strong reliance is placed on the Red Herring Prospectus issued by the Indowind in connection with the public issue of its shares.	Reasoning
We extract below the relied upon portions of the prospectus We have agreed to takeover the assets of Wescare (India) Limited, subject to approval of owners of assets and statutory formalities, but only a portion of acquisition has been completed.	None
Our Company agreed to takeover wind mills along with land, infrastructure and spares from Wescare India Limited.	None
But due to non receipt of approvals from the lenders lessors, only a part of the total being 6.49 MW has been acquired by us.	None
The Company is not certain of completing the remaining acquisition.	None
We had paid the total amount for 39 windmills, however only 28 windmills were delivered to us representing nearly 72 of the total money paid by us.	None
One of our Promoters, Subuthi Finance Limited, has entered into an agreement dated February 24, 2006 with Wescare (India) Limited for the acquiring wind mills and other assets in the name of its nominee viz.	None
Indowind Energy Limited for a consideration aggregating approximately Rs.9819 lacs.	None
The consideration for the above was to be partly settled in partly in cash (Rs.2419 lacs) and partly by way of shares (74 lacs) of Indowind Energy Limited.	None
Wescare (India) Limited has filed the following applications before the Honble High Court of Madras under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 No. Application No.	None
Applicant Respondents 1 O.A.No.641 of 2007 Wescare India (i) Subuthi Finance Limited Limited Indowind Energy Limited 2 O.A.No.642 of 2007 same as above same as above 3 Appl.	None
No.3808 of 2007 same as above same as above 4 Appl.	None
No.3808 of 2007 same as above same as above All above applications are pending before the Honble High Court of Madras.	None
For further details of the same, please refer section titled Outstanding Litigations and Material Developments on page 190 of this Red Herring Prospectus.	None
Para 30 of the Prospectus merely refers to Indowind agreeing to take over the wind mills along with land, infrastructure and spares from Wescare.	None
It does not refer to the agreement dated 24.2.2006 nor does it state that the takeover of the wind mills etc., was in pursuance of the agreement dated 24.2.2006.	Reasoning
Para 31 of the Prospectus specifically states that Subuthi had entered into an agreement dated 24.2.2006 with Wescare to acquire WEGs and other assets in the name of its nominee Indowind.	Reasoning
This has never been disputed by anyone.	Reasoning
But what is significant is that there is no acknowledgement or statement that the said agreement was authorized to be entered on its behalf by Indowind or Indowind had ratified or approved the said agreement.	Reasoning
Para 31 also refers to the applications under section 9 filed by Wescare and the interlocutory applications filed in such applications.	Reasoning
But then that also does not help as in fact in the said application under section 9 the High Court has held that Indowind is not a party to the agreement dated 24.2.2006 and therefore not a party to an arbitration agreement.24.	Reasoning
Wescare relied upon two decisions of the US Court of Appeals to contend that a person to be bound by an arbitration agreement need not personally sign the written arbitration agreement.	Reasoning
FISSER v. International Bank  282 F.2d 231 (1960) and J.J.Ryan Sons, Inc. v. Rhone Poulene Textile, S.A.  863 F.2d 315.	Reasoning
These decisions are of no assistance as they do not relate to a provision similar to section 7 of the Indian Act.	Reasoning
In view of the above, we allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court appointing an Arbitrator in regard to the claims of Wescare against Indowind and dismiss the application under section 11(6) of the Act filed by Wescare in so far as Indowind is concerned.	Decision
The appointment of Arbitrator in so far as Subuthi is concerned, is not disturbed.	Decision
It is however open to Subuthi to raise all contentions including the contention relating to absence of arbitral dispute, before the Arbitrator.	Decision
