However, an industrial dispute was raised in the following terms Whether the lock out effected by the management w.e.f. 14.1.1992 is justified?	None
If not, what relief the workers are entitled for?	None
The said industrial dispute was referred to for adjudication by the appropriate government before the Industrial Court, Nashik.	None
Appellant herein in its written statement inter alia raised the question as regards maintainability of the said reference relying on or on the basis of the said settlement dated 24.5.1993 stating The reference is not tenable and maintainable as there was no dispute in existence after the settlement dated 24.5.1993 arrived between Nashik Workers Union and the Company, Hindustan Fasteners Pvt. Ltd., hence the reference is immature in the eyes of law4.	Facts
The reference is also not maintainable in view of the settlement dated 24.5.1993 as per the Clause No. 20 of the said settlement.	Facts
It was full and final settlement and all the demands were settled.	Facts
It was also made clear that all other demands and claims were relinquished by the workmen and the Union and as such the reference is to be rejected It was further stated The Employer Company welcome any investigation that the Honble Tribunal may undertake, since it would definitely conclude that the lockout was justified and its prolongation was due to the illegal tactics of the Nashik Workers Union.	None
A dispute, thus, existed between the parties as regards applicability of the said settlement to the reference.7.	Facts
The Tribunal made an award in the said reference on 19.1.2001 stating I have gone through the said settlement but the said settlement nowhere makes any reference regarding the wages to be paid to the workers for lock out period.	Facts
But the said settlement is regarding other demands.	Facts
If the issue regarding the payment of lock out period would have been discussed between the parties then, certainly the said issue could have been mentioned in the settlement.	Facts
It is further the contention of the company that in view of the Clause 20 of the settlement all the demands between the parties were settled The Tribunal in its award further stated After perusal of the Clause 20 referred above it makes clear the demand should be raised which will directly involve financial burden on the company, but it is permanent to note here that no such demand is raised by the Union, on the contrary, the present reference is referred by the Government in view of P.A.M.S. proceeding pending before the Dy. Commissioner of Labour prior to signing the said settlement.	Facts
The company as well as the Second Party workers both were aware about P.A.M.S. proceedings pending before the Dy. Commissioner of Labour regarding the lock out.	Facts
Therefore, they ought to have been mentioned the same in the present settlement so as to resolve the dispute.	Facts
But, as the said issue is not taken into the present settlement referred above by stretch of imagination could not be said that the said issue was settled finally in view of settlement dated 24.5.1993 signed between the parties.	Facts
Therefore, the contention of First Party Company that present reference is not maintainable could not be accepted.	Facts
Hence, I answer the issue in the negative.	Facts
It was further found that although Appellant sought to justify the lock out declared by it but in support of the said plea, no witness was examined on its behalf.	Facts
In the aforementioned premise, by reason of the said award, the Industrial Tribunal directed The lock out declared by the Company w.e.f. 14.1.1992 is unjustified.3.	Facts
The workers are entitled for the wages for lock out for period from 14.1.1992 to 2.6.1993.4.	Facts
The First Party Company is directed to pay the wages to the concerned workers in the period of 14.1.1992 to 2.6.1993 within two months from the date of the publication of the Award.	Facts
A writ petition was filed there against.	Facts
A learned Single Judge of the High Court in its judgment dated 23.04.2002 noticed the contentions of Appellant herein that when the settlement was arrived at, reference had already been made by the appropriate authority.	Facts
However, it was opined that the said settlement did not contain any provision as to whether the workmen had given up their rights of wages during the period the factory was under lockout.	Facts
The writ petition was dismissed.	Facts
An intracourt appeal filed thereagainst by Appellant was also dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment stating that under the aforementioned settlement the workmen had not given up their rights of wages.10.	Facts
Mr. Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant, raised a short contention in support of this appeal.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that the settlement was to be read in its entirety.	Arguments of Petitioner
So read, the learned counsel would contend, it would be apparent that all disputes and differences between the parties and all demands raised by reason of the Charter of Demands dated 1.01.1993 and all other demands having been resolved, the question of directing payment of any wages during the period for which the factory was under lockout did not and could not arise.11.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent, on the other hand, would submit that the Charter of Demands was in relation to the specific issues as, for example, bonus, festival allowance, pay scale, etc.12.	Arguments of Respondent
The purport and object of a settlement arrived at by and between the management and the workmen is undisputedly required to be construed keeping in view its salutary effect.	None
It is aimed at maintenance of industrial peace and harmony.	None
A settlement, therefore, although is required to be read for upholding the validity thereof like any other agreement, it should be read in its entirety so as to ascertain the intention of the parties behind the same.	None
It is true that in the said settlement, not only the Charter of Demands served on the management on or about 1.01.1993 was referred to, but the exchange of letters between the parties had also been referred to, but the intention of the parties is to be gathered having regard to the circumstances attending thereto.	None
There had been a lockout and a protracted court proceeding.	None
A long term solution was to be found out.	None
The settlement was in relation to the purported causes of the lockout.	None
It was still continuing.	None
A Charter of Demands of the Union was served on behalf of the workmen.	None
It did not relate to wages of the workmen during the period of lockout.	None
Clause 20 of the said settlement must, therefore, be read keeping in view the aforementioned backdrop of events.	None
But, before we embark upon the said question, we may notice the Charter of Demands dated 1.01.1993.	None
The demands of workmen referred to pay scale, classification, dearness allowance, leave, various allowances including travelling allowance, washing allowance and various other allowances as specified therein e.g., uniform, festival advance, etc.	None
Correspondences entered into by and between the parties were in relation to the aforementioned demands.	Reasoning
It did not speak of the claim of wages, although when the settlement was arrived at, the industrial dispute was pending.15.	Reasoning
Had, thus, the intention of the parties been to settle their disputes also in relation to legality or otherwise of the lockout declared by the management, it was expected to have been stated so explicitly therein.	Reasoning
It was also expected that the parties would file the said settlement before the Industrial Tribunal so that an award could be passed in terms thereof.	Reasoning
Clause 20 of the said settlement provides for a package deal visvis all the demands raised by the Union.	Reasoning
The package deal was in relation to the Charter of Demands dated 1.01.1993 and any other document including the letters exchanged between the parties pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof.	Reasoning
The subject matter of settlement was all demands of whatever nature in terms whereof the workmen might not have been able to make any other demand, but, on a bare perusal of the said settlement, it is apparent that the expression which has repeatedly been used was the Charter of Demands.16.	Reasoning
While keeping the industrial dispute pending, Respondents had not raised any fresh demand.17.	Reasoning
Clause 21 refers to the previous settlement also.	Reasoning
The rights of the workmen under the existing settlement were not adversely affected.	Reasoning
If they have worked, they would be entitled to wages.	Reasoning
If they have reported for duties during the period of lockout which was illegal, they were entitled to the wages for the said period.18.	Reasoning
In furtherance of the said Charter of Demands, the parties entered into several other correspondences.	Reasoning
In terms of the settlement, the parties settled their disputes in relation to the demands raised.	Reasoning
The wages to be paid to the workmen which they had claimed as of right was not and could not have been the subject matter of any payment or settlement.	Reasoning
Whereas the concept of a demand must be held to be relating to a right higher than the existing right, the workmen were entitled to raise a claim in relation to their existing right and in that view of the matter financial implication therefor cannot be a ground for refusal thereof.	Reasoning
If a claim is to be withdrawn by reason of a settlement, the same must find a specific mention therein.19.	Reasoning
Subject, of course, to the parties acting on the settlement, the workmen had promised that they would not go for work stoppage or go slow but then in terms of Paragraph 12 of Clause 23 of the said settlement, it had categorically been reiterated that the expression wages shall be given the same meaning as obtaining in the statute.	Reasoning
The right to enforce the claim for wages both in the first settlement as also the second settlement was, therefore, not given up.	Reasoning
It was further stated that no additional claims would be made for increase of benefits.	Reasoning
Paragraph 13 of Clause 23 of the said settlement also refers to existing rights and obligations subject, of course, to the modification made therein.	Reasoning
By reason of the said settlement, the workmen surrendered their rights of bonus.	Reasoning
We have noticed hereinbefore that the management, although questioned the legality and or validity of the reference, but at the same time also welcomed the same stating that thereby they had got an opportunity to establish that the lockout declared by them was not illegal.	Reasoning
But, then no witness was examined to prove the said fact.20.	Reasoning
The parties, therefore, made it clear that the claim of wages raised on behalf of the workmen on the premise that the lockout was illegal was not the subject matter of the settlement.	Reasoning
The Tribunal, in our opinion, is right in arriving at the finding that the intention of the parties must be gathered from the attending circumstances one of them being that although the parties were aware that the industrial dispute was pending but no reference thereto was made in the settlement.	Reasoning
It is difficult to accept the contention of Mr. Naphade that in the facts and circumstances of this case, provisions of Section 92 of the Evidence Act would have any role to play.	None
It is not the contention of Respondents that the settlement was not to be read as a full or final settlement between the parties but the same must be read as meaning that the settlement was only in respect of the Charter of Demands and other demands made by the Union from time to time in its various letters.	None
Construction of a document so as to ascertain the intention of the parties is in no way controlled by the provisions of Sections 91 or 92 of the Evidence Act.	None
The document has to be interpreted applying the known principles of construction and or canons.	None
In fact, in the special leave petition, Appellant itself has contended (VI) That because the Honble High Court should have appreciated the fact that at the time of reference the contesting parties were negotiating the Settlement.	None
So in view thereof it was the duty of the Conciliation Officer under Section 12(2) and 12(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act for bringing about a settlement of the dispute without delay and investigate the dispute and all such matters affecting the merits and the settlement thereof.	None
Further, it is pertinent to state that the Conciliation Officer has enough powers to investigate the cause of dispute and enforce a settlement.	None
If that was the stand of Appellant before the Conciliation Officer, they could have asked him to close the conciliation proceedings.	None
They did not do so.	None
Applying the principles of interpretation of a document and having regard to the circumstances attending thereto, we are of the opinion that the findings of the tribunal and the High Court cannot be faulted with.	Reasoning
For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in this appeal which is dismissed accordingly with costs.	Decision
