Shri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submits that the appellants were fully eligible for allotment of land.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submits that the allotment of land has to be treated as allotment made on 07.06.1997 on the basis of which Letter of Intent dated 05.11.1998 was issued.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submits that the appellants were eligible on the date of Resolution dated 07.06.1997 as well as on 05.11.1998 they being in service on the above relevant dates they could not be held to be not eligible relying on the date 11.12.2003 on which date letter was issued on the basis of Resolution 01.09.2003.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submits that subsequent Resolution dated 01.09.2003 was in continuation and in modification of earlier Resolution dated 07.06.1997, hence, the eligibility has to be seen on the date when Resolution dated 07.06.1997 was passed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants being eligible on the original date when the Resolution was passed, the view taken by respondent No.1 that they are not eligible for allotment was erroneous.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that the appellants being members of the Society and eligible for allotment, they will not lose the eligibility merely on the ground that a subsequent Resolution dated 01.09.2003 was passed.	Arguments of Petitioner
8He submits that the view of the High Court that the allotment was made on the basis of a fresh proposal made by the Society, is incorrect.	Arguments of Petitioner
The allotment is consequent to earlier proposal which culminated into the Resolution dated 07.06.1997. 8.	None
Shri Shivaji M. Jadhav, learned counsel appearing for the respondent refuting the submissions made by the appellants contends that a fresh allotment was made on 01.09.2003 on the basis of Government Resolution dated 09.07.1999 which is separate allotment having no relation to the earlier Resolution dated 07.06.1997.	Arguments of Respondent
He submits that the appellants being not in service of the Authority on the date when Letter of Intent was issued i.e. 11.12.2003, they have rightly been excluded from the list of eligible members.	Arguments of Respondent
He submits that the High Court has taken correct view of the matter.	Arguments of Respondent
9.	None
We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.	None
10.	None
The High Court has dismissed the writ petition taking the view that allotment dated 01.09.2003 was passed on 9the fresh proposal submitted by the Society and the Resolution dated 01.09.2003 being passed on separate and distinct proposal, eligibility on 07.06.1997 is not relevant.	Issue
Whether the above reason given by the High Court for dismissing the writ petition is correct or not is the first issue which needs to be answered in this case.	Issue
11.	None
In pursuance of Resolution dated 07.06.1997 Letter of Intent dated 05.11.1998 was issued in which following terms were mentioned for allotment of land1.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Association of employees will form the proposed Cooperative Housing Society of the Employees within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of Authoritys letter and to get the said Society registered within a period of 6 months.2.	None

The provision of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (Disposal of Land) Regulations will be applicable to this allotment of land.12.	None
The letter dated 05.11.1998 refers to Disposal of Land Regulations.	Reasoning
At this juncture, we may notice the above Regulations which were amended on 29.04.1997.	Reasoning
The amended Regulation, 1997 has been brought on the record by the appellants themselves through rejoinderaffidavit.	Reasoning
In the Amendment Regulation Clause (iA) has been added which is to the following effect (iA) If half of the premium shall not be paid within one month or in case of Government within two months, if permitted by the Metropolitan Commissioner, the Agreement concluded with the Authority shall stand determined and the Earnest Money deposited by Intending Lessee along with its tender or offer shall stand forfeited to the Authority without prejudice to the rights and powers of Authority to recover compensation for loss or damage, if any suffered in consequence of such breach of the Intending Lessee to so pay half of the premium to the Authority.	Reasoning
Likewise, if the balance premium shall not be paid within twelve months as provided hereto before, the Agreement concluded with the Authority shall stand determined and the Earnest Money paid by him along with its tender or offer together with 25 per cent of the premium shall be forfeited to the Authority without prejudice to the right and powers of the Authority to recover compensation for loss or damage, if any, suffered in consequence of such default of the Intending Lessee.	Reasoning
13.	None
The Disposal of Land Regulations as amended being applicable, it was required for the Society to make payment of premium within the time prescribed by the Authority.	None
Admittedly, the Society did not make the payment of premium and has submitted a request for permitting to make payment by instalments spread over 10 to 15 years.	None
It was further prayed that the land falling under road and compulsory open spaces will be made available free of cost.	None
The Society requested for relaxation of various conditions which were not granted by the Authority at any point of time.	None
The Resolution dated 07.06.1997 and consequent allotment dated 05.11.1998 did not fructify into allotment of land and lapsed as per Disposal of Land Regulations as amended in 1997, Regulation (iA).	None
In the meantime the Government of Maharashtra has issued Resolution dated 09.07.1999 providing various terms and conditions for allotment.	None
In the present case, we are concerned with one of the conditions which is condition No.8 of AnnexureA. AnnexureA is Eligibility for approval to the members of the Cooperative Housing Societies who intend to obtain Government land by paying concessional occupancy charges lease rent.	None
Condition No.8 which is a part of AnnexureA to the Resolution is to the following effect 8.	None
It is a pre requisite that the Government Employee will be in the service on the date on which the indent letter will be issued to the Cooperative Housing Society, and only then such employee will be treated as eligible for membership.	None
14.	None
The Society itself has made various applications to the Authority after Resolution dated 07.06.1997.	None
One of the applications dated 09.12.1999 is Annexure P5 where the allotment on certain modified terms and conditions was prayed for, which was never granted.	None

It is useful to quote the prayer made in paragraph 4 of the aforesaid letter 4.	None
You are now requested to put up a proposal for the consideration of the Authority in its forthcoming meeting for the allotment of earmarked MMRDA land at Chitalsar Manpada to the MMRDA Employees Cooperative Housing Society, Chitalsar Manpuda,Thane in accordance with the Government of Maharashtra Resolution No. LCA1095/P.K.37/95/J1 (together with its Annexures) dated 9th July, 1999 as was approved by the Authority for the allotment of land to the MMRDA ClassIV Employees Cooperative Housing Society at Panchpakhadi.

area on the terms prescribed in the above referred Government of Maharashtra Resolution.	None
Thanking you, Yours faithfully, (A.V. Ghangurde) Chairman.	None
16.	None
In response to letter dated 27.04.2001, the Authority wrote a letter dated 03.05.2001 to the Society forwarding the Resolution dated 09.07.1999 and requesting the Society to go through the terms and conditions and communicate Societys willingness so that further action be taken.	Reasoning
The Society vide letter dated 10.05.2001 communicated its willingness to abide by the Resolution dated 09.07.1999 and thereafter	Reasoning
Resolution dated 01.09.2003 was passed for allotment of land.	Reasoning
In pursuance of Resolution dated 01.09.2003, letter dated 11.12.2003 was issued by the Authority to the Society.	Reasoning
The Authority vide letter dated 11.12.2003 informed that lease premium may be charged at Rs.2500/ per sq.mtr.	Reasoning
instead of Rs.1400/ per sq. mtr.	Reasoning
as was earlier approved.	Reasoning
From the aforesaid sequence of events, it is clear that the allotment dated 01.09.2003 was a fresh allotment of land on a higher premium that is Rs.2500/ per sqr. mtr.	Reasoning
Earlier allotment dated 07.06.1997 had lapsed due to non fulfilment of the conditions as required by the Disposal of Land Regulations, 1977 as noted above.	Reasoning
Thus, the allotment dated 01.09.2003 was on the basis of the fresh proposal relying on the Government of Maharashtra Resolution dated 09.07.1999.	Reasoning
We, thus, are of the view that the High Court is right in its conclusion that allotment dated 01.09.2003 was on the basis of fresh proposal of the Society and same has no nexus with respect to Resolution dated 07.06.1997. 17.	Reasoning
Learned counsel for the appellants relying on Resolution dated 01.09.2003 submits that the Resolution dated 01.09.2003 clearly mentions that it modifies condition No.3 contained in earlier Resolution dated 07.06.1997 which clearly means that Resolution dated 01.09.2003 is in continuation of earlier Resolution, hence, the eligibility of the members have to be seen on 07.06.1997 or 05.11.1998.	Arguments of Petitioner
He relies on the following portion of Resolution dated 01.09.2003 RESOLVED THAT, in exercise of power conferred under SubSection 2 of Section 3 of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority Act, 1974 and making modification in Condition No.c contained in its resolution dated 727 passed in the 88 th meeting held on 7.6.1997 and as proposed in paragraph 6 of the item note, the authority allots the land situated at Chitalhar, Manpada, Thane to the MMRDA employees cooperative housing society on the following terms and conditions.	Arguments of Petitioner
18.	None
It is true that Resolution dated 01.09.2003 modifies condition No.(c) as was contained in Resolution 07.06.1997.	None
Condition No.(c) was with regard to amount of premium per sq.mtr.	Reasoning
which was Rs.1400/. The Resolution dated 01.09.2003	Reasoning
modifies the said amount as Rs.2500/ per sq. mtr.	Reasoning
The modification of above condition has been specifically mentioned since earlier the Authority has offered the plot on Rs.1400/ per sq. mtr.	Reasoning
which was subsequently made as Rs.2500/ per sq.mtr.	Reasoning
As noted above the Resolution dated 07.06.1997 itself was not honoured by the Society and it lapsed as per statutory Regulations noted above.	Reasoning
19.	None
The fresh allotment was made on 01.09.2003 in pursuance of which Letter of Intent was issued on 11.12.2003, thus, the eligibility has to be seen as per condition of AnnexureA of the Government Resolution dated 09.07.1999.	Reasoning
On the strength of Resolution dated 01.09.2003 in so far as it modifies the rate of premium per sq.mtr., it cannot be said that the same allotment which was made on 07.06.1997 has been continued on 01.09.2003 and the eligibility of members has to be pegged on the date of Resolution dated 07.06.1997 or 05.11.1998 i.e. issue of Letter of Intent.	Reasoning
We, thus, do not find any substance in the above submission of the learned counsel of the appellants.	Reasoning
20.	None
The submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that eligibility with regard to being in service has to be seen on the date 07.06.1997 or 05.11.1998, thus, cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
The Society itself has given approval vide its communication dated 10.05.2001 to consider the allotment to the Society in its forthcoming meeting on 17.05.2001 on the basis of Government of Maharashtra Resolution dated 09.07.1999.	Reasoning
It is thus clear that the Society itself has requested for a fresh consideration and fresh Resolution on the basis of the eligibility laid down by Resolution 09.07.1999.	Reasoning
After after issuance of allotment letter dated 11.12.2003 by which list of eligible members was asked for, in response to which Society has sent its communication dated 10.06.2004 stating the following The final list of members eligible as on 11.12.2003 by scrutiny of said list as per terms and conditions under the Government Resolution through the Land Branch will be accepted to the Society.	Reasoning
Also, the waiting list of total 33 members has been present till date through the Society and it will be sent to the Land Branch at the necessary time.	Reasoning
21.	None
Thus, the Society was conscious of the fact that eligibility of members has to be seen as on 11.12.2003 that is the date on which Letter of Intent was issued in pursuance of allotment.	Reasoning
The Society having accepted the aforesaid clause of eligibility and accepted the offer of allotment as given by the Authority, we fail to see that how the eligibility as on 11.12.2003 be permitted to be questioned.	Reasoning
22.	None
There is one more fact which needs to be noted.	Facts
The Authority has proposed allotment of 13,700 sq.mtr of land which is apparent from its Resolution dated 01.09.2003 as well as letter dated 11.12.2003.	Facts
After scrutinising the list of eligibility, ultimately, the allotment was made only for land admeasuring 10,700 sq.mtr.	None
by letter dated 09.12.2005.	Reasoning
The Authority had not taken into consideration the area for noneligible members while finalising the list and due to the aforesaid reasons the area allotted to the Society has been reduced from 13,700 sq.mtr.	Reasoning
To 10,700 sq.mtr.	Reasoning
23.	None
Taking into consideration the aforesaid facts and circumstances, we are of the view that no relief can be granted to the appellants.	Decision
The High Court did not commit any error in dismissing the writ petition.	Decision
We do not find any infirmity in the judgment of the High Court.	Decision
The appeal is dismissed.	Decision
