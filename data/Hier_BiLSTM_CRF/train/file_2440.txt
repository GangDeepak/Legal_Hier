 Civil Appeal Nos. 2330 of 2000, 3572 of 2000, 76 of 2002 and S.L.P. (C)	None
No. 22549 of 2001 N. Kirpal, C.J.I. Leave granted.	None
These appeals are against orders passed by the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (hereinafter referred to as the MRTP Commission) whereby Indonesian manufacturers of float glass had been restrained from exporting the same to India at allegedly predatory prices.	None
Respondent No. 1 is an association of float glass manufacturers in India.	Facts
During MarchApril, 1998, complaints were made by the said respondent to the Customs Department, alleging that the Indonesian manufacturers of float glass, in association with Indian importers were allegedly indulging in heavy underinvoicing.	Facts
The respondents were, however, informed by the Customs Department in Calcutta that if they had any genuine grievance, the same could be made before the Designated Authority, Ministry of Commerce dealing with antidumping complaints.	Facts
On 26th May, 1998, the respondent No. 1 presented a complaint before the Designated Authority.	Facts
This complaint appears to have been filed before the AntiDumping Authority and the same was possibly not pursued by the complainant.3.	Facts
On 10th September,1998, the respondent No. 1 filed a complaint before the MRTP Commission under Section 33(1)(j), (ja) and Section 36A read with Section 2(o) of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (hereinafter referred to as the MRTP Act) against three Indonesian companies alleging that they were manufacturing float glass and were selling the same at predatory prices in India, and were hence resorting to restrictive and unfair trade practices.	Facts
In the complaint, it was stated that the float glass of Indonesian origin was being exported into India at the CIF price of US 155 to 180 PMT.	Facts
At this price, some float glass had been shipped into India during the period December, 1997, to June, 1998.	Facts
It was alleged that these sale prices were predatory prices as they were less than not only the cost of production for the product in Indonesia but also the variable cost of production of the product.	Facts
The complainant gave figures indicating the estimated cost of float glass internationally as well as the cost of production of float glass in India with a view to demonstrate that the Indian manufacturers of float glass would not be able to compete with the price at which the Indonesian manufacturers were presently selling or intending to sell to Indian consumers.	Facts
On this basis, it was contended that the sale of float glass by the Indonesian manufacturers at the said price of US 155 to 180 PMT will restrict, distort and prevent competition by pricing out Indian producers from the market.	Facts
This would result in lowering the production of the Indian industry and the consequent idle capacity and losses would force the industry to become sick which would lead to its closure which would have a direct impact on the employment in the industry.4.	Facts
In response to the notice issued to the Indonesian companies, M s. P.T. Mulia Industries (respondent No. 2 in this appeal) wrote a letter to the MRTP Commission stating that it had never in the past exported float glass to India.	Facts
The other two respondents did not send any reply to the Commission.	Facts
The appellant, however, which is the Indian importer of the float glass from Indonesia had filed a caveat before the Commission.	Facts
It also filed a reply refuting the allegations of the respondent and it was the contention of the appellant that respondent No. 1 was a cartel of Indian manufacturers of float glass which was, in fact, exporting out of India at prices far lower than their own cost of production in India.	Facts
It was also contended by the appellant herein that the cost of production of float glass was lower in Indonesia than in India and float glass was not being exported to India at predatory prices.5.	Facts
The application under Section 12A for interim injunction was heard by the Chairman of the Commission and a second Member.	Facts
There was a difference of opinion amongst them.	Facts
While the Chairman vide order dated 18th January, 1999, allowed the application and restrained the Indonesian companies from exporting to India their float glass production at predatory prices, Dr. S. Chakravarthy, the second member dismissed the application, inter alia, holding that there was no evidence to substantiate the plea of predatory pricing at this stage.	Facts
By order dated 9th February, 2000, the third member who heard the case concurred with the view taken by the Chairman and passed an order of injunction against the Indonesian companies.6.	Facts
While Civil Appeal No. 2330 of 2000 is filed by the Indian importer who was the caveator before the Commission, Civil Appeal No. 3572 of 2000 has been filed by P.T. Muliaglass which is the subsidiary of P.T. Mulia Industrindo.	Facts
It is the case of P.T. Muliaglass that the holding company does not carry out any manufacturing operations and that is why it had informed the MRTP Commission that it was not engaged in the export of float glass to India and, therefore, it did not appear before the MRTP Commission.	Facts
P.T. Mulia Glass which, in fact, manufacturers the float glass being aggrieved by the order of the MRTP Commission has filed the appeal, inter alia, contending that it is not exporting float glass to India at predatory prices.	Facts
On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that the MRTP Commission had no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the complaint which was made by the respondents.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that the essence of the complaint of the respondents before the MRTP Commission was of injury to the domestic industry on account of low prices by the Indonesian manufacturers which is a dispute under AntiDumping law and does not fall within the jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that the complaint which was made against the Indonesian exporters was one essentially of dumping as it had been contended that the Indonesian exporters were exporting float glass at very low prices which were predatory in nature and the intention was to cause injury to the domestic industry.8.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that Article 18.1 of the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the GATT, 1994, provides that no specific action against dumping of exports from another member can be taken except in accordance with the provisions of GATT, 1994 as interpreted by this agreement.	Arguments of Petitioner
The remedy against the practice of dumping export of goods at predatory prices has been expressly agreed upon internationally under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to which India is a signatory.	None
The agreement deals with antidumping duties and provides mechanism to implement.	Arguments of Petitioner
In pursuance of the GATT, 1994, the Parliament for the first time inserted provisions 9A to 9C in the Customs Tariff Act vide the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Act, 1995, No. 6 of 1995 which replaced the provisions of Sections 9, 9A and 9B earlier inserted in the Customs Tariff Act under Act No. 52 of 1982.	None
The Statement of Objects and Reasons to the Bill clearly states that the Bill seeks to amend the Custom Tariff Act to bring the provisions of the Custom Tariff Act in conformity with the provisions of Article VI of the GATT, 1994, and the agreements on subsidies and countervailing measures.	None
Even the preamble of the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Act, 1995, No. 6 of 1995 also provides that the provisions of Sections 9, 9A and 9B of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, have been replaced by the new Sections 9, 9A and 9B to reflect the changes in the domestic law, consequent upon coming into effect the agreement on Antidumping (i.e. an agreement on implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994) under the Uruguay Round on 1st January, 1995.	None
Section 9A, inter alia, provides that where any article is exported from any country or territory to India at less than its normal value, then, upon the importation of such article into India, the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, impose an antidumping duty not exceeding the margin of dumping in relation to such article.	None
The said section indicates how the normal value and the margin of dumping is to be ascertained.	None
Section 9B contains provisions which provide for exemption from levy under Section 9 or Section 9A in certain cases while Section 9C gives the right of appeal against the order of determination or review thereof regarding the existence, degree and effect of any subsidy or dumping in relation to import of any article.	None
The Act contemplates the Designated Authority, which is appointed under its provisions, to conduct a detailed investigation into the allegation of dumping of articles before it determines the normal value, export price and the margin of dumping.	None
It is important to note that in undertaking this exercise, the Government or the foreign country exporting the article is required to be informed.	None
By notification dated 1st January, 1995, AntiDumping Duty Rules were framed.	None
Rule 14 sets out circumstances under which the Designated Authority may terminate in investigation.	None
In Rule 14(d), there is a deminimus requirement that is to say the volume of the dumped imports, actual or potential, should account for not less than 3 of the imports of the like product.	None
If the imports are below this level, the authority shall terminate the investigation immediately.	None
It is the case of the appellant that the float glass which was imported from Indonesia was much less than 3.	None
The learned Counsel for the appellants contended that the respondents have in the complaint filed by them with the MRTP Commission under the MRTP Act sought redressal of their alleged grievance that certain Indonesian companies are selling float glass at prices much lower than their cost of production and are thereby allegedly indulging in predatory pricing with an alleged intent to eliminate competition and causing material injury to the interest of domestic float glass industry.	Arguments of Petitioner
For redressal of the alleged grievance of the respondents, a specific remedy has been provided under Sections 9A to 9C of the Customs Tariff Act and the AntiDumping Duty Rules.	Arguments of Petitioner
The provisions of Sections 9A to 9C introduced under the Customs Tariff Act and the AntiDumping Duty Rules provide for a complete and exhaustive machinery to prevent dumping of goods into India including export of goods into India at predatory price causing injury to domestic industry, causing threat of injury to domestic industry and material retardation to establishment of domestic industry by way of imposition of antidumping duty on import of such goods.	Arguments of Petitioner
The expression injury has been defined under Article 3 of the Agreement on AntiDumping as under Injury shall unless otherwise specified, be taken to mean material injury to a domestic industry threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishment of such an industry, and shall be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of this article.	None
Thus, it was submitted, the remedy for imposition of antidumping duty has been provided so as to prevent distortion, impairment and restriction of competition in domestic industry.	Arguments of Petitioner
A specific authority, i.e., the Designated Authority on Antidumping has been constituted under the AntiDumping Duty Rules framed under the Customs Tariff Act which has the powers to conduct investigation upon receipt of a complaint from the domestic industry or suo motu relating to dumping of goods by a foreign company to identify the existence, degree and effect of any alleged dumping in relation to import of any article and injury to domestic industry, threat of injury to domestic industry, material retardation to establishment of domestic industry, etc. and to recommend to the Central Government the amount of antidumping duty to remove the injury to the domestic industry, based on which the Central Government imposes provisional or final antidumping duty upon importation of the concerned goods into India as a result of which the cost for the Indian importer for the imported goods and the articles becomes the same as that of fair value of such goods and articles in the domestic market.	Arguments of Petitioner
The object of the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act and the AntiDumping Duty Rules is thus to prevent distortion, impairment and restriction of competition caused by export of goods to India at dumped predatory price.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of the aforesaid, the finding of the MRTP Commission that as the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act only provide for imposition of custom duties, they have had no relevance for overriding the provisions of the MRTP Act, is erroneous, was the submission.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also submitted that the object of the MRTP Act on the other hand generally is to check concentration of economic power to the common detriment, to control monopolies and to prohibit monopolistic and restrictive trade practices and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of the above, the MRTP Act and the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act cover the same subjectmatter as the scope and object of both the Acts is same although the MRTP Act is a general Act and the Customs Tariff Act is a special Act for the redressal of grievance of the respondents.13.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that where a particular subject has received special treatment under specific provisions statute, it will exclude the applicability of the general provision(s) which might otherwise cover the said topic.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, applying this wellsettled law, the general provisions of the MRTP Act will be excluded in relation to any grievance and complaint pertaining to dumping exporting of goods at predatory price from foreign country into India, with an intent to cause injury to the domestic industry which is specifically covered under the provisions of Sections 9A, 9B and 9C of the Customs Tariff Act and the AntiDumping Duty Rules framed there under.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, Sections 9A to 9C of the Customs Tariff Act exclude the jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission in such matters.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants rely on the following decisions of the Honble Supreme Court which unequivocally lays down and reiterates the above mentioned principle Belsund Sugar Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar and Others, VIII (1999)	None
SLT 164(1999) 9 SCC 620 at 638 and 639, 641, 648, 649 and 650.(ii)	None

On behalf of the respondents, it was submitted that the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975, relating to imposition of antidumping duties do not in any way oust the jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission over the restrictive trade practice of predatory pricing.	Arguments of Respondent
It was contended that the two statutes occupied different fields and were distinct in their scope and applicability.	Arguments of Respondent
There was no overlap or conflict between the statutes and hence the question of repeal, whether implied or express, did not arise.	Arguments of Respondent
The Customs Tariff Act is concerned with the imposition of duties of customs.	Arguments of Respondent
Imposition of customs duty is the policy decision of the Government in the realm of taxation.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 9A read with the rules provide for the determination of certain objective criteria on the basis of which the decision of the Central Government to levy antidumping duty can be based.	Arguments of Respondent
The Customs Tariff Act does not confer any right on any individual or association and does not provide for any remedy to them.	Arguments of Respondent
Only the domestic industry can approach the Designated Authority.15.	Arguments of Respondent
It was further contended that whereas predatory pricing enquiries are concerned with sales below the cost of production of the predator with the intention to eliminate competition, antidumping investigations are triggered when an exporter sells his products in the export market at a price below that of the price at which he sells his product in the country of origin.	Arguments of Respondent
In antidumping investigations, therefore, the focus is on sale price in the country of origin as posed to the cost of production.16.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the respondents, the MRTP Act provides for a judicial remedy for specified practices done individually or collectively.	Arguments of Respondent
An individual consumer or a trade association or a competitor can approach the MRTP Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
There is a right of appeal to the Supreme Court against the orders passed by the MRTP Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
Only domestic industry has the right to initiate antidumping proceedings.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus the scope and operation of the Acts mentioned above was different.	Arguments of Respondent
In particular, the ingredients of transactions which attract operation of the MRTP Act and the Customs Tariff Act are different and the question of one superseding in the other as a special law does not arise.	Arguments of Respondent
They operate in different fields and are subject to different considerations.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, in the absence of any conflict or overlap between the two statutes, the question of the Customs Tariff Act provisions impliedly repealing the provisions of Section 33(1)(j) of the MRTP Act do not arise, was the submission.17.	Arguments of Respondent
While adopting the arguments of the other Counsel, Mr. Anil B. Divan, Senior Advocate on behalf of the respondent No. 1 referred to Sections 2(e), 2(u), 13 and 14 of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that Section 2(u)(i) which defines trade practice covers a chain of events series of transactions that affect the price charged or methods of trading.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus a part of trade practice may be outside India but the affectation of prices may have effect in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, he submitted, the import of goods and the sale in India which is the last link of the trade practice of predatory pricing read with Section 14 clearly gives jurisdiction in an appropriate case to the MRTP Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
He contended that like the EEC as well as the USA, the law in India was the same, namely, that if the effect of a restrictive trade practice came to be felt in India because of a part of the trade practice being implemented in India, the MRTP Commission would have jurisdiction.	Arguments of Respondent
This effects doctrine was, therefore, sought to be invoked with a view to cloth the MRTP with jurisdiction to pass orders even though a transaction which resulted in exporting goods to India at predatory price, which was in effect a restrictive trade practice, had been carried outside the territory of India.	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that where the effect of restrictive trade practice carried out outside the territory of EEC or USA is felt within the EEC or USA, the authorities enforcing competition law in the EEC or the USA exercise jurisdiction in regard to such conduct.	Arguments of Respondent
He relied upon the decision of the European Court of Justice in the Wood Pulp case rendered on 27h September, 1988.	Arguments of Respondent
There while interpreting Article 85 of the EEC Treaty which prohibited any agreement, decision and concerted practice which have the effect of prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market, it was held that where producers established outside the EEC implement a pricing agreement within the common market the communitys jurisdiction to apply its competition rules to such conduct is covered by the territoriality principle and is not in breach of the principle of international comity.18.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted by Mr. Divan that even while a regime for imposition of antidumping duties has been present in the EEC right from 1968, it was never suggested before the European Commission or the European Court of Justice that its jurisdiction stood ousted or that the provisions of Article 85 stood impliedly repealed by the antidumping Code in respect of imports.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Divan also submitted that in the USA, the Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations issued by the U.S. Department of Justice enunciated that the State Department will exercise jurisdiction under the Sherman Act over foreign conduct which had direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effects on U.S. domestic or import commerce.	Arguments of Respondent
While adopting the arguments of the other Counsel, Mr. Anil Divan on behalf of the respondents, drew the Courts attention to Section 4 of the MRTP Act which reads as follows Application of other laws not barred.(1) Save as otherwise provided in Subsection (2) or elsewhere in this Act, the provisions of this Act, shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other law for the time being in force.(2)	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3 or elsewhere in this Act, so much of the provisions of this Act, as relate to matters in respect of which specific provisions exist in the(i) Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934), or the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949), or(ii) State Bank of India Act, 1955 (23 of 1955), or the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 (38 of 1959), or(iii) Insurance Act, 1938 (4 of 1938), shall not apply to a banking company, the State Bank of India or a subsidiary Bank, as defined in the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959 (38 of 1959), or an insurer, as the case may be.	None
He submitted that the provisions of the MRTP Act clearly postulated the continued applicability of other laws.	Arguments of Respondent
There was no specific provision in the MRTP Act which made any other law inapplicable and there was no reason why by a process of interpretation the Indian MRTP Act should be emasculated and a beneficiant antimonopoly jurisdiction exercised worldwide should be denied to the Indian MRTP Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
What is the scheme of the Act, insofar as it is relevant to the present case, relating to allegation of restrictive trade practice and the jurisdiction and power of the Commission in regard thereto.	Issue
As the preamble indicates the MRTP Act, inter alia, prohibits restrictive trade practices.	None
Section 2(o) defines restrictive trade practice while Section 2(u) defines trade practice.	None
Section 10 gives the jurisdiction to the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice.	None
This jurisdiction can be exercised either upon receiving of a complaint or upon reference made by the Government or upon an application by the Director General or upon its own knowledge or information.	None
Before a process is issued requiring the attendance upon any person the Commission may require, under Section 11, the Director General to make an investigation and to submit a report.	None
Section 12A contains the power of the Commission to grant temporary injunctions and the same reads as follows 12A. Power of the Commission to grant temporary injunctions.(1) Where, during an inquiry before the Commission, it is proved, whether by the complainant, Director General, any trader or class of traders or any other person, by affidavit or otherwise, that any undertaking or any person is carrying on, or is about to carry on, any monopolistic or any restrictive or unfair, trade practice and such monopolistic or restrictive, or unfair, trade practice is likely to affect prejudicially the public interest or the interest of any trader, class of traders or traders generally or of any consumer or consumers generally, the Commission may, for the purposes of staying or preventing the undertaking or, as the case may be, such person from causing such prejudicial effect, by order, grant a temporary injunction restraining such undertaking or person from carrying on any monopolistic or restrictive, or unfair, trade practice until the conclusion of such inquiry or until further orders.(2)	None
The provisions of Rules 2A to 5 (both inclusive) of Order XXXIX of the First Schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), shall, as far as may be, apply to a temporary injunction issued by the Commission under this section, as they apply to a temporary injunction issued by a Civil Court, and any reference in any such rule to a suit shall be construed as a reference to any inquiry before the Commission.	None
Section 14 relates to orders where a party concerned does not carry on business in India.	None
Section 15 contains the restriction of application of orders in certain cases and reads as follows Restriction of application of orders in certain cases.	None
No order made under this Act with respect to any monopolistic or restrictive trade practice shall operate so as to restrict(a) the right of any person to restrain any infringement of a patent granted in India, or(b) any person as to the condition which he attaches to a licence to do anything the doing of which but for the licence would be an infringement of a patent granted in India, or(c) the right of any person to export goods from India, to the extent to which the monopolistic or restrictive trade practice relates exclusively to the production, supply, distribution, or control of goods for such export.	None
Chapter V contains provisions relating to restrictive trade practices and unfair trade practices.	None
In the present case, it was the contention of the respondents that there were agreements between the Indian importers and the foreign parties which were registerable under Section 33 of the Act.	None
So far as the import of float glass is concerned, it was contended that the provisions of Section 33(1)(j) were attracted.	None
The relevant portions of Section 33 are as follows Registerable agreements relating to restrictive trade practices.(1)	Reasoning
Every agreement falling within one or more of the following categories shall be deemed, for the purposes of this Act, to be an agreement relating to restrictive trade practices and shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, namely(a) xxx xxx(b) xxx	None
xxx(c)	None
xxx xxx(d)	None
any agreement to purchase or sell goods or to tender for the sale or purchase of goods only at prices or on terms or conditions agreed upon between the sellers or purchasers(e) xxx xxx(f)	None
xxx xxx(g)	None
xxx xxx(h)	None
xxx xxx(i) xxx xxx(j)	None
any agreement to sell goods at such prices as would have the effect of eliminating competition or a competitor(ja)any agreement restricting in any manner, the class or number of wholesalers, producers or suppliers from whom any goods may be brought(jb)any agreement as to the bids which any of the parties thereto may offer at an auction for the sale of goods or any agreement whereby any party thereto agrees to abstain from bidding at any auction for the sale of goods(k) xxx xxx(l)	None
xxx xxx(2)	None
The provisions of this section shall apply, so far as may be, in relation to agreements making provision for services as they apply in relation to agreements connected with the production, storage, supply, distribution or control of goods.(3)	None
No agreement falling within this section shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter if it is expressly authorised by or under any law for the time being in force or has the approval of the Central Government or if the Government is a party to such agreement.	None
The registration of agreement is provided for by Section 35.	None
The relevant provisions of which are as follows Registration of agreement.(1)	None
The Central Government shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify a day (hereinafter referred to as the appointed day) on and from which every agreement falling within Section 33 shall become registerable under this ActProvided that different days may be appointed for different categories of agreements.(2) Within sixty days from the appointed day, in the case of an agreement existing on that day, and in the case of an agreement made after the appointed day within sixty days from the making thereof, there shall be furnished to the Director General in respect of every agreement falling within Section 33, the following particulars, namely(a) the names of the persons who are parties to the agreement and(b) the whole of the terms of the agreement.(3) If at any time after the agreement has been registered under this section, the agreement is varied (whether in respect of the parties or in respect of the terms thereof) or determined otherwise than by afflux of time, particulars of the variation or determination shall be furnished to the Director General within one month after the date of the variation or determination.(4)	None
The particulars to be furnished under this section in respect of an agreement shall be furnished(a) insofar as the agreement or any variation or determination of the agreement is made by an instrument in writing, by the production of the original or a true copy of that agreement and(b) insofar as the agreement or any variation or determination of the agreement is not so made, by the production of a memorandum in writing signed by the person by whom the particulars are furnished.(5)	None
The particulars to be furnished under this section shall be furnished by or on behalf of any person who is a party to the agreement or, as the case may be, was a party thereto immediately before its determination, and where the particulars are duly furnished by or on behalf of any such person, the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be complied with on the part of all such persons.	None
Explanation I.Where any agreement subject to registration under this section relates to the production, storage, supply, distribution or control of goods or the performance of any service in India and any party to the agreement carries on business in India, the agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement within the meaning of this section, notwithstanding that any other party to the agreement does not carry on business in India.xxx xxx xxx	Reasoning
The investigation by the Commission and the orders which may be passed by it relating to restrictive trade practices is dealt with by Section 37.	None
We will first consider whether the MRTP Act has extra territorial application.	None
In other words, can the MRTP Commission pass orders against parties who are not in India and who do not carry on business here and where agreements are entered into outside India with no Indian being a party to it.	None
The preamble of the MRTP Act reads as follows An Act to provide that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of economic power to the common detriment, for the control of monopolies, for the prohibition of monopolistic and restrictive trade practices and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.	Arguments of Petitioner
Presumably the economic system to which reference has been made in the preamble of the Act can only be with regard to the Indian economic system and not any other system in the world.	None
The object of the Act was that there should be no exploitation of the people of India, as a result of concentration of economic power or by reason of monopolistic and restrictive trade practices being carried out in India.29.	None
Section 1(2) states that the Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.	None
Section 2(a) defines agreement while Section 2(e) defines goods which reads as follows goods means goods as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930	None
(3 of 1930), and includes,(i) products manufactured, processed or mined in India(ii) shares and stocks including issue of shares before allotment(iii) in relation to goods supplied, distributed or controlled in India, goods imported into India Section 14 which has relevance on the point in issue reads as follows Orders where party concerned does not carry on business in India.	None
Where any practice substantially falls within monopolistic, restrictive, or unfair, trade practice, relating to the production, storage, supply, distribution or control of goods of any description of the provision of any services and any party to such practice does not carry on business in India, an order may be made under this Act with respect to that part of the practice which is carried on in India.	None
Reading Sections 1(2), 2(e) and 14 together can leave no manner of doubt that the Act has no extra territorial operation.	None
Section 1(2) specifically provides that the Act extends to the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir, thereby defining the geographical boundary of the operation of the Act.	None
Section 2(e)(iii) defines goods as including those goods which are supplied, distributed or controlled in India or the goods imported into India.	None
The emphasis is on the words in India or into India.	None
Paraphrasing the said subsection goods would mean those goods supplied in India or goods distributed in India or goods controlled in India or goods imported into India.	None
In the present case, we are concerned with float glass which was sought to be imported into India.	None
For the purpose of the Act, it is only the goods imported into India which will fall within the definition of the word goods in Section 2(e).	None
As such for the Commission to exercise any jurisdiction goods must be those which are imported into India.	None
As long as the import has not taken place and the goods are merely intended for export to India the same will not fall within the definition of the word goods in Section 2(e).	None
Even if there was any manner of doubt the same would stand dispelled by the plain reading of Section 14.	None
The said section visualizes where, inter alia, restrictive or unfair trade practice is carried on and any party to such practice does not carry on business in India then an order can be passed under the Act only with respect to that part of the practice which is carried on in India.	None
To put it differently, it is only that part of monopolistic, restrictive, or unfair, trade practice, relating to production, supply etc. of goods in India in respect of which orders can be passed.	None
To put matters beyond any doubt Explanation I to Section 35, which refers to agreements which are subject to registration under the said section, provides that when any party to the agreement for the production, supply, distribution etc. of goods or performance of any services in India carries on business in India then that agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement within the meaning of the section, notwithstanding that any other party to the agreement does not carry on business in India.	Reasoning
The meaning of this clearly is that it is only that agreement which would require registration in India if at least one party to the agreement carries on business in India.	None
It may happen that there may be two or more parties which enter into an agreement outside India, relating to supply or distribution of goods to India, the formation of such an agreement would not ipso facto require any registration even if it relates to restrictive trade practice but if one of the parties to an agreement carries on business in India then that agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement within the meaning of the section which would require registration.	None
The next question which would arise for consideration is whether the principle of effect doctrine has any application in India.	None
Where, in other words, actions take place and agreement are entered into outside India but the resultant adverse effect is experienced in India then can the MRTP Commission have any jurisdiction.	Reasoning
The preamble of the Act indicates that the MRTP Act was enacted, inter alia, for prohibiting any restrictive trade practice.	None
Restrictive trade practice has been defined in Section 2(o) which reads as follows restrictive trade practice means a trade practice which has, or may have, the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition in any manner and in particular,(i) which tends to obstruct the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, or(ii) which tends to bring about manipulation of prices, or conditions of delivery or to effect the flow of supplies in the market relating to goods or services in such manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions The expression trade practice has been defined under Section 2(u) which reads as under trade practice means any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade, and includes(i) anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders,(ii) a single or isolated action of any person in relation to any trade Section 33 of the Act deals with certain types of agreements stipulated therein to be an agreement relating to restrictive trade practice and such agreement requires to be registered.	None
Section 37(1) gives the Commission power to inquire whether an agreement is governed by Section 33 and has been registered under Section 35 or not.	None
Section 37 reads as under Investigation into restrictive trade practices by Commission.(1)	None
The Commission may inquire into any restrictive trade practice, whether the agreement, if any, relating thereto has been registered under Section 35 or not, which may come before it for inquiry and, if, after such inquiry it is of opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that(a) the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated(b) the agreement relating thereto shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or shall stand modified in respect thereof in such manner as may be specified in the order.(2)	None
The Commission may, instead of making any order under this section, permit the party to any restrictive trade practice, if he so applies to take such steps within the time specified in this behalf by Commission as may be necessary to ensure that the trade practice is no longer prejudicial to the public interest, and in any such case, if the Commission is satisfied that the necessary steps have been taken within the time specified, it may decide not to make any order under this section in respect of that trade practice.(3)	None
No order shall be made under Subsection (1) in respect of(a) any agreement between buyers relating to goods which are bought by the buyers for consumption and not for ultimate resale whether in the same or different form, type or specie or as constituent of some other goods(b) a trade practice which is expressly authorised by any law for the time being in force.	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if the Commission during the course of an inquiry under Subsection (1), finds that the owner of any undertaking is indulging in monopolistic trade practices, it may, after passing such orders under Subsection (1) or Subsection (2) with respect to the restrictive trade practices as it may consider necessary, submit the case alongwith its findings thereon to the Central Government for such action as that Government may take under Section 31.	None
Section 37 thus gives power to the Commission to inquire into any restrictive trade practice and if it is of the opinion that the practice is prejudicial to the public interest, the Commission may, by order, direct that the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated.	None
It appears to us that what is, inter alia, prohibited by the Act will be carrying on restrictive trade practice as defined in Sections 2(o) and 2(u) of the Act The restrictive trade practice may or may not be directly connected with or be the result of any agreement between the parties in India.	None
Any act which falls under the category of restrictive trade practice can be investigated into and orders passed under Section 37(1).	None
Sections 2(o) and 2(u) do not specifically indicate that the practice should be carried on only by a person or persons in India.	None
If the trade practice is such that it becomes a restricted trade practice in India as contemplated by Section 2(o), then action can be taken under Section 37(1) in respect of such a trade practice.	None
Section 38 provides that every restrictive trade practice shall be deemed to be prejudicial to the public interest unless the Commission is satisfied of any one or more of the circumstances mentioned in Clauses (a) to (k) of Section 38 exists and it is further satisfied that the restriction is not unreasonable having regard to the balance between those circumstances and any detriment to the public or to persons not parties to the agreement.	None
Section 2(u) does state that trade practice means any practice relating to the carrying on of any trade	None
but then it adds that such a trade practice would include anything done by any person which controls or affects the price charged by, or the method of trading of, any trader or any class of traders.	None
The Act and the aforesaid section, in particular, is therefore, concerned specifically with the incidence of the restrictive trade practice within India which in Section 2(o)(i) refers to the obstruction to the flow of capital or resources into the stream of production, while Section 2(o)(ii) talks of manipulation of prices or conditions of delivery or to effect the flow of supplies in the market but which must be such as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.	None
To put it differently, mere manipulation of prices or conditions of delivery would not be a restrictive trade practice under Section 2(o)(ii) unless it is done in such a manner so as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.	None
Lowering of prices cannot be regarded as imposing on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions.	None
Under Section 33(1)(j) of the Act, any agreement to sell goods at such prices as would have the effect of eliminating competition or a competitor is regarded as an agreement relating to restrictive trade practice and shall be subject to registration.	Reasoning
The Act nowhere states that this agreement should be only in India or between Indian parties.	Reasoning
In effect, this section recognizes the effects doctrine, namely, where an agreement results in sale of goods at such prices which would have the effect of eliminating competition or a competitor.	Reasoning
In the very nature of things, the sale of goods keeping in mind the definition of the word goods in Section 2(e) must be of goods imported into India, in the case like the present.	Reasoning
But if we replace the word goods in Section 33(1)(j) with the definition of goods in Section 2(e)(iii), then the Section 33(1)(j) would read as follows Any agreement to sell goods imported into India at such prices as would have the effect of eliminating competition or a competitor.	None
Thus, the agreement requiring registration must be in respect of goods after their import into India.	None
In other words, where the goods are already in India, then any agreement which has the effect of eliminating competition or a competitor of the sale of those goods existing in India would be a restrictive trade practice and it would be immaterial as to where the agreement takes place in relation to the sale of those goods.	Reasoning
The effects doctrine would be applicable only in relation to those goods which are within the territory of India before its sale referred to in Section 33(1)(j) of the Act.	None
An agreement, which results in sale outside India and the export of the goods to India, even if that sale is at predatory prices, would not fall within the ambit of Section 33(1)(j) of the Act.	Reasoning
It is a subsequent agreement of sale of the imported goods, if it has the effect of eliminating competition or a competitor, which would be registerable under Section 33(1)(j) of the Act.42.	Reasoning
Even if an agreement is executed outside India or the parties to the agreement are not in India and agreement may not be registerable under Section 33, being an outside India agreement, nevertheless, if any, restrictive trade practice, as a consequence of any such an outside agreement, is carried out in India then the Commission shall have jurisdiction under Section 37(1) in respect of that restrictive trade practice if it comes to the conclusion that the same is prejudicial to the public interest.43.	Reasoning
It is possible that persons outside India indulge in such trade practices, not necessarily restricted to the effectuation of prices within India, which have the effect of preventing, distorting or restricting competition in India or gives rise to a restrictive trade practice within India then in respect of that restrictive trade practice, MRTP Commission will have jurisdiction.	Reasoning
The Counsel for the respondents is right in submitting that if the effect of restrictive trade practices came to be felt in India because of a part of the trade practice being implemented here the MRTP Commission would have jurisdiction.	Reasoning
This effect doctrine will clothe the MRTP Commission with jurisdiction to pass an appropriate order even though a transaction, for example, which results in exporting goods to India at predatory price, which was in effect a restrictive trade practice, had been carried out outside the territory of India if the effect of that had resulted in a restrictive trade practice in India.	Reasoning
If power is not given to the MRTP Commission to have jurisdiction with regard to that part of trade practice in India which is restrictive in nature then it will mean that persons outside India can continue to indulge in such practices whose adverse effect is felt in India with impugnity.	Reasoning
A competition law like the MRTP Act is a mechanism to counter cross border economic terrorism.	Reasoning
Therefore, even though such an agreement may enter into outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Commission but if it results in a restrictive trade practice in India then the Commission will have jurisdiction under Section 37 to pass appropriate orders in respect of such restrictive trade practice.	Reasoning
We will now consider whether the Antidumping provisions will oust the jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission, as has been contended by the appellants.	None
The jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission, in our opinion, is not ousted by the Antidumping provisions in the Customs Act.	Reasoning
The two Acts operate in different fields and have different purposes.	Reasoning
The Import Control Act and the Customs Tariff Act are concerned with import of goods into India and the duty which could be imposed on the imported items.	Reasoning
Import may be allowed on the basis of an import licence or, depending upon the policy, import may be allowed under OGL Open General Licence  where no specific licence for import is required.	Reasoning
Whether to allow import or not and the terms on which an item may be imported is a matter of policy and regulated by law.46.	Reasoning
There is in this case no challenge to the import policy allowing import of float glass and even if such a challenge was to be there it would hardly succeed.	Reasoning
The grievance of the respondents is that import is being made at predatory prices.	Reasoning
The challenge is to the actual import.	Reasoning
But allowing such a challenge will amount to giving the MRTP Commission jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the legal validity of the provisions relating to import, which jurisdiction the Commission does not have.	Reasoning
It is not a Court with power of judicial review over legislative action.	Reasoning
Therefore, it would have no jurisdiction to decide whether the action of the Government in permitting import of float glass even at predatory prices is valid or not.	Reasoning
The Commission cannot prohibit import, it is jurisdiction commences after import is completed and any restrictive trade practice takes place.	Reasoning
Customs duty on import of any goods is levied under the provisions of the Customs Tariff Act.	None
The rate at which the import duty is to be levied is a matter of policy.	None
The rate of duty is determined by the Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act and is subject to such exemption as may be granted under that Act.	None
Thus the rate of import duty which is imposed is a legislative act and is thus not amenable to the jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission.	None
A party cannot contend before the MRTP Commission that the rate of duty is too high or too low.	None
In fact, such a challenge is hardly likely to succeed in a Court of law and the question of the MRTP Commission having such a jurisdiction does not arise.48.	Reasoning
Apart from the rate of duty the value of the goods imported has to be determined for the purpose of levy of duty.	Reasoning
The customs authorities are required to determine whether the value of the goods imported has been correctly declared.	Reasoning
In case of wrong valuation, the customs authorities can determine the correct value and levy duty thereon.	Reasoning
Normally the goods are valued at the price at which they are actually purchased.	Reasoning
Then that will be the value at which the duty will be imposed.	Reasoning
It is not the case of the respondents that the appellants are guilty of undervaluing the goods imported.	Reasoning
It is the low price which has been charged by the Indonesian exporter which is really the object of attack.49.	Reasoning
The levy or nonlevy of antidumping or other duty being a legislative act pursuant to the exercise of powers under the Customs Tariff Act can also not be a subjectmatter of judicial review by the MRTP Commission.	Reasoning
The two Acts substantially operate in different fields and the following table brings out some of the distinctions between the MRTP Commission and the Antidumping provisions COMPETITION LAW ANTIDUMPING ACTIONS ACTIONS Competition law is concerned An antidumping law iswith the regulation of concerned with addressing justcompetition in a particular one type of unfair, internationalmarket within the territory of a trade practice that causes injurycountry.	Reasoning
Thus, it would take to domestic industry, i.e.,within its sweep a whole host of dumping of goods by ananticompetitive practices exporting country.including (i) monopolistic tradepractices, as defined in Section2(i) of the MRTP Act, (ii)restrictive trade practices, asdefined in Section 2(o), and (iii)unfair trade practices as definedin Section 36A.2.

A perusal of the above chart indicates that the two statutes and regimes operate in different and distinct spheres and there is no conflict between the two regimes statutes.	None
Hence, the question of implied repeal of the provisions of Section 33(1)(j) of the MRTP Act, 1969 on account of the provisions of Section 9A of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 does not arise.	Arguments of Respondent
It is thus seen that the provisions relating to antidumping contained in the Customs Tariff Act do not in any way affect the power or jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission.	Reasoning
The Import Control Act and the Customs Tariff Act on the one hand and the MRTP Act on the other operate in different independent fields and the authority under one has no jurisdiction over the other.	None
In other words, their paths do not cross each other.	None
While the provisions of Antidumping Act are concerned with the levy of antidumping duty, the MRTP Act in the present case would be concerned with the agreements between the parties which relate to the restrictive trade practices.	None
Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that the incorporation of the antidumping provisions ousts the jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission to inquire and pass orders, inter alia, with regard restrictive trade practice in India.	None
It was submitted that import by the Indian party from Indonesia at predatory prices required the agreement for import to be registered as per Section 33(1)(j) of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the facts of this case, we are not inclined to agree that such a case is made out.	None
As far as Section 33(1)(j) is concerned, there must be an agreement between the foreign seller and the Indian importer to sell goods at such prices as would have the effect of eliminating competition of a competitor, i.e., here the Indian industry.	Reasoning
What seems to have happened here is that the monopolistic Indian undertakings are now having to face competition.	Reasoning
The quantum of import in the present case is a small fraction of the total float glass which is manufactured and sold in India.	Reasoning
The reduction in prices of the Indian importer is to the benefit of the Indian customer.	Reasoning
It is only if there is an agreement between the Indian importer and the foreign seller which has such an effect that the production in India of float glass by efficient Indian industry would have to stop and such stoppage is considered prejudicial to the public interest, can an order under Section 12A or Section 37 be passed.	Reasoning
It is the case of the petitioners that the Indian manufacturers have formed a cartel of their own and are charging high prices because of lack of competition.	Reasoning
It is alleged that the Indian manufacturers are making much profits and despite import of float glass having taken place for the last 510 years the Indian industry has not suffered.	Reasoning
On the other hand, the volume of sales has increased and the profit of the Indian producers not decreased.	Reasoning
Under these circumstances, it was contended, the passing of the injunction was wholly uncalled for.	Reasoning
Import of material at prices lower than prevailing in India cannot per se be regarded as being prejudicial to the public interest.	None
If the normal or export price of any goods outside India is lower than the selling price of an indigenously produced item then to say that the import is prejudicial to the public interest would not be correct.	None
The availability of goods outside India at prices lower than those which are indigenously produced would encourage competition amongst the Indian industry and would not per se result in eliminating the competitor, as was sought to be submitted by the respondents.	None
It is while dealing with a complaint relating to restrictive trade practice that the MRTP Commission has the jurisdiction to grant temporary injunction under Section 12A(1).	None
It is only on the basis of proof, and not mere allegation, and on the basis of an inquiry before the Commission that any trade or class of traders is carrying on a restrictive trade practice which is likely to affect prejudicially the public interest or the interest of any trader, class of traders or traders generally or of consumers that the Commission would have jurisdiction to grant a temporary injunction restraining any undertaking or person from carrying on any restrictive trade practice.	None
While the Commission has power to grant exparte temporary injunction, but in view of Explanation II to Section 12A, whereby the provisions of Rule 2A of Order XXXIX of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are made applicable, for the grant of temporary injunction the Commission normally ought to give notice and hear the respondents before passing an order of injunction.	None
What is, however, important is that the conditions stipulated in Section 12A(1) have to be satisfied before an order for injunction can be passed.	None
In other words, it has to be proved that the respondents before the Commission is carrying on or about to carry on a restrictive trade practice which will be prejudicial to the public interest or to the interest of traders etc.	None
before an order for injunction can be issued.	None
Merely because an industry will finds itself unable to be able to compete with imports from outside can be of no ground for exercising jurisdiction under Section 12A(1).	None
It is only if the trade practice which is being impugned is such that would fall within the four corners of Section 2(o), which defines restrictive trade practice, can the Commission grant an injunction.	None
The facts on record do not indicate any justification for any interim order being passed in the present case.	None
Furthermore, the impugned order passed against the foreign manufacturers of float glass, who do not carry on business in India is clearly contrary to the provisions of Section 14 of the Act and, as such cannot be sustained.	None
In our opinion, the MRTP Commission has no extra territorial jurisdiction.	Reasoning
The action of an exporter to India when performed outside India would not be amenable to jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission.	Reasoning
The MRTP Commission cannot pass an order determining the export price of an exporter to India or prohibiting him to export to India at a low or predatory price.55.	Reasoning
The matter may be examined from another angle.	Reasoning
In this case, there is a sale of float glass by the exporter in Indonesia.	Reasoning
If the float glass was ready and available, then being ascertained goods the sale would be regarded as having taken place where the goods existed at the time of sale, i.e., in Indonesia.	Reasoning
If the glass had to be manufactured and not readily identifiable, then the sale would take place outside India when the goods are appropriated to the contract by the foreign exporter.	Reasoning
Here the appropriation would take place in Indonesia when the glass is earmarked and exported to India.	Reasoning
In either case the MRTP Commission would have no jurisdiction to stop that sale.	Reasoning
If the said sale cannot be stopped and the import policy permits the Indian importer to import on payment of duty then we fail to see what jurisdiction the MRTP Commission can possibly have till a restrictive trade practice takes place after float glass is imported into India.	Reasoning
It is not as if the Indian industry has no remedy against goods being exported to India at predatory prices.	None
It is because of the need for such a provision that the Customs Act was amended and antidumping provisions were incorporated.	None
Recourse to this was taken by the respondents but then that remedy was not pursued.	None
At this stage, it is relevant to refer to the provisions of Section 11 of the Customs Act.	None
The said section gives the Central Government a power to prohibit importation or exportation of goods, if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so for any of the purposes specified in Subsection (2).	None
Under Subsection (2), such prohibition can be for the purpose of establishment of any industry Subclause (i) preventing serious injury to domestic production of goods of any description Subclause (j) the compliance of the imported goods with any laws which are applicable to similar goods produced or manufactured in India Subclause (s) the prevention of the contravention of any law for the time being in force Subclause (u) and any other purpose conducive to the interest of general public Subclause (v).	None
Inasmuch as, the import into the country is, inter alia, governed by the Customs Act and the power to prohibit or not to prohibit the importation of any goods is with the Government, then unless and until, a law prohibiting import is infringed, it is difficult to perceive as to how the MRTP Commission can prevent the importation of the goods.	Reasoning
In this connection, it is also useful to refer to Section 33(3) of the Act which reads as under No agreement falling within this section shall be subject to registration in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter if it is expressly authorized by or under any law for the time being in force or has the approval of the Central Government or if the Government is a party to such agreement.	None
Inasmuch as the importation of float glass is permitted by law, under the provisions of the Customs Act and the Import Control Act, then an agreement in relation to such an import may not be liable to be registered under the provisions of the Act.	None
It is only in respect of float glass, which is imported and thereafter if in respect to that a restrictive trade practice is indulged can the MRTP Commission have jurisdiction qua post import Indian end of the transaction.	Reasoning
Conclusions From the aforesaid discussion and reasons, we arrive at the following conclusions Antidumping provisions do not per se oust the jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission.(2)	Reasoning
The MRTP Commission can, inter alia, take action whenever a Restrictive Trade Practice is carried out in India in respect of imported goods or otherwise.(3)	Reasoning
It is only in respect of the Indian leg of the restrictive trade practice, can an order under Section 12A and or Section 37 be passed.(4) Under Section 33 of the Act what can be registered is only an agreement in regard to which any party to an agreement carries on business in India Section 35 Explanation I.	Reasoning
But this does not mean that if an agreement is entered into outside India and which results in a Restrictive Trade Practice in India, the MRTP Commission has no jurisdiction.	Reasoning
The effects doctrine will apply and Section 2(o) read with Section 2(u) and Section 37 gives jurisdiction to the MRTP Commission to pass appropriate orders qua the Restrictive Trade Practice in India.	Reasoning
The MRTP Commission, in such a case, may not be able to stop import but there can be order imposing post import restrictions such as, for example, not to sell imported goods in India in such a manner which will be regarded as a restrictive trade practice under Section 37.(5)	Reasoning
In Explanation I to Section 35 the use of the words shall be deemed to be an agreement within the meaning of this section and the timeframe for registration clearly indicates that Section 33 and Section 35 apply only to Indian agreements or agreements in India and, therefore, it became necessary to incorporate Explanation I so as to enlarge the ambit and give extra territorial jurisdiction in relation to those agreements which relate to performance of services in India and any party to that agreement carries on business in India.(6)	Reasoning
On the facts of this case, the impugned order passed by the MRTP Commission against the Indonesian exporters cannot be sustained and is set aside.	Reasoning
Appeals are disposed of in the aforesaid terms.	Decision

Civil Appeal No. 3562 of 2000 Interim order of the MRTP Commission restraining the appellant from dispatching, directly or indirectly, Soda Ash to India is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal.2.	None
The complainant M s. Alkali Manufacturers Association of India (AMAI for short) had filed a complaint before the MRTP Commission under Section 33(1)(d), Section 36A and Section 40 read with Section 2(i) and (o) of the MRTP Act.	None
The complainant Association had 34 members carrying on the business of Soda Ash in India.	Facts
In the complaint, it was stated that the Soda Ash was being manufactured by six companies in India and was being sold to the Indian consumers at a net price of Rs. 8,190/ to	Facts
Rs. 8,320/	Facts
PMT net of excise.	Facts
It was alleged that the appellant M s. American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ANSAC) consisted of six producers of natural Soda Ash who have joined together to form an Export Cartel by virtue of a Membership Agreement amongst them entered into in America on 8th December, 1983.	Facts
By this agreement, the six producers had agreed that all export sales by them or by any of their subsidiaries will be made through ANSAC which was set up as a Corporation in accordance with the provisions of the United States Export Trade Act, 1918.	Facts
It was further alleged in the complaint that ANSAC in an attempt to invade the Indian market and undercut the Indian producers, it sold American Soda Ash to Indian consumers at an unrealistically low price of US 132 PMTCIF.	Facts
With a view to circumvent the prohibition in Indian law against monopolistic, restrictive and unfair trade practices, a strategy had been adopted by ANSAC by selling American Soda Ash to Indian consumers though the front of one M s. G. Premjee of Singapore in whose favour the Indian producers had opened letters of credit.	Facts
According to this complaint, there was a bulk sale of Soda Ash by ANSAC to the Indian consumers through the conduit of M s. G. Premjee of Singapore.	Facts
On the basis of these averments, namely, that ANSAC was a Cartel of American Soda Ash Producers and was likely to affect maintenance of prices at reasonable and realistic levels in India and with a view to adversely affect the local production and availability of Soda Ash, the MRTP Commission should enquire against this restrictive and unfair trade practice and grant an exparte injunction restraining ANSAC from despatching the goods.	Facts
On the basis of these allegations, the MRTP Commission on 9th September, 1996 passed an adinterim injunction, which was subsequently confirmed by it, directing ANSAC not to indulge in the practice of cartelisation by exporting Soda Ash to India in the form of cartel directly or indirectly.	Facts
The order further stated that it was without prejudice to the final outcome of the said enquiry as well as to the rights of the importers or exporters in the individual capacity to export Soda Ash to India.	Facts
This order has been affirmed by the Commission by its order of 9th March, 2000.3.	Facts
While denying that ANSAC was a cartel or that export of Soda Ash of India was violative of any of the provisions of the MRTP Act, ANSAC has submitted in this appeal that the MRTP had no extraterritorial jurisdiction and furthermore in view of the provisions of the antidumping law, the MRTP Commission had no jurisdiction to decide the case.4.	Facts
This appeal was heard along with Civil Appeal No. 2330 of 2000, M s. Haridas Exports v. All India Float Glass Manufacturers Association.	Facts
In Haridas Exports case common contentions raised in this appeal regarding jurisdiction of the MRTP Commission and the scope and ambit of the MRTP Act visavis AntiDumping Duty have been dealt with.	Facts
We now propose to deal with the allegation of export by the appellant, which is alleged to be a cartel, and whether there was justification for granting the injunction.5.	Facts
Some more undisputed facts, which are relevant may first be mentioned.	None
ANSAC was set up under the Webb Powerence Act of U.S.A. as an export agency, the six producers of Soda Ash in U.S.A. being its members.	None
Like a canalising agency exports of natural Soda Ash by these producers cannot be made by the members individually.	None
Exports of Soda Ash from U.S.A. are made by the canalising agency, namely, the appellant.6.	None
While the Indian companies manufacture synthetic Soda Ash, the American companies export natural Soda Ash which is cheaper to produce than the Indian Soda Ash.	None
Since its inception in 1983, the appellant had sold for export to India only one consignment equal to 1.44 per cent of the annual production of India, and it is in respect of this consignment that the MRTP Commission issued injunction restraining its import.	None
Till today, therefore, no Soda Ash has been exported by the appellant to India.7.	None
It was submitted by the respondent that the agreement of 1983 formed a cartel and was registrable under Section 33(1)(d) of the MRTP Act.8.	Arguments of Respondent
Insofar as Section 33(1)(d) is concerned, the scheme appears to be that every agreement falling under Section 33(1)(a) to (l) is presumed to be one relating to restrictive trade practice and is subject to registration.	Reasoning
An agreement falling under Section 33 need not necessarily be one in writing inasmuch as Section 2(a) defines an agreement as including any arrangement or understanding as well.	Reasoning
Therefore, if apart from written agreement there is an arrangement or understanding amongst the sellers or the purchasers with regard to the purchase or sale of goods to be only at the prices or on terms or conditions agreed upon amongst them then such an agreement would require registration.	Reasoning
Section 33(1)(d) regards an agreement to be one relating to restrictive trade practice if such agreement relates to purchase or sale of goods or to tender for sale or purchase of goods only at prices or on terms or conditions agreed upon amongst the sellers or amongst the purchasers.	Reasoning
Such an agreement amongst the sellers or amongst the purchasers relating to purchase or sale or to the prices in respect thereof may be regarded as the formation of a cartel.9.	Reasoning
Section 35 specifies the period within which every agreement falling under Section 33 becomes registrable.	None
As we have already noticed, Explanation I would make such an agreement registrable only when at least one party to the agreement carries on business in India.	None
On an agreement being filed under Section 35 particulars are furnished to the Director General who is required to maintain a register under Section 36.	None
Section 37 then gives the jurisdiction to the Commission to make an inquiry, whether an agreement is registered or not, in order to find out if a restrictive trade practice is prejudicial to the public interest.	None
The effect of this is that by not registering an agreement falling under Sections 33 and 35 the Commission is not divested of its jurisdiction of exercising its powers under Section 37.	None
The opening words of Section 37 make it quite clear that an inquiry into any restrictive trade practice can be made by the Commission even in relation to an agreement which is not registered.	None
Therefore, once an agreement comes to the notice of the Commission which is to be regarded as containing a restrictive trade practice then the Commission is under an obligation to find out and determine whether in its opinion the practice is prejudicial to the public interest.	None
It is only if the Commission is satisfied that there is prejudice to the public interest then the Commission has the jurisdiction to direct either that the practice shall be discontinued or shall not be repeated or to hold that any such agreement which is prejudicial to the public interest shall be void in respect of such restrictive trade practice or that the said agreement shall be modified in such a manner as may be specified.	None
If remedial steps have been taken then, as contemplated by Section 37(2), no order need be passed by the Commission.	None
One further restriction on the power of the Commission to pass order is also contained in Section 37(3)(b) which provides that if a trade practice is expressly authorised to be carried on by any law for the time being in force then no order shall be passed under Section 37.	None
This Explanation is in addition to the provisions of Section 38 which deals with cases relating to presumption as to the agreement of the types mentioned there in being in the public interest.10.	None
The impact of reading of the provisions together is that what is sought to be targeted in relation to restrictive trade practice is not the nature or the factum of the restriction but such restriction should not be prejudicial to the public interest.	None
For example, an agreement may be entered into amongst the purchasers in order to ensure constant supply of goods at a reasonable rate.	None
Such an agreement even though it may fall under Section 33(1)(d) would not be regarded as being prejudicial to the public interest.11.	None
It is in this context that when we examine the provisions of Section 12A, we find that the power of the Commission to grant temporary injunction arises only after it is satisfied that a restrictive trade practice or unfair trade practice is being carried on which is likely to affect prejudicially the public interest or the interest of the trader or class of traders etc.	None
It is only with a view to prevent the causing of a prejudicial effect that an interim order can be passed by the Commission under Section 12A.12.	None
As we have already seen the Act does not have any extra territorial operation.	None
An agreement which is referred to under Section 33(1)(d) must, therefore, be of a kind in which a person in India is a party.	None
This is clear from the bare reading of Explanation I to Section 35.	None
This means that for an agreement to fall within the ambit of Section 33(1)(d) and in respect of which the Commission can exercise its powers under Section 37 a person in India must be regarded as one of the sellers who is a person to such an agreement.	None
This is clear from the use of the words any party to the agreement carries on business in India occurring in Explanation I to Section 35.	None
A careful reading of Section 33(1)(d) indicates that it refers to two classes of agreements.	None
One class is an agreement to purchase goods or to tender for the purchase of goods only at prices or on terms or conditions agreed upon between the purchasers.	None
The other class is an agreement to sell goods or to tender for the sale of goods only at prices or on terms or conditions agreed upon between the sellers.	None
In other words, Section 33(1)(d) refers to the agreements which have the effect of forming either a buyers cartel or a sellers cartel.	None
This subsection does not refer to or deal with agreement of sale and purchase between sellers and purchasers.13.	None
In the case of import of Soda Ash, the contention is that the appellant is a cartel in America which was proposing to sell Soda Ash to India at very low prices with a view to eliminate competition and to adversely affect the Indian industry.	Arguments of Petitioner
Any agreement of sale by the appellant to an Indian purchaser would not attract the provisions of Section 33(1)(d), which refers only to cartelising agreements and not to agreements of sale and purchase.	Arguments of Petitioner
But the MRTP Commission will have jurisdiction under Section 37 to pass orders if such a sale was to amount to being a restrictive trade practice.	Arguments of Petitioner
For the Commission to have jurisdiction to pass such an order, whether interim or final, it must come to the conclusion that it is in public interest to do so.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is to be borne in mind that public interest does not necessarily mean interest only of the industry.	Arguments of Petitioner
Unless and until it can be demonstrated that an efficient Indian industry would be forced to shut down or suffer serious loss resulting in closure or unemployment, the Commission ought not to pass an injunction restraining an Indian party from importing goods from a cartel at predatory prices.	Arguments of Petitioner
Importing goods at a price lower than what is available in India is not per se illegal.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have provisions under the Customs Act which enables the Government to impose antidumping duties with a view to protect the Indian industry.	Arguments of Petitioner
Nevertheless, the era of protectionism is now coming to an end.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Indian industry has to gear up so as to meet the challenges from abroad.	Arguments of Petitioner
If the cartel is selling goods to India and still making profit then it will not be in the interest of the general body of the consumers in India to prevent the import of such goods.	Arguments of Petitioner
The remedy of the Indian industry, in such an event, is to take recourse to the provisions under the Customs Act in relation to the levy of antidumping duties.14.	Arguments of Petitioner
A cartel is formed, inter alia, with a view that members of the cartel do not wage a price war and they sell at an agreed or uniform price.	None
There may perhaps also be a cartel where members divide the territories to which each of them can export.	None
There is little doubt that the object of an export cartel is to capture a market even if at first, it may result in a loss to the exporter.15.	None
The competition law in the form of MRTP as it stands today does not contain any provision, which can give it jurisdiction to interfere merely with cartel formation.	None
Formation of cartel which takes place outside India is outside the territorial jurisdiction of the MRTP.	None
The Indian importer obtaining goods at a low price does not contravene any law.	None
He has obtained a good bargain.16.	None
We need not go into the question whether antidumping provisions in the Customs Act can be an effective remedy against such cartelisation.	Reasoning
But if the cartel caries out Restrictive Trade Practice in India or its actions have the effect of a Restrictive Trade Practice being carried out in India, then the MRTP Commission will get jurisdiction to act under Section 37(1) of the MRTP Act.17.	Reasoning
We make it clear that we are expressing no opinion as to whether the appellant is a cartel or on the question of predatory prices for the reason that we are satisfied that here no case had been made out by the respondents for the grant of injunction against the appellant.	Reasoning
The injunction issued against the appellant was not only against the provisions of Section 14 of the Act but even on facts as alleged no case had really been made out for any order under Section 12A or Section 37 of the Act more so when no import of Soda Ash into India from the appellant had, in fact, taken place.	Reasoning
On the other hand, prima facie the allegation of the appellant that it is the respondents which have formed a cartel and do not welcome any competition does merit consideration, perhaps in another case.18.	Reasoning
For the aforesaid reasons, this appeal is allowed with costs.	None
