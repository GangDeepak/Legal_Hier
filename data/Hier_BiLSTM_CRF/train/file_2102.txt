Submissions Mr. Mohan Parasaran, learned Additional Solicitor General of India submits that the heading under Chapter 20 in the Central Excise Tariff have been compressed and there is only one chapter heading 2001 to 2009, accordingly a reference to the chapter headings of HSN gives clearer picture of the items intended to be covered under this chapter.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the HAS, 20.08 is the only chapter heading which can cover the products of Herbonic.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, this chapter contains a specific exclusion of products consisting of mixtures of plants and parts of plants of different specifies etc.	Arguments of Petitioner
The structure of central excise tariff in the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 is the adoption of a detailed central excise tariff based broadly on the system of classification derived from the International Convention called the Brussels Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonised System of Nomenclature called HSN) with the necessary modifications.	Arguments of Petitioner
If the expression used in the Tariff Act and HSN is the same then the meaning which is expressly given in the HSN should be preferred in the absence of anything to the contrary given in the Tariff Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
For this he has relied upon the judgment of this Court in Collector of Central Excise, Shillong vs. Wood Craft Products Ltd. (1995 (77) E.L.T. 23) in which it has been observed It is significant, as expressly stated, in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, that the Central Excise Tariffs are based on the HSN and the internationally accepted nomenclature was taken into account to reduce disputes on account of tariff classification.	None
Accordingly, for resolving any dispute relating to tariff classification a safe guide is the internationally accepted nomenclature emerging from the HSN.	None
This being the expressly acknowledged basis of the structure of Central Excise Tariff in the Act and the tariff classification made therein, in case of any doubt the HSN is a safe guide for ascertaining the true meaning of any expression used in the Act.	None
The ISI Glossary of Terms has a different purpose and, therefore, the specific purpose of tariff classification for which the internationally accepted nomenclature in HSN has been adopted, for enacting the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, must be preferred, in case of any difference between the meaning of the expression given in the HSN and the meaning of that term given in the Glossary of Terms of the ISI.	None
It is further observed in para 18 Since the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985 is enacted on the basis and pattern of the HSN, the same expression used in the Act must, as far as practicable, be construed to have the meaning which is expressly given to it in the HSN when there is no indication in the Indian Tariff of a different intention.	None
It was further contended that because Herbonic is a mixture of vegetable origin and fruit origin raw material, the same gets specifically excluded from the provisions of Chapter 20.08 under HSN and therefore also from Chapter 20 of the Central Excise Tariff.	Arguments of Petitioner
Chapter heading 21.06 of HSN at Sl.	Arguments of Petitioner
No. 14, specifically covers mixture of plants or parts of plants of different species with special reference to the product, which contributes to general health and well being.	Arguments of Petitioner
Herbonic which is claimed to be a tonic and does not have any therapeutic or prophylactic properties is specifically covered under Chapter heading 2106 of the HSN and Chapter heading 21.07 or Chapter heading 21.08 (depending on the period involved) of the Central Excise Tariff.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him the correct classification of the produce Herbonic should be under Chapter 2107/2108.As against this, learned counsel for the respondents contends that Chapter Note 1 of Chapter 20 is a specific entry which deals with preparation of vegetable, fruit or nuts where as Entry 21.08 in Chapter 21 is residuary.	None
Since Chapter 20.01 is specific on such preparation the product should be covered by this description and qualifies for classification under Chapter heading 20.01.	Arguments of Respondent
As per Rule 3(a) of the rules of interpretation of ScheduleI, The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description.	Arguments of Respondent
Since the respondents preparation is covered by entries in Chapter 20, the same should be preferred to the residuary clause in Chapter 21 which is of general description.	Arguments of Respondent
Relying upon the judgments of this Court in Bharat Forge Press Industries (P) Ltd. vs. Collector of Central Excise, (1990 (45) E.L.T. 525), Indian Metals Ferro Alloys Ltd. vs. Collector of Central Excise, (1991) (51) E.L.T. 165), Speedway Rubber Co. vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, Chandigarh, (2002 (143) E.L.T. 8) and C.C. (General), New Delhi vs. Gujarat Perstorp Electronics Ltd. (2005)	Arguments of Respondent
(186) E.L.T. 532), it was contended that the Heading Note which is more specific should be preferred to the residuary clause.	Arguments of Respondent
Findings The product under reference is a mixture of assorted vegetation and dry fruits and seeds.	Reasoning
That different vegetations namely Khas Khas, Aswagandha Brahmi Booti is turned into powder and processed in Khas Khas and giri badam (almond) oil and then the whole mixture is processed in sugar syrup under vacuum and thereafter choti illayachii (cardamom) and roof kewara are added as flavour.	Reasoning
Since the product Herbonic is mixture of different vegetation it is rightly been classified by the Tribunal under Chapter 20.	Reasoning
In Chapter 21 there is an entry reading as Edible preparations, not elsewhere specified or included under the particular heading Miscellaneous Edible Preparations.	Reasoning
Chapter Note 9(a) of the Chapter 21 reads Heading No. 21.08, inter alia includes (a) protein concentrates and textured protein substances (b) preparations of use, either directly or after processing (such as cooking, dissolving or boiling in water, milk or other liquids), for human consumption.	Reasoning
Subheading 2107.91 2108.90 covers other edible preparations not elsewhere specified and as such is residuary in nature.	Reasoning
As per Rule 3 (a) of the rules of interpretation of ScheduleI, the heading which provides the specific description should be preferred to the heading providing a general description.	Reasoning
In Bharat Forge Press Industries (P) Ltd. (supra) a three Judge Bench of this Court held that if a product cannot be brought under the specific entries in the tariff Act only then resort can be made to a residuary entry.	None
It was held in para 3 as under The question before us is whether the Department is right in claiming that the items in question are dutiable under tariff entry No. 68.	None
This, as mentioned already, is the residuary entry and only such goods as cannot be brought under the various specific entries in the tariff should be attempted to be brought under the residuary entry.	None
In other words, unless the department can establish that the goods in question can be no conceivable process of reasoning be brought under any of the tariff items, resort cannot be had to the residuary item.	None
To the same effect is the judgment in Indian Metals Ferro Alloys Ltd. (supra), it was observed in para 16 as under One more aspect of the issue should be adverted to before we conclude.	None
The, assessee is relying upon a specific entry in the tariff schedule while the department seeks to bring the goods to charge under the residuary Item No. 68.	None
It is a settled principle that unless the department can establish that the goods in question can, by no conceivable process of reasoning by brought under any of the specific items mentioned in the tariff, resort cannot be had to the residuary item See the Bharat Forge Case (supra).	None
This certainly is not the position in this case, particularly in the light of the departments own understanding and interpretation of Item 26AA.	None
In Speedway Rubber Co. (supra) this Court observed in para 23 as under We may notice that as per Rule 3(a) of the Interpretation Rules to Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description.	None
In C.C. (General), New Delhi (supra) it was observed in para 57 as under There is still one more aspect which is relevant.	None
It cannot be disputed and is not disputed before us and is also concluded by a decision of a three Judge Bench in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. that the basic heading is 49.01.	None
It deals with Printed books, brochures, leaflets and similar printed matter, whether or not in single sheets.	None
49.11 covers Other printed matter, including printed pictures and photographs.	None
Thus, specific or basic heading is 49.01 and residual entry is 49.11.	None
Priority, therefore, has to be given to the main entry and not the residual entry.	None
According to the Company, the case is covered by the main entry under 49.01 and in that view of the matter, one cannot consider the residual entry 49.11.	None
Since in the present case the product is covered under specific entry under Chapter 20 resort cannot be made to the residuary entry.22.	Reasoning
The exclusionary note in HSN of Entry 20.08 of Chapter 20 of HSN is not applicable because it excludes the products consisting of mixture of plants or parts of plants (including seeds and fruits) of different species or consisting of plants or parts of plants which are not consumed as such but which are of a kind used for making herbal infusions or herbal teas.	Reasoning
In the present case the mixture prepared is of parts of plants, seeds and nuts which can be consumed as such.	Reasoning
It would therefore be not applicable.	Reasoning
Entry 14 of Chapter 2106.90 produced above would also be not applicable since in this case we are holding that the present case would be governed by Chapter 20 of the Tariff Act and not Chapter 21 of the Tariff Act.	Reasoning
The Entry 14 referred to above is a part of Chapter 21 of HSN which corresponds to Chapter 21 of Tariff Act which is not applicable to the present case.	Reasoning
In conclusion, we hold that the Tribunal is right in holding that the product of the respondents is covered by Chapter 20 of the Tariff Act and not Chapter 21 of the Tariff Act.24.	Decision
For the reasons stated above, we do not find any merit in these appeals and dismiss the same with no order as to costs.	Decision
