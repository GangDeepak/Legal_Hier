Union of India Ors. 2014(2) SCCC 609, we are not inclined to grant any relief in this writ petition.16.	Reasoning
At the outset, we find that the writ petitioner has not claimed any relief in person qua respondent No.12 Company, in this writ petition.	Reasoning
Even otherwise, no writ lies under Article 32 of the Constitution at the instance of any employee or the employer for claiming enforcement of any personal contractual rights inter se the employee and his employer.17.	Reasoning
If the writ petitioner has any personal grievance in relation to any of his contractual personal rights flowing from any service conditions or any other agreement with therespondent No.12 Company, his legal remedy lies in filing Civil Suit or take recourse to any other civil law remedy for adjudication and enforcement of his rightsquarespondent No.12 Company or anyone claiming through them as the case may be.	Reasoning
The writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is not the remedy for agitating any such grievance.18.	Reasoning
It is not in dispute that the parties are already prosecuting their grievances against each other in Civil Court in their respective civil suits filed by them against each other.	Reasoning
If that be the position, the same have to be pursued by them in accordance with law against each other.19.	Reasoning
So far as the raising of other grievances as set out supraby the writ petitioner against the other respondents are concerned, suffice it to say, this court by order dated 11.07.2018had issued notice tothe official respondents Nos.7 to 11.	Reasoning

Before parting, we make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on several factual issues alleged 9 and denied by all the parties against each other in this writ petition and in respective IAs.	Reasoning
22.	Reasoning
This order, therefore, will not influence any authority or the Court or ongoing inquiry or proceedings while dealing with any issue.	Reasoning
