In the light of the aforesaid evidence which has been referred to in detail, to be discussed hereinafter.	Facts
We first consider whether the criminal conspiracy in order to commit the murder of Mr. Haren Pandya, to strike terror in a section of people has been proved, as such the accused has committed the offence under section 3 of POTA It has been urged that section 3(1), 3(2), 3(3) and 3(4) and section 4 of POTA have rightly been invoked in the present case.	Facts
Accused persons have been charged for criminal conspiracy under section 120B, IPC and for conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism under section 3(1) and 3(3) and section 4 of the POTA.	Facts
It is urged that there is reasonable ground to believe that when two or more persons have conspired together to commit any offence, anything said, done or written by any one of them in reference to their common intention, is a relevant fact as against each conspirator.	Facts
It is submitted that the accused persons with an intention to strike terror in a section of people, used firearms, caused murder of Mr. Haren Pandya and attempted to murder Jagdish Tiwari, PW39.	Facts
Thus, they committed offence under section 3(1) of POTA.	Facts
The Central Pota Review Committee has upheld the invocation of the provisions of POTA.	Facts
The High Court has also upheld the conviction of the accused persons under section 3(3) and section 4 of POTA and has erred in acquitting the accused persons under section 3(1) and 3(2)(a) of POTA.	Facts
Mr. Tushar Mehta learned Solicitor General has submitted that section 120B of IPC defines a criminal conspiracy as a distinct offence.	Facts
He has relied on as to criminal conspiracy by Dr. Sri Hari Singh Gour in his wellknown Commentary on Penal Law of India?, (Vol. 2, 11 th Edn.	Facts
Page 1138) summed up the legal position in the following words In order to constitute a single general conspiracy, there must be a common design.	Facts
Each conspirator plays his separate part in one integrated and united effort to achieve the common purpose.	Facts
Each one is aware that he has a part to play in a general conspiracy though he may not know all its secrets or the means by which the common purpose is to be accomplished.	Facts
The evil scheme may be promoted by a few, some may drop out and some may join at a later stage, but the conspiracy continues until it is broken up.	Facts

At pages 610611, observed as under the very agreement, the concert or league is the ingredient of the offence.	Facts
and that it is not necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every detail of the conspiracy.	Facts
It was then observed that there must be unity of object or purpose but there may be a plurality of means sometimes even unknown to one another, amongst the conspirators.	Facts

Facts
All of them cannot but be treated as conspirators.	Facts
Where in pursuance of the agreement the conspirators commit offences individually or adopt illegal means to do a legal act which has a nexus to the object of conspiracy, all of them will be liable for such offences even if some of them have not actively participated in the commission of those offences.	Facts
In the matter of Yakub Abdul Razak Memon vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2013) 13 SCC 1 , where a large number of accused were involved in a criminal conspiracy having played a distinct role, this Court held that where an accused allegedly transported weapons to the training centre, carried trainees, the question arises whether this amounted to overt acts contributing to common object of the conspiracy.	Facts
What is to be seen is that such an act formed a crucial part of the chain leading to creating terror, engaging in violence, or waging a war against State.	Facts

IN RE ANIL YADRAM (PW55) It was urged on behalf of the prosecution that PW55, Anil Yadram is a reliable eyewitness.	Arguments of Petitioner
His presence at the scene of occurrence at 7.30 a.m. and that of deceased is natural and stands proved.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that the presence of the eyewitness on the crime spot was natural as he used to keep his push handcart inside the compound of Chitty Bang in Thakorbhai Desai Hall, as the drive was on to remove such carts by Municipal Corporation.	Arguments of Petitioner
He was present in early morning hours and his presence has been corroborated and proved by PW55, owner of Chitty Bang CW1 who has confirmed that PW55 used to keep his hand cart in the Chitty Bang compound with his permission and used to sleep there at night.	Arguments of Petitioner
The version of PW55 has also been corroborated by medical evidence and by other independent evidence.	Arguments of Petitioner
His disposition has been corroborated by medical as well as ballistic expert, PWs.8, 15, 55, 101 and 120 with respect to the position of the accused and the bullet injury suffered by the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Post Mortem examination was conducted by 4 doctors.	Arguments of Petitioner
Dr. Pratik Patel (PW8) has proved 7 gunshots caused by 5 bullets.	Arguments of Petitioner
Forensic and biological reports prove the death of the deceased inside the car.	Arguments of Petitioner
The weapon used by A1 at the time of the commission of the offence was duly recovered from same flat.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ballistic expert PW75 has deposed that the bullets recovered from the body of the deceased were fired from the same revolver which was recovered at the instance of A1.	Arguments of Petitioner
Commission of offence visvis PW39, Jagdish Tiwari has attained finality as that has not been questioned by accused persons by filing appeals, which also proves the presence of A1 and A3 at Ahmedabad during the relevant period.	Arguments of Petitioner
PW95 proves that A1 was present in Ahmedabad on 27.3.2003 and used phone No.98254 91421 even up to the next day of the murder of the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court has committed gross perversity in setting aside the findings recorded by the trial court without coming to close quarters of the reasoning employed by the trial court as well as marshalling of evidence in detail, as done by the trial court.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused sought to discredit the testimony and deposition of PW55 Anil Yadram by raising various grounds to be dealt with in extenso hereinafter.	Arguments of Respondent
Anil Yadram, PW55 has stated that he stationed his handcart near Law Garden outside the gate of Chitty Bang, Thakorbhai Desai Hall, and Nanubhai is the owner of the Chitty Bang.	Arguments of Respondent
He used to leave his handcart in the compound of Chitty Bang of Nanubhai (CW1) during the night.	Arguments of Respondent
If the handcart is kept outside, the corporation might tow away the cart.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, he used to keep the handcart in the said Chitty Bang during the night.	Arguments of Respondent
He used to sleep in the Chitty Bang, the place of Nanubhai.	Arguments of Respondent
On 26.3.2003 he went to nature?s call, and after brushing he washed his face and came near the front gate and then he saw that Kanhaiya Lal was standing nearby the gate.	Arguments of Respondent
He told him that the Corporation was towing the handcarts.	Arguments of Respondent
Kanhayalal told him that he would be there at 10?O clock.	Arguments of Respondent
He was inside the gate of Chitty Bang when he saw a Maruti Fronti came from Gajjar Hall Cross Roadside and stopped where he kept his larry.	Arguments of Respondent
Haren Pandya was inside the car.	Arguments of Respondent
He parked the car and was rolling the window glass up.	Arguments of Respondent
In the meantime, a boy came from the side where the car had come and he fired 4 to 5 rounds.	Arguments of Respondent
The feet of Haren Pandya was raised up and he fell on the back side.	Arguments of Respondent
Witness shouted what are you doing?	Arguments of Respondent
The assaulter ran away.	Arguments of Respondent
Thereafter Ramesh, Sweeper came and asked what had happened.	Arguments of Respondent
The boy was neither here nor there.	Arguments of Respondent
He has specified some features of the accused.	Arguments of Respondent
He was scared and sat so for some time and then went towards B Desai Hall and saw Shukla Chacha in a rickshaw.	Arguments of Respondent
He informed Shukla Chacha that Haren Pandya has been killed.	Arguments of Respondent
Shukla Chacha and he both went in a rickshaw.	Arguments of Respondent
Since goods were loaded and as there was traffic police on Panchvati Circle, he dropped him off from rickshaw at Panchvati Circle and again asked him to board the rickshaw at Ambawadi Circle.	Arguments of Respondent
Then they reached Nanubhai?s place.	Arguments of Respondent
He informed Nanubhai that Haren Bhai Pandya has been killed by 4 to 5 rounds of firing at the place where he used to keep his larry.	Arguments of Respondent
Nanubhai told that after having tea he will reach Law Garden.	Arguments of Respondent
They went back to Law Garden, the police had arrived, Haren Pandya was taken in a jeep to V.N. Hospital.	Arguments of Respondent
The police officer came in civil dress and asked him features of the assaulter.	Arguments of Respondent
The witness explained him in the same manner as he has deposed in the court.	Arguments of Respondent
The CBI had prepared the map.	Arguments of Respondent
He has affixed his thumb impression and Kanhaiya has signed it.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted on behalf of the accused persons that the case of gun firing set up by the witness PW55 is not correct as in Maruti 800 car, no gunshot residue (GSR) has been found and no bullet has been recovered from the car.	Arguments of Respondent
It is not in dispute that the bullets were recovered from the body as such they were not found in the car.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel for A1 submitted that from the seat no blood was found though on Kurta and Pyjama and underwear there were blood stains.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court has observed that there was profuse bleeding, as such from the driver?s seat cover blood ought to have been found.	Arguments of Respondent
On the other hand, it was pointed out on behalf of the CBI that blood has been recovered from the Maruti car and it was of Group B of the deceased.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, merely on the cover of the seat blood was not found, would not discredit the incident.	Arguments of Respondent
As a matter of fact, it would depend upon the nature of the wound and whether the bleeding is internal and the position of the body as to how much blood would go down.	Arguments of Respondent
Whether it will go to the seat cover or to the bottom of the car, it cannot be said to be a universal formula that whenever an incident has happened in a car, blood should be found on a particular place.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, an attempt to discredit the deposition of the witness on the aforesaid ground that some blood has not been recovered from the seat cover of the car by itself, cannot be said to be circumstances leading to doubting of the incident in the car.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted on behalf of the prosecution that PW55 is an independent witness who is neither related to the deceased nor having any enmity with A1.	Arguments of Respondent
He has duly identified A1 in a test identification parade on 5.5.1981 before PW7 who has given Panchnama.	Arguments of Respondent
The trial court has rightly found him to be a reliable witness.	Arguments of Respondent
It was urged on behalf of the accused that there was no GSR inside or outside the vehicle which according to the accused makes it highly doubtful that the car was the site of the shooting.	Arguments of Respondent
The prosecution submitted that since the bullets were found inside the body, GSR could not be found inside or outside the vehicle.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, the incident cannot be said to be doubtful due to the fact that the presence of GSR has not been found inside or outside the vehicle.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused that the car had dark window glasses.	Arguments of Respondent
Driver?s right side was slightly open.	Arguments of Respondent
PW55 has also stated that the car window was open as shown in the photograph.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, it was submitted that by the opening of roughly 3 inches, gunshot injuries are rendered impossible, to be caused especially injury No.7, which renders it doubtful that the car was the site of the shooting.	Arguments of Respondent
PW55 has stated that Haren Pandya after stopping the car, drank water from the bottle and thereafter he was fired at when he was rolling up the window glass.	Arguments of Respondent
In our opinion, precise rolling of the glass when he was fired at, cannot be stated by any person with precision.	Reasoning
It is too much to expect a person to state how much rolling of the glass of windows had been done at the time of firing.	Reasoning
Even if the witness had stated so, that would be merely his guesswork.	Reasoning
When a person is rolling the glass up, it is possible that he might have been fired the shot when the window was quite wide open and when he was in the process of rolling it up.	Reasoning
The person in order to save himself from the firing would also try to roll up the glass with speed then also gunshot firing can be made in the process.	Reasoning
Thus the argument raised that there was a tiny opening of 3 inches when the shots were fired, is against the normal course of human conduct to make such statement and the way in which the incident has taken place it cannot be said with precision how much rolling of the glass of windows was done before firing took place and how much rolling was done after suffering some shots or in the process of firing.	Reasoning
It can only be said that he was in the process of rolling the glass up when the firing took place.	None
PW55 has demonstrated the position of the deceased inside the car in his deposition.	None
With respect to shooting from the driver?s side glass is corroborated medically by the direction of injuries 1 to 4 which are from upward to downward and right to left.	None
PW55 has further stated that the legs of deceased came up and he fell on the codriver?s seat which explains injury No. 7 also which is from downward to upward and left to right.	None
This is further corroborated by the entry hole in Pyjama which is in the rear hole of Pyjama.	None
The position of the deceased has been confirmed by PW85, a constable who took the body of the deceased out of the car.	None
PW85 has stated that legs were slightly up from knee level.	None
The right leg was slightly more on the upward direction.	None
To discredit version of PW55, it was submitted that there were 7 injuries and 5 bullet injuries were found.	Arguments of Respondent
Total 5 firearms bullets were recovered from the body of the deceased during post mortem as proved by PW8.	Arguments of Respondent
That falsifies the prosecution case.	Arguments of Respondent
This aspect requires a close examination of the evidence.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted on behalf of A1 that in the post mortem conducted by 4 doctors, 5 bullets described as white metal bullets were found from the body as against 7 gunshot wounds.	Arguments of Respondent
All of them had blackening around.	Arguments of Respondent
Injury No.6 also had blackening as found by PW19, the treating doctor.	Arguments of Respondent
The holes in the clothes corresponding to the blood wounds including the right bone show blackening.	Arguments of Respondent
The emergence of all 7 holes on the clothes including those on the right GSR and later examined by CFSL.	Arguments of Respondent
It was further submitted that autopsy surgeon PW8 has stated in answer to question Nos.64 to 66 that all the bullets inside the body are mentioned for 5 wounds namely injury Nos.1 to 4, 5 to 7.	Arguments of Respondent
Injury Nos. 5 and 6 in the post mortem report is their communicating injury.	Arguments of Respondent
The track of injuries 5 and 6 is not noted.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that in case of injury Nos.5 and 6, there should have been wrist fracture and the injury should have been on the palm region.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus the eye witness account of firing 5 shots is not reliable.	Arguments of Respondent
For causing injury No.7 the weapon would have to be at the level of the scrotum and to its left and the autopsy surgeon has stated that assailant to cause injury No.7 will have to be in front and beneath.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus injury No.7 could not have been caused in Maruti car.	Arguments of Respondent
So that is not the place of the incident.	Arguments of Respondent
Due to this aspect, the ocular evidence of PW 55 stands contradicted.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted on behalf of the prosecution that while countering that coherent and succinct nature of the medical and forensic evidence with ballistics bolsters the case of the prosecution and unambiguously establishes that murder was committed by A1.	Arguments of Petitioner
Injury Nos.2 to 4 were direct shots to the chest injury Nos.1, 5 and 6 were caused by the same bullet, injury No.1 was on the neck, injury No.5 on the righthand metallic bone and injury No.6 at back of the hand, injury Nos.5 and 6 are communicating injuries and thereafter injury No.1 has been caused in the neck by the same bullet.	Arguments of Petitioner
Statement of PW8, Dr. Pratik Patel has been relied upon who has stated that the same bullet has caused gunshot injuries 5 and 6.	Arguments of Petitioner
The doctor has opined that if the hand is reflexly kept in front of face or neck region on the right side that back of hand if facing the opposite side of the victim, the bullet may reenter from external injury No.1.	Arguments of Petitioner
Now we advert to whether medical evidence belies the version of PW55.	None
In the post mortem report D160 dated 26.3.2003 of Haren Pandya following injuries have been noted About 0.8 cm diameter, punch red contused lacerated entry wound with inverted edges is present on the lower part of front of neck on right side, about 1 cm above and 2 cm right to medial end of right clavicle.	None
Blackening is seen on skin surrounding the wound.	None
2. About 0.8 cm diameter, punch red contused lacerated entry wound with inverted edges is present in front of right chest, about 1.2 cm right to midplane over right 2 nd	None
intercostal space.	None
3. About 0.8 cm diameter, punch red contused lacerated entry wound with inverted edges is present on front of right chest, 5 cm below and 1 cm left to right nipple.	None
4. About 0.8 cm diameter, punch red contused lacerated entry wound with inverted edges is present front of right chest, 0.5 cm below and 3 cm right to abovementioned external injury no. 3. 5.	None
About 0.8 cm diameter, punch red contused lacerated entry wound with inverted edges is present on back of right hand, 2 cm proximal to junction of index and middle fingers.	None
Blackening of skin is seen surrounding the wound.	None
6.	None
Lacerated wound with everted margin is present on front of right forearm at junction of upper 2/3 to lower 1/3rd, gobliquely downward to medially, 2 cm.	None
7. 0.5 cm diameter, circular punch lacerated wound with inverted margins present on lower part of left scrotum 1 cm midplane (scrotal raphe) covered with clot.	None
8. 0.4 cm x 0.4 cm, redcolored, abrasion present on mid of lateral aspect of phalanx of the right middle finger.	None
When we consider the aforesaid report, injury No.1 is on the lower part of the front of the neck on the right side, that is on the right clavicle.	None
The doctor has clearly expressed that injury Nos.5 and 6 are communicating ones.	Reasoning
As a matter of fact, in communicating injuries it is not necessary that the bullet to have entered the proximal to junction of the index and middle finger.	Reasoning
It could have passed touching the area and then caused injury on the right forearm in the process of reaching right up to the front on a lower part of the front to cause injury No.1.	Reasoning
The medical evidence clearly establishes that injury No.5 was caused first, 6 thereafter and No.7 was ultimately caused by the same bullet and doctor has clearly explained it.	Reasoning
While replying to question No.14, the doctor said that if the hand is reflexly kept in front of neck region on the right side and that back of the hand is facing the opposite side of the victim, bullet injury No.1 may be caused after causing injury Nos.5 and 6.	Reasoning
The conclusion of the High Court is only right to the extent that injury Nos.5 and 6 could not be said to be entry and exit wounds.	None
They were rather communicating wounds caused in the process of causing injury No.1.	Reasoning
The conclusion to the contrary averred by the High Court as to independent injuries is absolutely incorrect.	Reasoning
Testimony of PW55 cannot be said to be falsified on the basis of aforesaid medical evidence.	Reasoning
There is no inconsistency with respect to the aforesaid aspect in the medical version and the ocular version of PW55.	None
PW8, Dr. Pratik Patel, Autopsy Surgeon has further stated in answer to question No.73	None
Question no.	None
73 what would be the exception and what is the authority of considering the exception?	None
Answer	None
If first entry and exit are through the small part of the body and soft tissue and side of the reentry are in the close proximity of the exit wound of the first entry wound then there may be features of the entry wound on the re entry wound.	None
I can also show some statements in support of my reply.	None
There is a book on Medico legal statements in support of my reply.	None
There is a book on Medicolegal investigation of Gun Shot by Abdulla Fateh, J.B. Lipping Company.	None
It is apparent from the aforesaid answer that wound has been referred by doctor PW8 as a small part of the body and soft tissue.	None
Thus, it is a communicating injury of soft tissue not piercing through or entering the wrist.	Reasoning
It is clear that injuries 5 and 6 are communicating injuries and injury No.1 has been caused by the same bullet.	Reasoning
The entry and exit wounds have been seen and explained by the doctor in the aforesaid manner which has to be communicating one only caused by the same bullet.	Reasoning
It was also urged that the account of a number of injuries of the bullet is not matching with the number of injuries found.	Reasoning
There were 7 gunshot wounds whereas 5 bullets were recovered from the body of the deceased.	Reasoning
As already explained 5 bullet injuries were caused as suggested by ocular evidence of PW55 and also by medical evidence that 5 bullets were found as injury Nos.5 and 6 were communicating injuries leading ultimately to injury No.1 as discussed above.	Reasoning
Thus, there is no inconsistency rather ocular evidence is fortified by the medical evidence.	Reasoning
The accused person has relied upon Grays Anatomy and A Colour Atlas of Human Anatomy to contend that there are 32 tightly packed bones in the palm.	Reasoning
The tightest packed are wrist bones and the carpal tunnel is just about 8.3 mm in depth (as per medical journals).	Reasoning
A 0.32 caliber bullet has a diameter of 7.65 mm.	Reasoning
Therefore, in the absence of any credible competent forensic explanation of the track of injuries 5 and 6, this theory set up by CBI at the stage of arguments, is liable to be dismissed.	Reasoning
There is no dispute that the palm has tightly packed bones.	Reasoning
In the instant case, as the bullet has not entered inside and only touched the soft tissue in injury No.5, the injury was caused on the soft tissue and then it has superficially touched the wrist.	Reasoning
The doctor has stated in para 8 that external injuries 5 and 6 were found communicating with each other.	Reasoning
Fracture of 2 nd right metacarpal bone was present.	Reasoning
He has further stated that bullets were made of white metal, they were sealed, labelled and handed over to the police officer on duty.	Reasoning
When the treating doctor was asked how there were 5 bullets and 6 entry wounds, he has opined that one injury will be of the entry of the bullet and that was precisely the communicating injuries 5 and 6 leading to injury No.1 that was the reentry wound.	Reasoning
Whether injury No.1 was original or reentry, he has referred to post mortem report to opine that injury Nos.5 and 6 are communicating injuries.	Reasoning
The High Court as well confused as to the number of injuries on the basis of 7 wounds and 5 number of bullets fired.	Reasoning
In case of such communicating injuries, it is not necessary that the bullet should enter any part of the body while reaching to the last injury, it may cause scratch or touched the small part of the body or soft tissue as has been done in the instant case.	Reasoning
It has happened in the instant case.	None
With respect to the significance of such a medical version, this Court in Rachhpal Singh and Anr.	None
vs. State of Punjab, AIR 2002 SC 2710 , has observed thus ?	None
8.	None
A perusal of the evidence of the doctor shows that there is some discrepancy in his evidence in regard to the nature of the injury on the deceased as to whether the edges of the wound were averted or inverted.	None
But this, in our opinion, is not fatal to the case of the prosecution.	None
The doctor while admitting that there was some such confusion in his evidence as well as the post mortem report, in our opinion, has clarified the said position during the course of his examination, though belatedly.	None
From the very nature of the wounds found on the body of the deceased, it is clear that they died of gunshot injuries which is not seriously disputed.	None
What is being disputed by the learned counsel is the points of entry and exit which on facts of this case, would make a very little difference since the other evidence adduced by the prosecution clearly shows that the deceased died out of gunshot injuries.	None
Some discrepancy as to the nature of entry and exit on facts of this case would not make the prosecution case any weaker.	None
It is more so because of the facts that the casings of the bullets which were recovered by the Investigating Officer were positively proved by the ballistic expert as of those bullets which were discharged from the weapons recovered from the appellants and these casings having been found near the bodies of the deceased on the roof of their house would establish that the deceased died of bullets discharged from the weapons seized from the appellants.	None
In such circumstances, the question of entry or exit of the wounds would lose its significance if the presence of the accused persons with these weapons at the place and time is otherwise established by the prosecution.?	None
(emphasis supplied Reference has also been made on Modis jurisprudence.	None
With respect to the path of the bullet inside the body in which the following observations have been made ?while searching for a bullet, it must be borne in mind that it could take a very erratic and unusual course while passing through the body.	None
With respect to the determination of the direction from which the weapon was fired, it further states as under The question regarding the direction of fire, whether from right to left or from front to back is of medicolegal importance.	None
To ascertain this, it is necessary to know the position of the victim at the time of the discharge of the bullet, when a straight line is drawn between the entrance and exit wounds and prolonged in front generally indicates the line of direction.	None
In some cases, it is difficult to determine the direction as the bullet is so often deflected by the tissues that its course is very irregular, also when the bullet wobbles.?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
Though it has been observed that in some cases it is difficult to determine a direction but in the instant case considering the fact that the injuries are only on the right side which is on drivers side, 3 wounds were caused on the chest and injury Nos.1, 5 and 6 were caused by the same bullet obviously fired from the drivers side window only as is apparent from the direction of communicating injuries also.	Reasoning
There is no inconsistency in ocular and medical evidence in the instant case.	Reasoning
It was submitted on behalf of the learned counsel appearing for the accused that PW55 has contradicted himself on the position of Haren Pandya?s body inside the car.	Arguments of Respondent
In his examinationinchief he makes an improvement ?pug upar thayi gay ahata?	Arguments of Respondent
and that he had fallen on his back vasa na taraf .	Arguments of Respondent
This is an improvement to counter PW8?s forensic opinion that the weapon would have to be below the scrotum.	Arguments of Respondent
On this count of improvement alone, PW55 should be discredited.	Arguments of Respondent
He has not said that in his CBI statement or to the police that Pug upar thayi gay ahata.	Arguments of Respondent
This Court in Sukhdeep Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr., 2010 (2) SCC 177 , this Court has observed thus ?	None
17.	None
We find, therefore, that the very basis of the argument raised by the learned counsel on the basis of the statement of Dr. C.P. Srivastava that the injuries could not have been caused while the deceased was in a standing posture is not borne out from the crossexamination.	None
Even otherwise, we believe that it would be impossible for any witness to give a categorical statement as to the posture that the deceased or the assailants were holding at the time when the firing incident happened.	None
The trial court was not justified in coming to a contrary conclusion as it appears to be a case of misreading of the evidence.?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
It was further submitted that in the police statement PW55 has stated that Haren Pandya collapsed on the front seat then speaks of Shri Pandya having fallen on the driver?s seat.	Arguments of Respondent
Later speaks about his falling on the adjacent seat.	Arguments of Respondent
CW1 has stated that ?car mein ulte hoke pade hue hain?.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that he first says on the question whether he could see knees below steering in the car, PW55 has replied that he could see a part of the chest and knee.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that when injury No.7 has been caused, the weapon could be below the level of his scrotum to his left.	Arguments of Respondent
Weapon pointing upwards when PW55 has stated that the shooting happened from outside from the small opening, he stands discredited by the medical evidence.	Arguments of Respondent
It was further urged on behalf of the accused that the submission of CBI that left leg of the deceased came up the injury No.7 is impossible version, cannot be believed.	Arguments of Respondent
In our opinion, from the statement of PW55 it is clear that when Haren Pandya fell in the car, his leg came up.	Reasoning
Obviously, the left leg would come up towards the drivers side and where the injury is caused to him, obviously it would be in the same direction and travel the same way it has travelled.	Reasoning
The same is the statement of witness PW55 made in the examinationinchief cannot be said to be an improvement.	Reasoning
He has stated what he has seen.	Reasoning
It is not necessary to state every minute details in the statement under section 161 Cr.P.C.	Reasoning
It is not for the autopsy doctor to give a vivid description as to how the deceased reacted at the time when gunshots were fired upon him as he was not an eye witness.	Reasoning
In view of the evidence on record, the statement made by PW55, the direction of causing of injury No. 7 is fully explained and an eye witness cannot be said to state all these details with mathematical precision.	Reasoning
Question is whether he is otherwise reliable and whether other evidence corroborates him.	Reasoning
Corroborating evidence is available in abundance.	Reasoning
As to the precise distance inchwise position at the time of firing, there is no witness who can give an exact description as suggested in a lengthy crossexamination.	Reasoning
Lengthy crossexamination on this line was wholly uncalled for and wholly unnecessary and witness is not supposed to furnish all such details with precision.	Reasoning
Though the witness has withstood the test of crossexamination also.	Reasoning
The deposition of PW55 was sought to be further discredited on the ground that when feet came up, he could not refer to the position of knees with reference to the steering.	None
The witness is not supposed to give all these minute details.	None
It is not a case where medical evidence completely improbabilises the ocular evidence only on that case the ocular evidence has to be discarded not otherwise.	None
Reliance has been placed on behalf of accused on Abdul Sayeed v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2010 (10) SCC 259 thus	None
Thus, the position of law in cases where there is a contradiction between medical evidence and ocular evidence can be crystallised to the effect that though the ocular testimony of a witness has greater evidentiary value visvis medical evidence, when medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor in the process of the evaluation of evidence.	None
However, where the medical evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.?	None

In Nallapati Sivaiah v. SubDivisional Officer, Guntur, A.P., 2007 (15) SCC 465	None
the court observed ?	None
52.	None
The dying declaration must inspire confidence so as to make it safe to act upon.	None
Whether it is safe to act upon a dying declaration depends upon not only the testimony of the person recording the dying declarationbe it even a Magistrate but also all the material available on record and the circumstances including the medical evidence.	None
The evidence and the material available on record must be properly weighed in each case to arrive at a proper conclusion.	None
The court must satisfy itself that the person making the dying declaration was conscious and fit to make statement for which purposes not only the evidence of persons recording the dying declaration but also cumulative effect of the other evidence including the medical evidence and the circumstances must be taken into consideration.?

In State of Rajasthan v. Bhanwar Singh, 2004 (13) SCC 147 the Court observed ?	None
6.	None
We find that the High Court has carefully analysed the factual position.	None
Though, individually some of the circumstances may not have affected veracity of the prosecution version, the combined effect of the infirmities noticed by the High Court is sufficient to show that the prosecution case has not been established.	None
The presence of PWs 3, 4 and 8 at the alleged spot of incident has been rightly considered doubtful in view of the categorical statement of PW 5, the widow that she sent for these persons to go and find the body of her husband.	None
It is quite unnatural that PWs 3, 4 and 8 remained silent after witnessing the assaults.	None
They have not given any explanation as to what they did after witnessing the assault on the deceased.	None
Additionally, the unexplained delay of more than one day in lodging the FIR casts serious doubt on the truthfulness of the prosecution version.	None
The mere delay in lodging the FIR may not prove fatal in all cases.	None
But on the circumstances of the present case, certainly, it is one of the factors which corrodes credibility of the prosecution version.	None
Finally, the medical evidence was at total variance with the ocular evidence.	None
Though ocular evidence has to be given importance over medical evidence, where the medical evidence totally improbabilises the ocular version that can be taken to be a factor to affect credibility of the prosecution version.	None
The view taken by the High Court is a possible view.	None
The appeal being one against acquittal, we do not consider this to be a fit case where any interference is called for.	None
The appeal fails and is dismissed.?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
In this case, it cannot be said that ocular evidence is belied by the medical evidence.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also submitted on behalf of the accused that when the eye witness made an improvement to suit medical evidence which has come on record by itself, it is sufficient to discredit him.	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance has been placed on Shingara Singh v. State of Haryana Anr., 2003 (12) SCC 758 in which this Court has observed ?	None
22.	None
In our view, the High Court has completely missed the significance of the finding recorded by the trial court.	None
The trial court found that in the FIR as also the statements recorded under Section 161 CrPC the witnesses had clearly mentioned that both the appellants had climbed on top of the wall and from there Shingara Singh, A2 fired at Surinder Singh.	Arguments of Respondent
If this version were to be accepted, the injury caused would not have been of the nature found by the Medical Officer who was clearly of the opinion, having regard to the trajectory of injuries, that the person firing the firearm was at a lower level than the victim.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, with a view to bring their case in consonance with the medical evidence on record, all the three witnesses made significant changes while deposing in court and all of them thereafter consistently stated that while A1 had climbed on top of the wall A2 stood on the ladder in such a manner that only his face was visible from across the wall and while standing in that position, keeping the barrel of the gun on the wall and without resting the butt of the gun against his shoulder, he fired at the deceased.	Arguments of Respondent
There was no dispute that their deposition in court was consistent, but what was observed by the trial court was that their version as to the manner of occurrence as deposed to by them was at variance with what was stated in the first information report by PW 5, and in the statements of PWs 6 and 7 recorded under Section 161 CrPC.	Arguments of Respondent
When confronted with their earlier statements, they could not give a satisfactory explanation, with the result that their credibility was sufficiently impeached.	Arguments of Respondent
The change of version by each one of them, and to the same effect, was deliberate and not merely accidental or on account of lapse of memory.	Arguments of Respondent
It cannot be disputed that this was a very significant change.	Arguments of Respondent
It cannot also be disputed that the change was deliberately made by all the witnesses so that the prosecution case became consistent with the medical evidence on record.	Arguments of Respondent
We, therefore, do not find any error committed by the trial court in coming to this conclusion.?	None
(emphasis supplied) Reliance has also been placed by learned counsel for the accused on Ram Narain Singh v. State of Punjab, 1975 (4) SCC 497 in which this Court has observed ?	None
2.	None
We might also mention here that the definite case of the prosecution before the Sessions Judge was that while the shot was fired at the deceased Teja Singh by Ram Narain Singh he had kept the right hand flexed on his chest.	Arguments of Respondent
It was thus stated by the eyewitnesses that at the time of firing, the deceased had put his right hand on his chest.	Arguments of Respondent
These two additions or embellishments appear to us to have been necessitated in order to bring the evidence of the eyewitnesses in consonance with the evidence of the doctor as also that of the ballistic expert, and we shall deal with this aspect of the matter a little later.	Arguments of Respondent
xxx	None
xxx xxx 6.	None
This particular posture was undoubtedly a most conspicuous fact which could not have been missed by the witness if it was really there.	Arguments of Respondent
In these circumstances, therefore, we should have expected this fact to be mentioned in the FIR but it is conspicuously absent from the FIR, nor was this fact mentioned by either Surjit Singh or his brother Joginder Singh in their statements before the police or before the committing Magistrate.	Arguments of Respondent
It seems to us that the theory of the deceased having placed his arm on the right side of his chest has been introduced only after the doctor who was examined as the second witness in the Sessions Court stated in his examinationinchief that if the elbow of right arm is flexed lying in front of the chest, then injuries Nos. 1 to 4 could be caused with a single firearm discharge.	Arguments of Respondent
It would appear that this witness was examined before the Sessions Court on May 14, 1973, and PW Surjit Singh was examined on the same day after the evidence of the doctor was recorded.	Arguments of Respondent
PWs Surjit Singh and Joginder Singh had to introduce the theory of the deceased having put his right arm on his chest to bring the occurrence in tune and in consonance with the evidence of the doctor.	Arguments of Respondent
This was undoubtedly a belated idea because if it had been a fact there is no reason why the eyewitnesses should not have deposed to it in their statements before the police or even before the committing court.	Arguments of Respondent
Till that time the witnesses were not aware of the injuries said to have been caused to the deceased Ram Narain Singh by a single fire unless the deceased was in a particular posture.	Arguments of Respondent
This fact came to light for the first time when the doctor was examined in the Sessions Court and the witnesses in order to corroborate their testimony with the evidence of the doctor introduced this embellishment in the story of the assault on the deceased.	Arguments of Respondent
Considered against this background, the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that the evidence of the eyewitnesses was inconsistent with the medical evidence appears to be well founded.	Arguments of Respondent
In other words, the position is that if we discard this part of the evidence of the eyewitnesses which has come to light for the first time in the Sessions Court, then according to medical evidence, the deceased would have got two gunshots whereas it was never the prosecution case that Ram Narain Singh or any other accused fired a second shot at the deceased at any time.	Arguments of Respondent
The medical evidence, therefore, clearly falsifies the prosecution case regarding the manner in which the deceased was hit.?	None
(emphasis supplied) Counsel for the accused further submitted that there is an inconsistency between the ocular and medical evidence which will destroy the prosecution case, the benefit of which must go to defence.	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance has been placed on Ram Narain Singh (supra) in which this Court has observed Where the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution is totally inconsistent with the medical evidence or the evidence of the ballistic expert, this is a most fundamental defect in the prosecution case and unless reasonably explained it is sufficient to discredit the entire case.	Arguments of Respondent
In Mohinder Singh v. State, AIR 1953 SC 415 , this Court observed in similar circumstances as follows ?	None
In a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are alleged to have been caused.	Arguments of Respondent
It is elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case, it is doubtful whether the injuries which are attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle.?	None
It is obvious that where the direct evidence is not supported by the expert evidence, then the evidence is wanting in the most material part of the prosecution case and it would be difficult to convict the accused on the basis of such evidence.	None
While appreciating the evidence of the witnesses, the High Court does not appear to have considered this important aspect, but readily accepted the prosecution case without noticing that the evidence of the eyewitnesses in the Court was a belated attempt to improve their testimony and bring the same in line with the doctor?s evidence with a view to support an incorrect case.?	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance has been placed as to inconsistency between medical and ocular evidence by Counsel for accused on State of Haryana v. Ram Singh, 2002 (2) SCC 426 in which this Court has observed ?	None
1.	None
While it is true that the postmortem report by itself is not a substantive piece of evidence, but the evidence of the doctor conducting the postmortem can by no means be ascribed to be insignificant.	None
The significance of the evidence of the doctor lies visvis the injuries appearing on the body of the deceased person and likely use of the weapon therefor and it would then be the prosecutor?s duty and obligation to have the corroborative evidence available on record from the other prosecution witnesses.	Arguments of Respondent
xxx	None
xxx xxx 8.	None
The principal contention raised in support of the appeal filed on behalf of the accused persons has been that medical evidence as is available on record, completely demolished the prosecution case?	None
In Ram Narain Singh (supra) the Court observed that the prosecution has to prove that injury was caused by the weapon in the manner as alleged.	Reasoning
There is no dispute with the aforesaid proposition.	Reasoning
However, the applicability of ratio has to be seen in the facts and circumstances of each case.	Reasoning
In the instant case, the ocular evidence of PW55 is not discredited by the medical evidence.	Reasoning
Even otherwise as submitted on behalf of the prosecution that in case of any discrepancy between the ocular or medical evidence, the ocular evidence shall prevail, as observed in Yogesh Singh v. Mahabeer Singh Ors., (2017) 11 SCC 195 ?43.	None
The learned counsel appearing for the respondents has then tried to create a dent in the prosecution story by pointing out inconsistencies between the ocular evidence and the medical evidence.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, we are not persuaded with this submission since both the courts below have categorically ruled that the medical evidence was consistent with the ocular evidence and we can safely say that to that extent, it corroborated the direct evidence proffered by the eyewitnesses.	Arguments of Petitioner
We hold that there is no material discrepancy in the medical and ocular evidence and there is no reason to interfere with the judgments of the courts below on this ground.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any event, it has been consistently held by this Court that the evidentiary value of medical evidence is only corroborative and not conclusive and, hence, in case of a conflict between oral evidence and medical evidence, the former is to be preferred unless the medical evidence completely rules out the oral evidence.

In Kapildeo Mandal v. State of Bihar, (2008) 16 SCC 99 , all the eyewitnesses had categorically stated that the deceased was injured by the use of firearm, whereas the medical evidence specifically indicated that no firearm injury was found on the deceased.	None
This Court held that while appreciating variance between medical evidence and ocular evidence, oral evidence of eyewitnesses has to get priority as medical evidence is basically opinionative.	None
But, when the evidence of the eyewitnesses is totally inconsistent with the evidence given by the medical experts then evidence is appreciated in a different perspective by the courts.	None
It was observed that when medical evidence specifically rules out the injury claimed to have been inflicted as per the eyewitnesses version, then the court can draw adverse inference that the prosecution version is not trustworthy.	None
This judgment is clearly attracted to the present case.?	None

This Court rejected the medical evidence and upheld the view of the trial court (and the High Court) that the testimony of the eyewitnesses supported by other evidence would prevail over the postmortem report and testimony of the doctor.	None
It was held (SCC p. 286, para 41) ?	None
41.	None
The trial court has rightly ignored the deliberate lapses of the investigating officer as well as the postmortem report prepared by Dr. C.N. Tewari.	None
The consistent statement of the eyewitnesses which were fully supported and corroborated by other witnesses, and the investigation of the crime, including recovery of lathis, inquest report, recovery of the pagri of one of the accused from the place of occurrence, immediate lodging of FIR and the deceased succumbing to his injuries within a very short time, establish the case of the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.	None
These lapses on the part of PW 3 doctor and PW 6 investigating officer are a deliberate attempt on their part to prepare reports and documents in a designedly defective manner which would have prejudiced the case of the prosecution and resulted in the acquittal of the accused, but for the correct approach of the trial court to do justice and ensure that the guilty did not go scotfree.	None
The evidence of the eyewitness which was reliable and worthy of credence has justifiably been relied upon by the court.??	None
(emphasis supplied) With respect to track of bullet for injury No. 7 much was argued.	Reasoning
As already stated in Modi?s Jurisprudence, the track of bullet may take a different course once the injury has been caused.	Reasoning
Bullet may ricochet inside the body after causing the injury.	Reasoning
In view of entry wound as explained in Modi?s jurisprudence too much cannot be made out of the direction when the injury could have been caused in the method and manner suggested by PW55.	Reasoning
The High Court while appreciating injury No.7 has not considered the fact that Haren Pandya fell down inside on adjoining seat and his left leg came up as stated by the witness.	Reasoning
The High Court has simply proceeded on the basis that the victim was sitting on the driver?s seat or was sliding on to the adjoining seat.	Reasoning
The aforesaid material part of the statement of witness makes it clear how the injury was caused.	Reasoning
It was also urged that the mobile phone of Mr. Pandya was not investigated.	Reasoning
In our opinion, it was not necessary at all in the facts of the case.	Reasoning
It is not disputed that he had left the house in the morning to walk It was urged that no fingerprints were lifted from the car or from the weapon recovered afterward and shoes were not recovered.	Reasoning
In our opinion, it was not a case of a coldblooded murder where there was no eye witness.	Reasoning
Thus, when the accused has not touched the car, taking fingerprints from the car was not at all necessary and the weapon of offence has also been recovered from the accused.	Reasoning
It was not necessary after quite some time when its recovery was made to lift the fingerprints from it.	Reasoning
Merely nonrecovery of shoes of deceased from the hospital where a large number of persons had gathered by itself is not enough to discredit prosecution case.	Reasoning
The High Court in para 16 has observed that negligible blood was found near the driver?s seat.	Reasoning
The clothes of the deceased bore tell tale signs of profuse bleeding from injuries on his neck and forearm and mobile phone and keys lying under the seat had stains of blood.	Reasoning
Thus, it is apparent that there was blood on the seat as well as on the mobile phone and keys which were lying on the floor.	Reasoning
As eye witness has clearly stated the position where he was.	Reasoning
He has been crossexamined at length, blood on cloth was found, how much, where it was found is not going to discredit the ocular version and an entire incident.	Reasoning
When questioned about the blood, PW8 has answered, it would depend whether haemorrhage was internal or external.	Reasoning
If there is internal haemorrhage there would not be much blood outside.	Reasoning
The volume of the blood on the spot would depend upon the type of injuries.	Reasoning
Out of 7 bullet injuries, 6 were internal wounds, and on the forearm where minimum or less blood is possible, it was external.	Reasoning
In answer to question No.111, the doctor has stated.	Reasoning
The High Court has mostly proceeded on the basis that there should have been more blood found in the Maruti car.	Reasoning
As already discussed, it would depend upon the injury whether it was internal bleeding and how a person is lying, it can also spill on the clothes and fact remains blood has also been recovered from the Maruti car.	Reasoning
It is not necessary for how much quantity it should have been recovered.	Reasoning
It was found on mobile phone also and keys as observed by the High Court.	Reasoning
Following facts supports that the incident has taken place as suggested by PW55.	None
Ex. 160	None

The evidence of Satyam Patel, PW4 (Panch Witness) who deposed that blood was seen on the seat at the relevant time which was rubbed with a small pellet of cotton which was sent to the laboratory.	None
The PM report would indicate that there was a lot of blood in the thoracic cavity to the tune of 2.2 litres.	None
Ex. 457, 458 and 169 Panchnama of the clothes would indicate that the clothes had B group blood.	None
Besides PW85, R Sharma, Constable has also stated that at the time when deceased was taken to the hospital, there was no bleeding from his body.	None
The post mortem was conducted on 26.3.2003.	None
Time, therefore, is stated to be 5 to 6 hours before post mortem which comes around 8 a.m. and tallies with the version of PW55.	None
It was submitted that the FIR was not lodged by PW55.	Reasoning
The police control room was informed by IGP Mr. Suman.	Reasoning
Thus, the conduct of PW55 does not inspire confidence, he was not an eye witness.	Reasoning
In our opinion, Anil Yadram, PW55 had gone to inform the factum of the incident to the owner of Chitty Bang, Mr. Nanubhai S Wala (CW1) at Desai Hall.	Reasoning
It is not uncommon for a person to react in the manner PW55 has done.	Reasoning
He first wanted to inform the owner of the place as to the murder of Haren Pandya.	Reasoning
He was not a literate person.	Reasoning
71 .	None
CW1 has also supported the version of PW55, the narration of incident to CW1 by PW55 is quite natural and inspire confidence and there is due corroboration of the version by CW1 Nanubhai.	Reasoning
In the circumstances, nonproduction of Shukla Chacha who had simply given the lift in a rickshaw to Anil Yadram, PW55 and has taken him to the house of CW1, Nanubhai does not cause any dent in the prosecution version.	Reasoning
Merely on the ground of nonexamination of the witness Kanhaiya, the deposition of PW55 cannot be discarded.	Reasoning
By the time PW55 came back to the spot police had already arrived and the body of the deceased was taken in another vehicle to the hospital.	Reasoning
Anil Yadram has stated to Nanubhai CW1 that Haren Pandya had been shot dead and ?	Reasoning
woh gadi mein ulte hokar ke pade hain?	Reasoning
and he had seen the accused taking to their heels.	Reasoning
It could not be said from the deposition of PW55 that he had received the information of the incident, in fact, he has given a vivid description as eye witness noted PW55 or CW1 had no illwill or malice against the accused.	Reasoning
It does not make any difference whether Nanubhai CW1 was examined as a court witness or as a prosecution witness.	Reasoning
Once a witness has been examined, his evidentiary value has to be considered in accordance with the law.	Reasoning
Once he has been examined no question to draw any adverse inference against the prosecution arises.	Reasoning
It was submitted that CW1 had attempted to shrink the timeline by stating that PW55 came at around 9.15 a.m. instead of 9.45 a.m.	Reasoning
On a rough estimate of time, no adverse inference can be drawn as to the correctness of the version by the aforesaid witness.	Reasoning
Estimation of time may differ by some margin when a statement is made in court after years together.	Reasoning
Merely by the fact that CW1 asked PW55 twice whether he had seen the incident, he said yes he had seen the incident twice.	Reasoning
That does not cause any dent in the prosecution case and does not render the statement of PW55 doubtful in any manner.	Reasoning
We find no embellishment or material improvement in the courts statement as compared to the one recorded under section 161 Cr.P.C.	Reasoning
The question of whether CW1 had asked PW55 whether he was speaking the truth and omission of that in the statement under section 161 cannot be said to be a material omission.	Reasoning
Material facts have been stated in the statement and there is no contradiction with respect to the material facts with the statement under section 161 Cr.P.C. as to the approximation of time also nothing can be made out by the accused.	Reasoning
The argument was raised on behalf of A1 that PW55 did not mention in the examinationinchief the time of the incident at around 7.30 a.m.	Reasoning
He admitted that he does not have a watch.	Reasoning
No one can tell the correct time.	Reasoning
How by the aforesaid statement any benefit can be derived by the accused, passes comprehension as it is not uncommon that various persons do not keep a watch and they go by rough estimation of the time.	Reasoning
It was not necessary to speak about the time of occurrence in the examinationinchief nonetheless it has been brought about in the crossexamination.	Reasoning
There is nothing to disbelieve the estimation of time made in the crossexamination.	Reasoning
Time assessment may differ in some duration.	Reasoning
It was urged that as far as the time consumed by PW55 is concerned, the incident had not taken place at 7.30 a.m., the submission is futile.	Reasoning
As urged, in which condition the deceased was taken to the hospital, is not material whether sitting or lying.	Reasoning
He was taken to the hospital when he was already dead.	Reasoning
It was urged that the conduct of PW55 is inconsistent with that of an eye witness.	Reasoning
The witness should have contacted to the regular walkers in the Law Garden.	Reasoning
He did not go to the Law Garden.	Reasoning
It is not likely that he had witnessed the incident.	Reasoning
He has stated that he was too scared to go to the police and stated to Shukla Chacha that he wanted to tell the police.	Reasoning
In our opinion, overall conduct of the witness is not unnatural considering the person belongs to poor strata of the society and decided to inform the owner of the Chitty Bang where his cart was parked, is not common and is very usual conduct in the course of normal human conduct.	Reasoning
It was submitted that on the basis of the statement of PW 55 sketch Ex. 620 was prepared.	Reasoning
There is crucial variance with the description recorded under section 161 Cr.PC.	Reasoning
The descriptive features mentioned by him are not even reflected in the sketch.	Reasoning
PW55?s deposition cannot be discredited or tainted in any manner by faulty preparation of sketch.	Reasoning
Even otherwise the evidence of sketch is not of much significance.	Reasoning
Sometime the sketch may not tally with the version given by a witness.	Reasoning
The High Court is moved by sketch Ex. 620 which was drawn.	None
PW55 denied any knowledge of such a sketch.	None
The sketch was not put to PW55 in the crossexamination and to obtain his explanation whether it tallied with the assailant.	None
In the absence of cross examination of PW55 on this aspect, the defence cannot take any advantage of a discrepancy, if any.	None
I.O. PW120 has stated that Ex. 620 was prepared in the absence of PW55, Anil Yadram Patel.	None
It was drawn only on the basis of his statement recorded under section 161 Cr.PC the way in which sketch was drawn it cannot be considered reliable and trustworthy sketch.	None
In the circumstances, sketch in the reference of the accused ought not to have weighed with the High Court because it was prepared in the absence of PW55.	None
PW101 has stated that he got the sketch map prepared on the basis of the description and handed over it to Mr. A.A. Chauhan, Police Inspector, Crime Branch.	None
In view of the identification made by the witness in the test identification parade, no dent is caused by the socalled sketch in the ocular evidence of PW55.	Reasoning
Considering the intricate nature of the investigation, we find that there was no undue delay in holding the T.I.P.	Reasoning
It was held on 5.5.2003 after 20 days of the arrest of the accused.	Reasoning
The accused had been identified in the same.	Reasoning
Jagdish Tiwari (PW39) also, later on, had rightly identified A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) as the assailant.	Reasoning
The decision relied upon in Subash and Shiv Shankar v. State of U.P. 1987 (3) SCC 331 wherein the test identification parade was done after 3 weeks.	Reasoning
In the facts of the said case, the identification was disbelieved.	Reasoning
The decision is distinguishable and turns on its own facts and circumstances.	Reasoning
It is the duty of the High Court to examine the details of the intrinsic merit of the evidence of eyewitnesses.	Reasoning
As observed by this Court in State of U.P. v. Sahai Ors., AIR 1981 SC 1442 , PW55 has been crossexamined repeatedly on the same question as to Maruti Fronti came from Gajjar Hall Cross Road side which he withstood.	Reasoning
The reason employed by the High Court that the presence of PW55 at the gate at 7.30 a.m. (sharp) is doubtful, is also wrong as he was there because he had parked his hand cart in the Chitty Bang and the fact is corroborated by CW1, Nanubhai who was known to him for the last 15 years.	Reasoning
The timeframe employed by the High Court with respect to the witness travelling time that he should have come back at 10.30 a.m. and not at 11 a.m. is based on estimation as if PW55 was not a witness but was an accused.	Reasoning
The version of the witness is not shaken by the aforesaid aspect.	Reasoning
The timing stated by the witness is by estimation as he did not carry the watch.	Reasoning
The High Court has adopted hypertechnical approach in assessing the evidence and has been moved by minor discrepancies which do not go to heart of the matter and shake the basic version of the prosecution witness, as held in Vijay Chinee v. State of M.P. 2010 (8) SCC 191 , and Bhajan Singh Harbhajan Singh Ors.	Reasoning
v. State of Haryana (2011)	Reasoning
7	Reasoning
SCR 1.	Reasoning
The High Court is also moved by the fact that PW55 claims to have seen the kurta of Mr. Pandya and stated the colour of stripes of kurta as brown whereas stripes of kurta were red in colour.	Reasoning
There can be confusion in identification of the colour of the kurta and memory may also fade after several years and there is not much difference between red and brown.	Reasoning
It is a minor discrepancy which has weighed with the High Court whereas it ought to have been ignored.	Reasoning
IN RE WHETHER BULLETS ARE THE SAME AS RECOVERED IN POST MORTEM	None
It was also submitted on behalf of A1 that bullet recovered was not sent for ballistic examination and bullets produced in court differ in colour and the state of deformation recorded during post mortem.	Reasoning
However, it is clear that it was not put to the doctor that the bullets which were produced in the court, were not the same which he has recovered.	Reasoning
It was further submitted on behalf of the accused that the colour depends on whether it is a pure lead bullet or a bullet with a lead core covered by a jacket of zinc.	Reasoning
A pure lead bullet is used in a revolver, a jacketed bullet with a lead core is used in a pistol.	Reasoning
A pure lead bullet will never look white.	Reasoning
Its colour will always be greyish black.	Reasoning
If pure lead bullets caused the wounds on Haren Pandyas body, they would have been greyish black even when removed at the time of post mortem.	Reasoning
The bullet sent to CFSL and later produced in court were pure lead bullets which could never have looked white.	Reasoning
Therefore, these bullets could not be the ones recovered from the body at post mortem which were white metal bullets, seen by the four doctors conducting the post mortem.	Reasoning
As a matter of fact, the doctor has clearly opined that white bullets were seized and they were sent for ballistic examination and they have been produced from the CFSL.	Reasoning
In our opinion, it was necessary to put in the crossexamination of PW8 the fact that the bullets which were produced in court were not the same which were recovered at the time of post mortem, which has not been done.	Reasoning
Thus his testimony cannot be discredited on this aspect.	Reasoning
PW75, Forensic Expert, Mr. Ashok Raj Arora, Senior Scientific Officer (Ballistics), Asstt.	None
Chemical Examiner to Government of India has stated that 5 shots were fired from a single standard weapon.	None
He compared the seals.	None
The bullets were fired from a .32 revolver.	None
IN RE FORENSIC EVIDENCE As per the doctor, the bullets were made of white metal.	None
The Autopsy doctor (PW8) Mr. Pratik Ravjibhai Patel however, on seeing the bullets Exhs.	None
18/1, 18/2, 18/3, 18/4 and 18/5, has clearly stated that the color of the bullets is grayish and they were slightly deformed.	None
It is not the crossexamination made that these bullets were not found in the body.	None
It was the duty of the crossexaminer to obtain explanation that whether these bullets which were shown and stated by the doctor to have been recovered from the body of Haren Pandya were not the same.	None
When the doctor has seen the bullets and had identified them that they were recovered from the body, no dent is caused by the statement of the doctor that they were made of white metal.	None
It is the perception of the doctor of which metal they were made.	None
Proper identification of the bullets recovered was established in the court by the witness.	None
The prosecution has successfully established the chain of seizure of five very bullets up to production in court which were recovered from the body of the deceased.	None
PW8 has stated that during autopsy five bullets were recovered from the body of Haren Pandya which was handed over to the (PW170) police constable in sealed condition.	None
(PW170) Bipin Bhai, a constable on duty has stated that he received five bullets in the sealed condition and has handed over the sealed five bullets to police inspector Y.A. Sheikh (PW101) in the presence of panchwitness, Falgun Pandya (PW2).	None
Further, evidence of (PW101), Y.A. Sheikh indicates that he has handed over five bullets recovered from the body of Haren Pandya to PW107 who during the course of the investigation had handed over the same to PW120 on 28.3.2003.	None
The evidence further discloses that PW120, Dy. S.P., Mr. Gupta forwarded the said five bullets vide letter dated 4.4.2001 in the sealed condition to V.S.G.H. EBAB Forensic Medicine through Director, CFSL, New Delhi vide letter dated 25.4.2004.	None
Exh.442 is the document of receipts by which five bullets were sent to Central Forensic Science Laboratory, New Delhi with seal intact and specimen.	None
Exh.458 points out that blood found on the five bullets, kurta pyjama and lifted from the car was of B?	None
Group.	None
Thus, it is apparent that the seals have been found intact and there is positive evidence of the custody of the appellants.	None
Thus, it is farfetched and intentional for the defence to contend that bullets have been changed.	None
There is no room to entertain the said submission.	None
PW75, Mr. Ashok Raj Arora, Senior Scientific Officer, (Ballistics), Assistant Chemical Examiner, Government of India in his deposition has clearly stated that all the bullets are received in sealed condition from CFSL, New Delhi.	None
He has also identified articles 18/1 to 18/5 in the seal applied on the backside of Khakhi cover which is stated to be muddamal article 18/5 which is the seal he had applied.	None
He has stated that he has examined articles 18/1 to 18/5 of which he has given the details.	None
He has further stated in his examination that the bullets were of blackish grey colour but the one with a jacket would have copper or aluminum colour.	None
If the bullet is of white metal then the metal would be made of steel or aluminium but he has not seen nor examined the white coloured jacket bullet.	None
Thus, it is clear that what has been produced in the court are the same articles which were examined by the forensic expert (PW75).	None
On behalf of the accused, it was submitted that the chemical test on the clothes has not been done to ascertain the nature of bullets used in the offence.	Reasoning
The test, as well as breach face mark, have to be performed which is prescribed in the CBI Forensic Manual.	Reasoning
The test is must to eliminate by proper evidence before concluding that un jacketed bullets had been used and therefore the revolver was used.	Reasoning
Metal will be present in both unjacketed and jacketed bullets.	Reasoning
No copper test was done in the case, therefore, it is not known whether the actual weapon was a pistol or revolver.	Reasoning
In our opinion, even in the absence of the aforesaid test, the evidence conclusively establishes that the revolver was used in the offence for firing the bullets in question and that has been proved to be a weapon of the offence and recovered too.	Reasoning
The evidence discloses that during the course of police custody Mohmed Asgar Ali (A1) on 26.1.2003 gave a disclosure statement and indicated the place for recovery of the weapon in the presence of Additional S.P. Chikara and Police Inspector PW3 Shri Rathi.	None
Mohmed Asgar Ali (A1) has mentioned in his disclosure statement (Exh.656) information pursuant to which two weapons i.e. one revolver and one pistol and the cartridges were recovered vide inquest memo Exh.196 along with the clothes Exh.1 which A1 worn at the time of occurrence.	None
PW13, Shrinathsingh, panch witness and Mr. Chikara have proved the aforesaid aspects.	None
The weapons were recovered hidden in the tank of Battiwla Stove at Kamar Flat in Shahpur.	None
The aforesaid articles seized vide memo Exhibit 196 were sealed on the same day i.e. on 27.4.2003 and sent to CFSL, New Delhi along with the clothes of Mohmed Asgar Ali (A1).	None
PW75 received a list of the material objects along with forwarding letter (Exh.443) along with .32 bore revolver bearing serial No.B 40350, six .32 bore Scot Webley cartridges and 7.65 mm pistol bearing serial No.EE 0330, seven 7.65 mm pistol cartridges and one 7.65 mm empty magazine bearing serial no.3497 and clothes of the accused A1.	None
On the basis of the examination carried out by forensic examiner, it was opined that five .32 bore fired bullets received by him on 25.4.2003 had been fired from .32 bore revolver bearing serial No.B 40350 and not from any other firearm, even of the same make, caliber or bore on the ground that every firearm has its own individual characteristics marks.	None
Mr. Gupta (PW120) in his deposition has stated that Mohd.	None
Yousuf Maniyari, accused, who has been detained has made a statement that five empty cartridge cases were given to him by absconding accused Mufti Sufiyan on 3.4.2003.	None
They were recovered from his shop tied in a cloth vide seizure memo (Exh.628 dated 10.7.2003).	None
Information memo (Exh.639) was drawn pursuant to disclosure dated 10.07.2003.	None
Mr.Arora (PW75) received the parcel on 16.7.2003.	None
In all, they recovered four .32 bore S WL fired cartridge cases.	None
As they were required to be compared with .32 bore revolver bearing Serial No.B 40350, the same had been received by him once again and he opined that these four .32 bore fired cartridges contained in parcel No.22 had been fired from .32 bore revolver bearing Serial No.B 40350.	None
He also found that though the revolver was in working condition the firing pin of the revolver was found tampered.	None
The prosecution urged that it is not the requirement of law that pellets recovered from the body be sent to the ballistic expert to determine whether they were fired from the given article or not.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the contrary, the recovery of pellets from the body clearly establishes the prosecution?s case that the deceased died of the gunshot injuries.	Arguments of Petitioner
PW8, surgeon is unaware of the difference between white metal bullets jacketed bullet, as white metal is a cupronickel or zinc but, lead bullet is grayish black and thus, the cupro zinc or cupronickel jacketed bullet in relation to lead bullet is said to be white coloured metal whereas, grayish would indicate lead bullet.	Arguments of Petitioner
91.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was argued that PW75 did not find the firing pin damaged when the weapon was first examined by him on 05.05.2003.	Arguments of Petitioner
The witness was not able to explain the reason for examining the weapon once again and for the examination of the damaged firing pin.	None
The defence submitted that in the circumstances the identification would not be possible.	None
The prosecution has submitted that the breach face mark, if available and sufficient, can lead to provide identification in case of tampering of a pin.	None
Reliance has been placed on behalf of the accused on the deposition of Dr. Jitendra Kumar Sinha (DW8).	None
He has admitted not to have seen any of the exhibits pertaining to the case in question namely the firearms, crime cartridges, test cartridges, empty cartridges, etc. nor had any occasion to examine those exhibits under a stereomicroscope.	Arguments of Respondent
(DW8) in the crossexamination was questioned whether striation marks of the land and grooves imprinted on the surface of the bullet would be individual characteristics marks.	Arguments of Respondent
It was stated that there may be striation due to extraneous marks which cannot be called individual characteristic explaining the same.	Arguments of Respondent
It was the wrong noncommittal reply.	Arguments of Respondent
The trial court in the circumstances has referred to individual characteristics on the point and relied on ?	Arguments of Respondent
An Introduction of Tool Marks?, Firearms under the heading of ?Individual Characteristics?	Arguments of Respondent
by John E. Davis, the Author observed as to the striation marks thus The Individual Characteristics on a fired bullet are those features which distinguish it from bullets fired through all other bores.	Arguments of Respondent
Practically speaking, the term applies to those minute striae along the land and groove impressions which are produced by, and are characteristic of irregularities within a given bore.	Arguments of Respondent
Bullets are finally identified with a specific weapon on the basis of these striae.	Arguments of Respondent
It is apparent that every fired bullet has individual characteristics in the form of minute striae along with the land and groove impression.	Reasoning
The bullets are finally identified with the specific weapons on the basis of these striae.	Reasoning
DW8 has also stated that in 95 of the cases, filing in marks alone permit identification of the firearm, but in the event of any tampering of firing pin, the expert would examine breach face mark which shall have to be compared with test fired cartridges to confirm the opinion that the cartridges are fired from the said firearm.	Reasoning
The act of disclosure of the weapon and its discovery at the instance of A1 and the bullets found in the body of Haren Pandya was sent to CFSL, New Delhi wherein it has been opined that they have been fired with the standard weapon (revolver of .32 bore), which had been recovered.	None
94.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted by the prosecution that the same very cartridges were seized and sent to Forensic Science Laboratory as stated by Dr. Kuldeep Jayantilal Joshi (PW20), CMO, V.S. Hospital, Dr. Anil Sharma (PW19) and Bipinchandra Mehta (PW70), panch witness PW10, Y.A. Shaik (PW101), etc.	Arguments of Petitioner
These were received by PW 75, Mr. Arora after the Department of Biology tested it.	None
The weapon was seized on 27.04.2003 and sent on 2nd 3rd May 2003 to CFSL.	None
It is a fact that initially when the expert first examined the revolver he did not realise the fact that the firing pin of the said weapon tampered.	None
When once again after the cartridge cases discovered at the instance of the accused (A17) were sent for the laboratory testing, he realised that the firing pin had tampered.	None
Be that as it may, the taletelling marks of striae makes the position clear.	None
A correspondence between major striae, general gross counter and a reasonable number of finer striae will prove identity.	None
No two bullets encounter precisely the same conditions in passing through a bore, nor do the corresponding striae always appear at the same lengthwise position on identical specimen.	None
Dr. Arora emphasised that while giving his testimony before the court that degree of similarities which are found was never perfect identity considering the striking area covered by the tampered fire pin and comparison of the same with the untampered firing pin.	None
Thus, the evidence of DW8 also makes it clear that breach face alone is sufficient to confirm the opinion if they are found to be repetitive and also of repetitive character of the striations which are due to an individual firearm can be related to a particular firearm.	Reasoning
In this case, while ignoring the difference caused by tampering of the firing pin found the second time, the basic striation marks remain the same which is individual for every revolver and is not to be found in any other such weapon.	Reasoning
Thus, the evidence is conclusive to prove that the revolver in question was used in firing the bullets recovered from the body of the deceased Haren Pandya.	Reasoning
The medical evidence, thus, supports the version of PW55.	Arguments of Petitioner
PW8 who prepared the post mortem report has been discarded while relying upon the version of defence witness DW6 who stated injuries 5 and 6 as communicating injuries.	None
This Court in Tanviben Pankajkumar Divetia v. State of Gujarat, (1997) 7 SCC 156 has observed that the autopsy doctor?s report cannot be discarded lightly as he had seen the injuries.	None
In Tanviben Pankajkumar Divetia (supra) at para 35, this Court held as ?	None
35We may also indicate here that the doctor who had held the post mortem examination had occasion to see the injuries of the deceased quite closely.	None
In the absence of any convincing evidence that the doctor holding post mortem examination had deliberately given a wrong report, his evidence is not liable to be discarded and in our view, in the facts of the case, the opinion of the doctor holding post mortem examination is to be preferred to the expert opinion of Dr. Shariff.?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
In Eshwaraiah Anr.	None
v. State of Karnataka, (1994)	Arguments of Respondent
2 SCC 677 , this Court has observed in this regard thus ?	None
9In our view, the High Court has lightly held that the said doctor had no occasion to see the dead body and the injuries on the person of the deceased and only from the report of the post mortem the said doctor gave an expert opinion.	None
On the contrary, two doctors who had held the post mortem on the deceased had occasion to look and examine the injuries on the person of the deceased and they had given a clear opinion that the death was due to asphyxia	None
and it was a case of homicidal death?	None
(emphasis supplied) INTERPOLATION OF SPOT MAP	None
The site map was sought to be discredited on the basis that PW 120, I.O. of CBI gave a contradictory reply.	None
He said that the original spot map was drawn by pencil and later on drawn in ink.	None
It was clearly stated that at the time of redrawing the same, later on, the name of accused Asghar Ali was mentioned as it was known by that time.	None
No dent is caused by the said mentioning of the name of the accused and from the explanation given by PW120, it is apparent that the name has been added later on.	None
The High Court has also doubted by prosecution case with respect to interpolation and site map with respect to the name of A1.	None
Dr. Gupta, I.O. of CBI, PW120 has explained the said aspect in the following manner Question	None
You are being shown Exh387.	None
At the bottom, the word Asagarali is written, and has it been checked in Note3 thereafter?	None
Answer Looking at it through the magnifying glass, I say that I am unable to say.	None
The witness states clarifying that the site plan of Exh 387 was drawn at the time on 29/3/03 with pencil, and at each place, the noting was made with pencil.	None
At the time of attaching it to the charge sheet, it was very dim and therefore, it was made clearer with the help of sketch pen and the drawing and the writing made with the pencil has been stroked out and the note written at the bottom was written at the time of filing the charge sheet.	None
Therefore, there are some pencil marks on this paper.	None
At the place of A, D and LawGarden, NCC Ground and HP Car, etc. is written, it seems.	None
The writing done on the entire sketch is made by my colleague PI Mr. Vijayvirsinh in his handwriting.	None
The noting point 3 and 4 written after erasing would have been falsely written by Vijayvirsinh.	None
So it was removed erased, but I do not agree with the view that Asagarali has written it.	None
Question After writing the name of Asagarali in Note3 and	None
Exh 387, you have erased it?	None
Answer I do not agree with that view.	None
It is not true and I do not agree with this view that on 29/3/03, we knew that we would book Asagarali in this case.	None
He is to be implicated, and his name was written and later when it was realized that it was the document dated 29/3/03, his name was spoken out.?	None
The High Court ought to have taken note of the aforesaid statement in what circumstances name came to be added later on.	None
It was clearly a mistake as admitted by the witness.	None
NONEXAMINATION OF JAGRUTIBEN, W O. HAREN PANDYA	None
It was submitted on behalf of the accused that Ms. Jagrutiben, wife of Haren Pandya should have been examined so as to prove that the offence took place at about 7.30 a.m. as she has stated in the statement under Section 161 Cr.	Arguments of Respondent
P.C. tha	Reasoning
deceased left house at around 7.00 a.m.	Reasoning
Some of the friends of deceased and P.A. etc. later on reached the spot they have not been examined.	Reasoning
In our opinion, no dent is caused as Jagrutiben and other persons were not the eye witnesses.	Reasoning
In case of any doubt, they could have been examined as defence witnesses.	Reasoning
Jagrutiben, even if examined, would have proved the fact that deceased left for Law Garden at around 7 a.m. and he would have reached there around 7.10 a.m.	Reasoning
No benefit can be drawn from the aforesaid aspect.	Reasoning
No adverse inference can be drawn against prosecution due to nonexamination of Jagrutiben.	Reasoning
As estimation of time may differ and as per Jagrutiben, deceased left for Law Garden only where he used to go for a morning walk.	Reasoning
IN RE CALL RECORD 103.	None
Learned Addl.	Arguments of Petitioner
Solicitor General on behalf of the prosecution has submitted that all call records of the accused persons during the entire period of conspiracy and the tower location of the phones of the accused persons near the Law Garden on the day of the murder of Haren Pandya are the strong circumstantial evidence against the accused persons.	Arguments of Petitioner
The accused persons were in possession of mobile phones and were in constant touch with each other before, during and after the commission of the crime through their mobile or landline phones, as depicted in the call details records, in order to execute the conspiracy.	None
As mobile phone No.9825491421 was used by A1, his location at 7.33 a.m. on 26.3.2003 in the area near Law Garden and A14 providing three new BSNL SIMs.	None
to A7, A8 and A9 on 25.3.2003 and their location on 25.3.2003 and 26.3.2003 near Law Garden were strong corroborative evidence of the presence of some of the accused in the Law Garden area.	None
The printouts of email sent by A 1, A2 and A18 revealed that they were operating in furtherance of a common object as also the presence of some of them in Udaipur and Ahmedabad, even as the text of email messages did not reveal any specific plan of committing any particular crime.	None
It is pertinent to mention that the trial court has extensively dealt with the mobile phone, sim card details and the evidence adduced to prove the usage of the said phone handsets and sim cards by the accused persons.	None
IN RE MOTORBIKE USED BY A1 AND A6 The motorbike used by A1 and A6 at the time of the commission of the offence was duly recovered.	None
The entire gamut of facts relating to the motorbike is as under A10 purchased motorcycle No.GJISS5934 from PW54 and gave it to A1 in the first week of February 2003 for his movements in Ahmedabad.	None
After the commission of a crime, the motorcycle was handed over by A10 to PW45 while fleeing from Ahmedabad on 4.4.2003 and thereafter PW45 parked the same in the parking of Kalupur Railway Station from where the same was recovered by CBI in presence of PW24 on the night intervening 24/25.4.2003.	None
In December 2002, on the directions of A13, PW57 (hostile witness but statement under section 164 Cr.PC arranged 3 stolen motor Hero Honda motorcycles and handed over the same to A4.	None
Thereafter, A4 retained one with him and handed over one each to A14 and A5.	None
Later on, these motorcycles were used in the commission of a crime on 11.3.2003, 25.3.2003 and 26.3.2003.	None
One of the stolen motorcycles was handed over by A10 to PW45 on 3/4.4.2003 while fleeing from Ahmedabad.	None
PW45 parked the same in Apsara Aradhna Theatre and later on brought by PS Kagdapeeth from where it was seized by CBI on the pointing of PW45 on 25.4.2003.	None
A fake number plate bearing No.GJICH5189 was got prepared by A7 and A8 from PW52.	None
This number plate was put on the second Hero Honda motorcycle after the commission of a crime.	None
The said motorcycle was abandoned by A10 and A11 while fleeing from Ahmedabad at Tarapur Highway.	None
The fake number plate was removed from the motorcycle and thrown into roadside bushes which were recovered under section 27 Evidence Act at the pointing out of A10 in presence of PW86 on 12.6.2003.	None
the said motorcycle was taken into possession by PS Koth and thereafter seized by CBI on 12.6.2003 from PS Koth.	None
Presence of A1 at Ahmedabad is proved by the use of phone number and by PW95.	None
With respect to the disappearance of the mobile phone of accused A1, no such question was put to I.O., PW120 that mobile of A1 had disappeared from Muddamal.	None
Neither any mobile phone nor any sim card was seized from A1 on his arrest by one DIG Shri Behra.	None
It is, in fact, Yusufbhai, PW95 who is an independent witness who stayed in the same Royal Apartments as A1 has proved that A1 was using mobile No.9825491421 during the relevant time.	None
PLACE OF EYE WITNESS NOT DEPICTED IN SPOT MAP With respect to not showing the presence at a particular spot of an eyewitness in the spot map, reliance has been placed by the prosecution on a decision of this Court in Tori Singh Anr.	None
v. State of U.P., AIR 1962 SC 399 .	None
With respect to the spot map, it has been observed that it would be based on hearsay of witness.	None
Spot map would be admissible so far as it indicates all that the Inspector saw himself at the spot.	None
Any mark put on the spot map on the basis of statements made by the witness to the Inspector would be inadmissible in view of the clear provisions of section 162 Cr.	None
P.C.	Reasoning
This Court has observed thus ?	None
7.	Reasoning
We are of opinion that neither of these arguments has any force.	None
Let us first take the contention that it was most unlikely that the deceased would be hit on that part of the body where the injury was actually received by him if he was at the spot marked in Ex. Ka9.	None
The validity of this argument depends mainly on the spot which has been marked on the sketchmap Ex. Ka9	None
as the place where the deceased received his injuries.	None
In the first place, the map itself is not to scale but is merely a rough sketch and therefore one cannot postulate that the spot marked on the map is in exact relation to the platform.	None
In the second place, the mark on the sketchmap was put by the Sub Inspector who was obviously not an eyewitness to the incident.	None
He could only have put it there after taking the statements of the eyewitnesses.	None
The marking of the spot on the sketchmap is really bringing on record the conclusion of the SubInspector on the basis of the statements made by the witnesses to him.	None
This in our opinion would not be admissible in view of the provisions of Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for it is in effect nothing more than the statement of the SubInspector that the eyewitnesses told him that the deceased was at such and such place at the time when he was hit.	None
The sketchmap would be admissible so far as it indicates all that the Sub Inspector saw himself at the spot but any mark put on the sketch map based on the statements made by the witnesses to the Sub Inspector would be inadmissible in view of the clear provisions of Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it will be no more than a statement made to the police during investigation.	None
We may in this connection refer to Bhagirathi Chowdhury v. KingEmperor, AIR 1926	None
Cal.	None
550 , where it was observed that placing of maps before the jury containing statements of witnesses or of information received by the investigating officer preparing the map from other persons was improper and that the investigating officer who made a map in a criminal case ought not to put anything more than what he had seen himself.	None
The same view was expressed by the Calcutta High Court again in Ibra Akanda v. Emperor, AIR 1944 Cal. 339 , where it was held that any information derived from witnesses during police investigation, and recorded in the index to a map, must be proved by the witnesses concerned and not by the investigating officer, and that if such information is sought to be proved by the evidence of the investigating officer, it would manifestly offend against Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.?	None
In Pratap Singh Anr.	None
v. State of M.P., 2005 (13) SCC 624 , it was held that even if the witnesses are not reflected in the site plan, that does not bar the prosecution to produce such witnesses during the trial.	None
Since PW55 has not been confronted with the site plan and no question had been asked to the witness, thus his ocular evidence cannot be discredited on the basis of the aforesaid omission.	None
O. NOT ON SPOT The High Court has also employed the reason that Police Inspector PW101 was supposed to be investigating at 2 p.m. on 26.3.2003 at the scene of the offence.	None
He was shown present at post mortem at 2.15 p.m. PW101 in this regard he has explained that he handed over the papers to Head Constable.	None
Post Mortem might have been made at 2.15 p.m.	None
but he was not present in the post mortem room at that time.	None
The statement of the witnesses ought to have prevailed as to his presence on the spot.	None
RECOVERY OF REVOLVER AND PISTOL FROM A1	None
In spite of the tampering of the firing pin, the material striations are telling the tale and overall evidence inspires confidence and no dent is caused in the prosecution case.	Reasoning
In our considered opinion the bullets and cartridges seized from A1 match with the revolver and bullet recovered from Haren Pandyas body.	Reasoning
We reject the submission raised by A1.	Reasoning
The recovery was from the rented flat of A1 at Ahmedabad.	Reasoning
No one had access to the place and knowledge.	Reasoning
Thus, the recovery at the instance of A1 is not doubtful.	Reasoning
Statement of PW76, Akhtar is not at all with respect to the disclosure and discovery attributed to A1 on the intervening night of 26.4.2003 and 27.4.2003 of a revolver, pistol, and cartridges.	Reasoning
PW76 has deposed as to the motorcycle.	Reasoning
In our opinion, it was not for the police to explain as to who had put two locks on the flat as submitted by the accused.	Reasoning
That no adverse inference can be drawn for failure to explain putting of 2 locks.	Reasoning
In no case, locks can be attributed to CBI.	None
The High Court has observed that in view of the concession granted by the counsel for the appellants, voluminous records and number of controversies about each piece of evidence, it was not necessary to be dealt with and each and every argument of learned counsel for both the sides.	None
It could not be said to be the proper approach of the High Court.	Reasoning
The High Court ought to have examined the entire background as to what facts and circumstances prevailed and whether the chain was complete to make out the case of conspiracy.	Reasoning
It was absolutely necessary so as to find out the conspiracy.	Reasoning
The acquittal recorded by the High Court was wholly uncalled for and is based on basically a wrong approach.	Reasoning
It was incumbent upon the High Court to come a close quarter of reasoning employed by the trial Court and assessment of the evidence of the witnesses done by the trial court with great care, in an elaborate manner.	Reasoning
The High Court has failed to consider the reasons and has jumped to the conclusion.	Reasoning
IN RE SECTION 32 OF POTA We now take the question for consideration whether confessional statements have been recorded after due compliance of provisions of section 32 of POTA.	None
The confession of the accused persons recorded under section 32 of POTA proves the involvement of each and every accused person in the criminal conspiracy.	Issue
The question has been raised that whether the safeguards provided under section 32 have not been observed.	Issue
Section 32 of the POTA contains a nonobstante clause like notwithstanding anything in the Criminal Procedure Code or in the Indian Evidence Act and makes admissible certain confessions made to the Police Officers.	None
However, the same is subject to the provisions of section 32 which is extracted hereunder ?	None
32.	None
Certain confessions made to police officers to be taken into consideration.	None
(1) Notwithstanding anything in the Code or in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), but subject to the provisions of this section, a confession made by a person before a police officer not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police and recorded by such police officer either in writing or on any mechanical or electronic device like cassettes, tapes or sound tracks from out of which sound or images can be reproduced, shall be admissible in the trial of such person for an offence under this Act or the rules made thereunder.	None
(2) A police officer shall, before recording any confession made by a person under subsection (1), explain to such person in writing that he is not bound to make a confession and that if he does so, it may be used against him Provided that where such person prefers to remain silent, the police officer shall not compel or induce him to make any confession.	None
(3) The confession shall be recorded in an atmosphere free from threat or inducement and shall be in the same language in which the person makes it.	None
(4) The person from whom a confession has been recorded under subsection (1), shall be produced before the Court of a Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate along with the original statement of confession, written or recorded on the mechanical or electronic device within fortyeight hours.	Reasoning
(5) The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Chief Judicial Magistrate, shall, record the statement, if any, made by the person so produced and get his signature or thumb impression and if there is any complaint of torture, such person shall be directed to be produced for medical examination before a Medical Officer not lower in rank than an Assistant Civil Surgeon and thereafter, he shall be sent to judicial custody.?	None
Following safeguards are provided in the provisions contained in section 32 of the Act (i).	None
Confession to be made by the person before a Police Officer not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police.	None
(ii).	None

It is pertinent to mention here that a similar process has been followed while recording the confessional statement of accused persons by PW21 under section 32 of POTA.	None
124.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that on the strength of a decision of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu etc., (2005) 11 SCC 600 (hereinafter referred to as the Parliament attack case), POTA has absorbed into it the guidelines spelled out in Kartar Singhs case (1994) 3 SCC 569 , and there is a conscious improvement over the TADA Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, TADA is no guide to understanding the same with respect to confirmation proceedings before the Magistrate.	Arguments of Petitioner
Following is the relevant portion ?156.	None
As already noticed, POTA has absorbed into it the guidelines spelt out in Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab, (1994) 3 SCC 569 and D.K. Basu v. State of W.B., (1997)	None
1 SCC 416 , in order to impart an element of fairness and reasonableness into the stringent provisions of POTA in tune with the philosophy of Article 21 and allied constitutional provisions.	None
These salutary safeguards are contained in Sections 32 and 52 of POTA.	None
The peremptory prescriptions embodied in Section 32 of POTA are (a)	None
The police officer shall warn the accused that he is not bound to make the confession and if he does so, it may be used against him vide subsection (2).	None
(b)	None
The confession shall be recorded in an atmosphere free from threat or inducement and shall be in the same language in which the person makes it vide subsection (3).	None
(c) The person from whom a confession has been recorded under subsection (1) shall be produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or Chief Judicial Magistrate along with the original statement of confession, within fortyeight hours vide sub section (4).	None
(d)	Arguments of Petitioner
The CMM CJM shall record the statement if any, made by the person so produced and get his signature and if there is any complaint of torture, such person shall be directed to be produced for medical examination.	None
After recording the statement and after medical examination, if necessary, he shall be sent to judicial custody vide sub section (5).	None
The mandate of subsections (2) and (3) is not something new.	None
Almost similar prescriptions were there under TADA also.	None
In fact, the fulfilment of such mandate is inherent in the process of recording a confession by a statutory authority.	None
What is necessarily implicit is, perhaps, made explicit.	None
But the notable safeguards which were lacking in TADA are to be found in sub sections (4) and (5).	Reasoning
157.	None
The lofty purpose behind the mandate that the maker of the confession shall be sent to judicial custody by the CJM before whom he is produced is to provide an atmosphere in which he would feel free to make a complaint against the police if he so wishes.	None
The feeling that he will be free from the shackles of police custody after production in court will minimise, if not remove, the fear psychosis by which he may be gripped.	None
The various safeguards enshrined in Section 32 are meant to be strictly observed as they relate to personal liberty of an individual.	None
However, we add a caveat here.	None
The strict enforcement of the provision as to judicial remand and the invalidation of the confession merely on the ground of its noncompliance may present some practical difficulties at times.	None
Situations may arise that even after the confession is made by a person in custody, police custody may still be required for the purpose of further investigation.	None
Sending a person to judicial custody at that stage may retard the investigation.	None
Sometimes, the further steps to be taken by the investigator with the help of the accused may brook no delay.	None
An attempt shall however be made to harmonise this provision in Section 32(5) with the powers of investigation available to the police.	None
At the same time, it needs to be emphasised that the obligation to send the confession maker to judicial custody cannot be lightly disregarded.	None
Police custody cannot be given on the mere asking by the police.	None
It shall be remembered that sending a person who has made the confession to judicial custody after he is produced before the CJM is the normal rule and this procedural safeguard should be given its due primacy.	None
The CJM should be satisfied that it is absolutely necessary that the confession maker shall be restored to police custody for any special reason.	None
Such a course of sending him back to police custody could only be done in exceptional cases after due application of mind.	None
Most often, sending such person to judicial custody in compliance with Section 32(5) soon after the proceedings are recorded by the CJM subject to the consideration of the application by the police after a few days may not make material difference to the further investigation.	None
The CJM has a duty to consider whether the application is only a ruse to get back the person concerned to police custody in case he disputes the confession or it is an application made bona fide in view of the need and urgency involved.	None
We are therefore of the view that the noncompliance with the judicial custody requirement does not per se vitiate the confession, though its noncompliance should be one of the important factors that must be borne in mind in testing the confession.?	None
This Court has observed that safeguards have been provided in various provisions made in section 32.	Reasoning
Exclusive provisions have been made in section 32.	Reasoning
The notable safeguards which were lacking in TADA are to be found in subsections (4) and (5).	Reasoning
While interpreting the provisions of section 32(5), this Court has observed that ordinarily the person should be sent to judicial custody.	Reasoning
In exceptional cases, police custody can be granted and not otherwise.	Reasoning
Noncompliance with usual custody requirement does not per se vitiate the confession.	Reasoning
In the instant case, the accused persons have been sent to judicial custody and the provisions of section 32 have been complied with in pith and substance.	Reasoning
It was also submitted on behalf of accused persons the strength of the Parliament attack case that the Magistrate should have read out the confession or at least gist of the same for compliance of provisions of section 32(5).	Reasoning
The magistrate should also assure the accused beforehand that he can be sent to judicial custody and thereafter it is not enough that he ends up sending him to judicial custody.	None
The statement of the accused is read over by the S.P. and if the same is admitted to be correct, thereafter he had put his signatures.	Reasoning
Section 32(4) requires that the person whose confession has been recorded to be produced before the Magistrate along with an ordinary statement of confession within 48 hours.	Reasoning
The Magistrate shall record the statement, if any, made by the person so produced and get his signatures or thumb impression.	Reasoning
If there is any complaint of torture then medical examination has to be ordered and thereafter he shall be sent to judicial custody.	Reasoning
When we read order sheets, it is apparent that the Magistrate has recorded the statement made by the accused and has obtained the signatures.	Reasoning
The Magistrate has clearly enquired whether he was illtreated or tortured by the CBI while in custody, for recording a confessional statement to which he replied in the negative.	Reasoning
The accused was asked what he wanted to say to which he responded that he made a voluntary confessional statement.	Reasoning
Then he was remanded to judicial custody.	Reasoning
In view of the fact that the officer of the rank of S.P. has duly recorded that he has read over the statement and the accused has admitted it to be correct, as in due compliance with the provisions of section 32, so it was not necessary for the Magistrate to read over the same again to the accused, in view of clear language employed in section 32(4) and (5) the duties enjoined upon the Magistrate have been duly observed.	Reasoning
Learned counsel on behalf of the accused submitted that the Magistrate did not care to open the sealed envelope containing confessions and did not read it out to the accused.	None
In State of Maharashtra v. Bharat Chaganlal Raghani Ors., (2001) 9 SCC 1 , this Court has observed that there is no requirement of the opening of the sealed envelope by the Magistrate containing the confession and to read it out to the accused.	None
Following observations have been made by this Court Subrule (5) of Rule 15 of the TADA Rules provides that the confession recorded under Section 15 of the TADA Act shall be sent forthwith to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Chief Judicial Magistrate having jurisdiction over the area in which such confession has been recorded and such Magistrate shall forward the record of confession so received to the Designated Court which may take cognizance of the offence.	None
Rule 15 does not oblige such Magistrate either to open the envelope containing the confessional statement recorded by the police officer or to satisfy himself regarding the voluntary nature of the confession.	None
The Magistrate, at the most, can record the statement of the accused if made regarding alleged harassment, torture or the like.	None
If the Magistrate, referred to in subrule (5) of Rule 15 has to ascertain the voluntary nature of the confessional statement, the purpose of Section 15 authorising a police officer to record the confessional statement shall stand frustrated.	None
It was, therefore, not correct on the part of the Designated Judge to hold, ?	None
it was obligatory on the part of the Magistrate to question the accused as to whether they had made the said statements voluntarily or otherwise and that ought to have been formed as a part of the record of the confessional statements which were sent to her? .	None
The Designated Judge has also erred in holding that the Magistrate had not discharged the duties which were cast on her properly.	None
The observations ?	None
Had she recorded a memorandum below the confessional statements that she had questioned the accused about the averments in the said statements and she considered the said confessional statements to be voluntary and correct, then in that event, the confessional statements would have inspired the confidence of the court to believe that they are free from any of the influences.	None
The Magistrate is not expected to take the position of a superior postman in the sense, receive the confessional statements and forward the same to the TADA Court by putting them in another envelope.	None
The moment she receives the confessional statements, it should occur to her as to why they are sent to her?	None
What is she required to do with them?	None
Had the Magistrate been meticulous, it would have occurred to her that she is required to question the accused as to whether they have really confessed in the manner recorded in the statement and in that event, in normal course, she would not have forgotten to make a memorandum below the confessional statements.	None
Her writing to this effect below the confessional statements would have been of great assistance to the cause of justice?	None
are, therefore, uncalled for.	None
The application which was filed by the prosecution before Magistrate was not for police remand but for sending him to judicial custody.	Reasoning
Thus, when the accused had been sent to judicial custody, it cannot be said that he was not aware that he was to be sent to judicial custody.	Reasoning
Since there was no complaint of any torture and S.P. had also recorded the fact that there was no complaint of torture or any mark of injury or violence on his body, he was sent to judicial custody.	Reasoning
The decision in Adambhai Sulemanbhai Ajmeri Ors. v. State of Gujarat, (2014) 7 SCC 716 in which confessional statement was made after 11 months and the accused was given only 15 minutes?	Reasoning
time to reflect whether they wanted to make confessional statement and thereafter it was recorded, and it appears that the record of the case also did not reflect that it was read over.	Reasoning
It does not appear that in the said case it was read over by the Superintendent of Police.	Reasoning
Be that as it may.	Reasoning
The requirement has been fulfilled in the instant case as the S.P. has read over and is so recorded, that he has read over and it was admitted to be correct and thereafter the accused has signed it.	Reasoning
The original statements were recorded in the Hindi language which was known to the accused persons in their own words.	None
Relying upon Nathu v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1956 SC 56 , learned counsel on behalf of accused persons submitted that prolong police custody is sufficient to cast doubt out on the veracity of the confession.	Arguments of Respondent
In the instant case, the confessions have been recorded from 4.6.2003 to 22.6.2003.	None
In the instant case the accused were arrested on different dates in May and June and some were taken into custody from one case to another and then taken on police remand, and in the facts and circumstances of the present case there was no such prolonged custody so as to render the confessional statement doubtful in any manner only due to the fact of police custody.	Reasoning
The impact of police custody would depend upon the facts of each case.	Reasoning
What is the impact of police custody on the confessional statement has to be considered also in view of the fact whether the accused were given sufficient time to think over which was given in the instant case.	Reasoning
They had legal assistance also as they had communicated with advocates also after they were arrested and then the S.P. explained in writing to them the consequences of making such a statement.	Reasoning
S.P. ensured that they were not under any fear or greed etc. and that they were not tortured.	Reasoning
Thereafter confessional statement had been made.	Reasoning
Sufficient time for reflection had also been given.	Reasoning
Thus, no benefit can be derived from the aforesaid decision.	Reasoning
Learned counsel appearing on behalf of A1 has pointed out that he remained in police custody from 17.4.2003 to 23.5.2003.	Reasoning
Thereafter he was sent for judicial remand and again taken on police remand on 12.6.2003.	Reasoning
After his confession in another POTA case, A1 was remanded back to police custody from 16.5.2003 to 23.5.2003.	Reasoning
Thus, A1 had lost the confidence to speak out during his 10 minutes production before the Magistrate and was not sure that he may be sent to police remand again.	Reasoning
In our opinion the submission is baseless.	Reasoning
It cannot be said to be prolonged police custody.	Reasoning
When several accused persons are involved in various cases and an accused is found involved in a series of cases, obviously, his police remand has to be taken in a particular case.	Reasoning
That does not mean that he has been sent to police remand in some other cases would adversely affect the confession.	Reasoning
What is envisaged is that with respect to the same crime, he should not normally be subjected to police remand once he makes a statement in the court with respect to his confession as we see under section 32(4) and (5), he has to be sent to judicial custody.	Reasoning
That has been precisely followed.	Reasoning
In the case, it cannot be said that he was subjected to prolonged police custody or he had lost the confidence that he would not be sent to judicial custody.	Reasoning
Learned counsel on behalf of accused further submitted that in view of the decision of this Court in Shivappa v. State of Karnataka, (1995) 2 SCC 76 , searching inquiry should be made by the Magistrate before recording confessional statements.	Reasoning
In the instant case, under section 32 of POTA, since there is a departure and confession is made to a senior police officer has been made admissible, the aforesaid decision based on section 164 Cr.	Reasoning
P.C. is not attracted, even otherwise when we apply the aforesaid test laid down with respect to section 164 Cr.	Reasoning
P.C.	Reasoning
as in Shivappa (supra), in our opinion the S.P. under section 32(1), (2) and (3) and the concerned Magistrate under subsections 4 and 5 of section 32 have performed their duties effectively as per the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decision in which this Court observed ?	None
6.	None
From the plain language of Section 164 CrPC and the rules and guidelines framed by the High Court regarding the recording of confessional statements of an accused under Section 164 CrPC, it is manifest that the said provisions emphasise an inquiry by the Magistrate to ascertain the voluntary nature of the confession.	Reasoning
This inquiry appears to be the most significant and an important part of the duty of the Magistrate recording the confessional statement of an accused under Section 164 CrPC.	Reasoning
The failure of the Magistrate to put such questions from which he could ascertain the voluntary nature of the confession detracts so materially from the evidentiary value of the confession of an accused that it would not be safe to act upon the same.	Reasoning
Full and adequate compliance not merely in form but in essence with the provisions of Section 164 CrPC and the rules framed by the High Court is imperative and its noncompliance goes to the root of the Magistrates jurisdiction to record the confession and renders the confession unworthy of credence.	Reasoning
Before proceeding to record the confessional statement, a searching enquiry must be made from the accused as to the custody from which he was produced and the treatment he had been receiving in such custody in order to ensure that there is no scope for doubt of any sort of extraneous influence proceeding from a source interested in the prosecution still lurking in the mind of an accused.	Reasoning
In case the Magistrate discovers on such enquiry that there is ground for such supposition he should give the accused sufficient time for reflection before he is asked to make his statement and should assure himself that during the time of reflection, he is completely out of police influence.	Reasoning
An accused should particularly be asked the reason why he wants to make a statement which would surely go against his selfinterest in course of the trial, even if he contrives subsequently to retract the confession.	Reasoning
Besides administering the caution, warning specifically provided for in the first part of sub section (2) of Section 164 namely, that the accused is not bound to make a statement and that if he makes one it may be used against him as evidence in relation to his complicity in the offence at the trial, that is to follow, he should also, in plain language, be assured of protection from any sort of apprehended torture or pressure from such extraneous agents as the police or the like in case he declines to make a statement and be given the assurance that even if he declined to make the confession, he shall not be remanded to police custody.?	Reasoning
The decision in Aloke Nath Dutta Ors. v. State of West Bengal (2007) 12 SCC 230 , relied on behalf of the accused is based upon section 164 Cr.P.C. which is quite different in which the confession is recorded by the Magistrate.	Reasoning
Section 32 is a departure from the same.	Reasoning
S.P. is authorised to remand and he has observed all the safeguards.	Reasoning
Thus, the decision for the aforesaid reasons has no application.	Reasoning
On the strength of the Parliament attack case (supra), it was submitted that on the twin test of confession and voluntariness of truth.	Arguments of Respondent
The confession must be corroborated in material particulars.	Arguments of Respondent
It is inextricably linked with the truth of confession.	Arguments of Respondent
This Court observed Then we have the case of Shankaria v. State of Rajasthan, (1978) 3 SCC 435 , decided by a threeJudge Bench.	None
Sarkaria, J., noted the twin tests to be applied to evaluate a confession (1) whether the confession was perfectly voluntary, and (2) if so, whether it is true and trustworthy.	None
The learned Judge pointed out that if the first test is not satisfied the question of applying the second test does not arise.	None
Then the Court indicated one broad method by which a confession can be evaluated.	None
It was said (SCC p. 443, para 23) ?	None
The Court should carefully examine the confession and compare it with the rest of the evidence, in the light of the surrounding circumstances and probabilities of the case.	None
If on such examination and comparison, the confession appears to be a probable catalogue of events and naturally fits in with the rest of the evidence and the surrounding circumstances, it may be taken to have satisfied the second test.?	None
37.	None
In Parmananda Pegu v. State of Assam, (2004) 7 SCC 779 , this Court while adverting to the expression ?corroboration of material particulars?	None
used in Pyare Lal Bhargava v. State of Rajasthan, 1963 Supp.	None
(1) SCR 689, clarified the position thus (SCC p. 790, para 20) ?	None
By the use of the expression corroboration of material particulars?, the Court has not laid down any proposition contrary to what has been clarified in Subramania Goundan v. State of Madras, 1958 SCR 428 , as regards the extent of corroboration required.	None
The above expression does not imply that there should be meticulous examination of the entire material particulars.	None
It is enough that there is broad corroboration in conformity with the general trend of the confession, as pointed out in Subramania Goundan case.?	None
The analysis of the legal position in paras 18 and 19 is also worth noting (SCC p. 788) ?	None
18.	None
Having thus reached a finding as to the voluntary nature of a confession, the truth of the confession should then be tested by the court.	None
The fact that the confession has been made voluntarily, free from threat and inducement, can be regarded as presumptive evidence of its truth.	None
Still, there may be circumstances to indicate that the confession cannot be true wholly or partly in which case it loses much of its evidentiary value.	None
19.	None
In order to be assured of the truth of confession, this Court, in a series of decisions, has evolved a rule of prudence that the court should look to corroboration from other evidence.	None
However, there need not be corroboration in respect of each and every material particular.	None
Broadly, there should be corroboration so that the confession taken as a whole fits into the facts proved by other evidence.	None
In substance, the court should have assurance from all angles that the retracted confession was, in fact, voluntary and it must have been true.??	None
There is no dispute with the aforesaid proposition.	Reasoning
However, it would depend upon the nature of the case and the facts and circumstances and evidence in each case whether the confessional statement is truthful and is corroborated.	Reasoning
That has to be seen in each case.	Reasoning
In Parliament attack case (supra) certain observations have been made with respect to section 52(2) of POTA Act which specifically provided that the person arrested shall be informed of his right to consult a legal practitioner as soon as he is brought to the Police Station.	Reasoning
Section 52(3) provides that information of his arrest shall be given immediately to a family member or a relative.	None
Section 52(4) says that the person arrested shall be permitted to meet the legal practitioner representing him during the course of interrogation of the accused person.	None
In this context the observations have been made by this Court in Parliament attack case Parliament advisedly introduced a Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436, ordained safeguard which was substantially reiterated in Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani, (1978) 2 SCC 424 , by expressly enacting in subsections (2) and (4) of Section 52 the obligation to inform the arrestee of his right to consult a lawyer and to permit him to meet the lawyer.	None
The avowed object of such prescription was to introduce an element of a fair and humane approach to the prisoner in an otherwise stringent law with drastic consequences to the accused.	None
These provisions are not to be treated as empty formalities.	None
It cannot be said that the violation of these obligations under subsections (2) and (4) have no relation and impact on the confession.	None
It is too much to expect that a person in custody in connection with the POTA offences is supposed to know the fasciculus of the provisions of POTA regarding the confessions and the procedural safeguards available to him.	None
The presumption should be otherwise.	None
The lawyers presence and advice, apart from providing psychological support to the arrestee, would help him understand the implications of making a confessional statement before the police officer and also enable him to become aware of other rights such as the right to remain in judicial custody after being produced before the Magistrate.	None
The very fact that he will not be under the fetters of police custody after he is produced before the CJM pursuant to Section 32(4) would make him feel free to represent to the CJM about the police conduct or the treatment meted out to him.	None
The haunting fear of again landing himself into police custody soon after appearance before the CJM would be an inhibiting factor against speaking anything adverse to the police.	None
That is the reason why the judicial custody provision has been introduced in subsection (5) of Section 32.	None
The same objective seems to be at the back of subsection (3) of Section 164 CrPC, though the situation contemplated therein is somewhat different.	None
183.	None
The breach of the obligation of another provision, namely, subsection (3) of Section 52 which is modelled on D.K. Basu (supra) guidelines has compounded the difficulty in acting on the confession.	None
Section 52(3) enjoins that the information of arrest shall be immediately communicated by the police officer to a family member or in his absence, to a relative of such person by telegram, telephone or by any other means and this fact shall be recorded by the police officer under the signature of the person arrested.	None
PW 80 the IO under POTA merely stated that ?near relatives of the accused were informed about their arrest as I learnt from the record?.	None
He was not aware whether any record was prepared by the police officer arresting the accused as regards the information given to the relatives.	None
It is the prosecution case that Afzal?s relative by the name of Mohd.	None
Ghulam Bohra of Baramula was informed through phone.	None
No witness had spoken to this effect.	None
A perusal of the arrest memo indicates that the name of Ghulam Bohra and his phone number are noted as against the column ?relatives to be informed?.	None
Afzal?s arrest memo seems to have been attested by Gilani?s brother who according to the prosecution, was present at the police cell.	None
But, that does not amount to compliance with subsection (3) because he is neither family member nor relation, nor even known to be a close friend.	None
We are pointing out this lapse for the reason that if the relations had been informed, there was every possibility of those persons arranging a meeting with the lawyer or otherwise seeking legal advice.?	None
It is not the case of the accused that they were not given the right to consult legal practitioner when they were interrogated after arrest by the police under section 52 of the Act.	None
Section 52 of the POTA Act is extracted hereunder Arrest.(1)	None
Where a police officer arrests a person, he shall prepare a custody memo of the person arrested.	None
(2) The person arrested shall be informed of his right to consult a legal practitioner as soon as he is brought to the police station.	None
(3) Whenever any person is arrested, information of his arrest shall be immediately communicated by the police officer to a family member or in his absence to a relative of such person by telegram, telephone or by any other means and this fact shall be recorded by the police officer under the signature of the person arrested.	None
(4) The person arrested shall be permitted to meet the legal practitioner representing him during the course of interrogation of the accused person Provided that nothing in this subsection shall entitle the legal practitioner to remain present throughout the period of interrogation.	None
The observations made by this Court in Parliament attack case carry the case no further as the accused were having the legal assistance after their arrest and they were never deprived of the same, and it is not their case they had asked for lawyer?s assistance during the period of reflection before confessing and they were denied the same.	Reasoning
In the Parliament Attack case, the observation has been made by this Court in the light of the submission that the confession cannot be truly judged from the standpoint of probabilities and natural course of human conduct, though this Court has commented that they were plausible and persuasive.	None
The learned counsel appearing on behalf of accused has submitted that confession of a coaccused made under Section 32 of POTA is not admissible against anyone other than the maker.	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance has been placed on the Parliament Attack case, wherein this Court has observed thus Now, let us examine the question whether Section 32(1) of POTA takes within its sweep the confession of a coaccused.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 32(1) of POTA which makes the confession made to a highranking police officer admissible in the trial does not say anything explicitly about the use of confession made by a co accused.	Arguments of Respondent
The words in the concluding portion of Section 32(1) are ?shall be admissible in the trial of such person for an offence under this Act or the rules made thereunder.?	None
It is, however, the contention of the learned Senior Counsel Shri Gopal Subramanium that Section 32(1) can be so construed as to include the admissibility of confessions of the coaccused as well.	Arguments of Respondent
The omission of the words in POTA or co accused, abettor or conspirator following the expression in the trial of such person which are the words contained in Section 15(1) of TADA does not make a material difference, according to him.	Arguments of Respondent
It is his submission that the words co accused, etc. were included by the 1993 Amendment of TADA by way of abundant caution and not because the unamended section of TADA did not cover the confession of the co accused.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the learned Senior Counsel, the phrase shall be admissible in the trial of such person does not restrict the admissibility only against the maker of the confession.	Arguments of Respondent
It extends to all those who are being tried jointly along with the maker of the confession provided they are also affected by the confession.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel highlights the crucial words in the trial of such person and argues that the confession would not merely be admissible against the maker but would be admissible in the trial of the maker which may be a trial jointly with the other accused persons.	Arguments of Respondent
Our attention has been drawn to the provisions of CrPC and POTA providing for a joint trial in which the accused could be tried not only for the offences under POTA but also for the offences under IPC.	Arguments of Respondent
We find no difficulty in accepting the proposition that there could be a joint trial and the expression ?	Arguments of Respondent
the trial of such person?	Arguments of Respondent
may encompass a trial in which the accused who made the confession is tried jointly with the other accused.	Arguments of Respondent
From that, does it follow that the confession made by one accused is equally admissible against others, in the absence of specific words?	Arguments of Respondent
The answer, in our view, should be in the negative.	Arguments of Respondent
On a plain reading of Section 32(1), the confession made by an accused before a police officer shall be admissible against the maker of the confession in the course of his trial.	Arguments of Respondent
It may be a joint trial along with some other accused but, we cannot stretch the language of the section so as to bring the confession of the coaccused within the fold of admissibility.	Arguments of Respondent
Such stretching of the language of law is not at all warranted especially in the case of a law which visits a person with serious penal consequences vide the observations of Ahmadi, J. (as he then was) in Niranjan Singh Karam Singh Punjabi v. Jitendra Bhimraj Bijjaya, (1990) 4 SCC 76 , SCC at p. 86, which were cited with approval in Kartar Singh case.	Arguments of Respondent
We would expect a more explicit and transparent wording to be employed in the section to rope in the confession of the coaccused within the net of admissibility on a par with the confession of the maker.	Arguments of Respondent
An evidentiary rule of such importance and grave consequence to the accused could not have been conveyed in a deficient language.	Arguments of Respondent
It seems to us that a conscious departure was made by the framers of POTA on a consideration of the pros and cons, by dropping the words coaccused, etc.	Arguments of Respondent
These specific words consciously added to Section 15(1) by the 1993 Amendment of TADA so as to cover the confessions of the co accused would not have escaped the notice of Parliament when POTA was enacted.	Arguments of Respondent
Apparently, Parliament in its wisdom would have thought that the law relating to confession of the coaccused under the ordinary law of evidence, should be allowed to have its sway, taking a cue from the observations in Kartar Singh case at para 255.	Arguments of Respondent
The confession recorded by the police officer was, therefore, allowed to be used against the maker of the confession without going further and transposing the legal position that was obtained under TADA.	Arguments of Respondent
We cannot countenance the contention that the words ?coaccused?, etc. were added in Section 15(1) of TADA, ex majore cautela.	Arguments of Respondent
50.	None
We are, therefore, of the view that having regard to all these weighty considerations, the confession of a coaccused ought not to be brought within the sweep of Section 32(1).	Arguments of Respondent
As a corollary, it follows that the confessions of the first and second accused in this case recorded by the police officer under Section 32(1), are of no avail against the coaccused or against each other.	Arguments of Respondent
We also agree with the High Court that such confessions cannot be taken into consideration by the Court under Section 30 of the Evidence Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The reason is that the confession made to a police officer or the confession made while a person is in police custody, cannot be proved against such person, not to speak of the coaccused, in view of the mandate of Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act.	Arguments of Respondent
If there is a confession which qualifies for proof in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act, then, of course, the said confession could be considered against the coaccused facing trial under POTA.	Arguments of Respondent
But, that is not the case here.?	None
This Court has merely laid down that confession of accused is not admissible as against coaccused person and when TADA makes the confession against coaccused admissible, it could not be said that the words coaccused were added in Section 15(1) of TADA, ex majore cautela.	None
Through the expression, they were admissible against the accused has not been used in Section 32 of POTA.	Reasoning
It is relevant and admissible against the maker of it.	Reasoning
140.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, learned Solicitor General has relied upon the decision in Kehar Singh v. State (Delhi Administration), (1988) 3 SCC 609 , wherein this Court observed as under From an analysis of the section, it will be seen that Section 10 will come into play only when the court is satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence.	Arguments of Petitioner
There should be, in other words, a prima facie evidence that the person was a party to the conspiracy before his acts can be used against his coconspirator.	Arguments of Petitioner
Once such prima facie evidence exists, anything said, done or written by one of the conspirators in reference to the common intention, after the said intention was first entertained, is relevant against the others.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is relevant not only for the purpose of proving the existence of conspiracy but also for proving that the other person was a party to it.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is true that the observations of Subba Rao, J., in Sardar Sardul Singh Caveeshar v. State of Maharashtra, (1964) 2	Arguments of Petitioner
SCR 378 lend support to the contention that the admissibility of evidence as between coconspirators would be (sic more) liberal than in English law.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Judge said (SCR p. 390) ?	None
The evidentiary value of the said acts is limited by two circumstances, namely, that the acts shall be in reference to their common intention and in respect of a period after such intention was entertained by any one of them.	Arguments of Petitioner
The expression in reference to their common intention?	Arguments of Petitioner
is very comprehensive and it appears to have been designedly used to give it a wider scope than the words in furtherance of?	Arguments of Petitioner
in the English law with the result, anything said, done or written by a co conspirator, after the conspiracy was formed, will be evidence against the other before he entered the field of conspiracy or after he left it.??	None
In our opinion, there was no violation of safeguards provided under the provisions of section 32(5) vis a vis any accused person.	Reasoning
The confessions cannot be said to be inadmissible.	Reasoning
The provisions of section 32 have been duly complied with.	Reasoning
It was also submitted on behalf of accused persons that recording of confessions was flawed.	Reasoning
The accused were placed in seclusion and they were not informed of the time at which they would be summoned.	Reasoning
PW21 has admitted that none of them called him in between.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the time of reflection was granted which was adequate in this case and after giving an opportunity to accused whether they wanted to make a confession after being told that it may be used against them, it was the case of observance of the aforesaid principle and it is not the case that the accused had asked for legal assistance during that period and were deprived of it.	Reasoning
The legal aspect of the effect of confession had been duly informed to the accused persons beforehand in writing so many words, and adequate time was given for reflection so as to consider the consequence of making a confession.	Reasoning
Nothing more could have been advised by a lawyer.	Reasoning
Thus, by not volunteering to provide aid of lawyer in view of the fact that the case, where it was not asked for during the time of reflection, even on the assumption that it was necessary, no prejudice can be said to have been caused to any of the accused persons as they were given enough time for reflection, whether they wanted to make confession as it could be used against them.	Reasoning
Thus, there was no breach of any of the constitutional rights flowing from Articles 21, 22(3) and 20(3) of the Constitution of India.	Reasoning
As already mentioned that they were assisted by lawyers also in the main case when remand etc. was sought.	Reasoning
The submission that PW21 has stated that police custody has no relevance upon the voluntary nature of confession, which is as per counsel is against the settled jurisprudence, is also untenable for the reason that section 32 makes a voluntary confession to a police officer admissible.	Reasoning
It was also submitted on behalf of accused persons that the use of words like ?suraksha?, ?prabandh?, ?poorva?	Reasoning
netritva?	Reasoning
anusar?	Reasoning
hatya?	Arguments of Respondent
sampark, etc., which are highly Sanskritised words would never occur spontaneously to a Muslim of A1s background from the Deccan Hyderabad region.	Reasoning
Spontaneously to a Muslim like the background of A1 who hails from Hyderabad, and to other accused persons, the submission is not tenable.	Reasoning
It would depend on several factors.	Reasoning
Firstly, the aforesaid words cannot be said to be Sanskritised.	Reasoning
Secondly, it would depend upon the educational background of a Muslim in which he has been brought up.	Reasoning
Merely by the fact that A1 happens to be a Muslim, it cannot be said that he would not know these words, particularly when it would depend upon his own education and the family background in which he has been brought up.	Reasoning
There are highly cultured and literary families found in Muslims also who know several languages not only Urdu and are known for their Tehzeeb.	Reasoning
Thus the criticism made of the confessional statement due to use of the aforesaid words that they could not have been employed by A1 or by other accused persons is not only unwarranted but also unacceptable and the same is liable to be and is hereby rejected.	Reasoning
In the confessional statement accused have referred to mobile numbers cannot be said to be rendering it unreliable.	Reasoning
It is not uncommon to remember mobile numbers and to narrate them.	Reasoning
It was also submitted to discredit recording of the confessions by PW21 that it was not humanly possible to record confessions continuously for 37 hours.	Arguments of Respondent
Considering the chart which has been indicated is not for 39 hours as submitted.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted on behalf of the prosecution that the time taken by PW21 is not precise and the same has been calculated on the basis of the reflection time given to the accused.	None
PW21 in this regard has stated thus ?	None
227.	None
Exh. 228 and Ex. 229 had concluded just 4 hours before.	Arguments of Petitioner
A. It is true on seeing a record that accused Rehan statement was completed at 11.25 PM on 6.6.2003 whereas what I can see from the record (E. 232) that more than 16 hours have passed and therefore it cannot be said that recording of the confessional statement of accused Parvez had commenced exactly at 4 a.m.?	Arguments of Petitioner
The submission is based upon incorrect calculation and stands explained by the deposition of PW21.	None
The period of total recording is 20 to 22 hours and not 39 hours as attributed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The argument was raised that when accused asked for a glass of water, this renders the confessional statement unworthy of credence.	Reasoning
A police officer is not supposed to remember all these aspects and tell about them for several years and statements cannot be discredited on the ground whether the accused had asked for water or not.	Reasoning
It was also urged that Mohmed Parvez was produced at the Civil Hospital at the time when the statement was recorded, renders the confessional statement unreliable.	Arguments of Petitioner
No such question during his cross examination has been put to PW21 as to the presence of Parvez Sheikh, A9, in hospital at 10 a.m.	Arguments of Petitioner
A9 was required produced before the Magistrate on 9.6.2003 i.e. within 48 hours as required under section 32 of POTA.	Arguments of Petitioner
Neither he stated so in the written retraction of confessional statement that he was at the time in the hospital when the confessional statement is said to have been recorded.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was necessary to discredit the recording of confession by PW21 to put it in the crossexamination and to seek his explanation.	Arguments of Petitioner
Crossexamination is not a matter of procedure but a matter of substance as held in Maroti Bansi Teli v. Badhabai w o	Arguments of Petitioner
Tukaram Kunbi, AIR 1945 Nagpur 60, Karnidan Sarda v. Sailaja Kanta Mitra, AIR 1940 Patna 683, A.E.G. Carapiet v. A.Y. Derderian, AIR 61 Cal. 359, and Jai Shankar Prasad vs. State of Bihar, AIR 1963 SC 1906 .	None
With respect to retraction of the confessions by all the accused persons on the same day after a month, it is apparent from the reasons recorded by the court that they have given different reasons for retraction.	Reasoning
The court has individually heard each and every accused.	Reasoning
A1 has stated that his signatures had been obtained on the blank papers.	Reasoning
A2 has stated that was a fact that under fear of encounter, he has given the statement.	Reasoning
A2 says that confession has been forcibly obtained.	Reasoning
A4 says that he was forced to make the confession.	Reasoning
Similar is the statement of A5.	Reasoning
A6 says that he has not given any confessional statement, his signatures have been obtained.	Reasoning
A7 says that by hook or crook, he was asked to make this confession and was forced to make it.	Reasoning
A8 says that he was forced to make a confession.	Reasoning
When he refused to sign, blinds were applied for 2 days.	Reasoning
A 9 says that confession is forcible, he was compelled to sign.	Reasoning
He signed the written confession.	Reasoning
A12 says that his confession was forcible and was obtained under threat.	Reasoning
A13 also made a similar statement.	Reasoning
Thus, it is apparent that the accused persons have not retracted their confession at first opportunity when they were produced.	Reasoning
Reasons behind retraction also do not inspire confidence.	Reasoning
The details with which the confessional statements have been recorded after the observance of due safeguards and other corroborative evidence on record are indicative of the fact that reasons for retraction, as stated, are not correct.	Reasoning
There is no allegation that they were tortured by the police.	Reasoning
In the absence of the same, it does not inspire confidence that they have signed on blank papers, etc.	Reasoning
There was a general statement that they were under fear made by some of the accused persons.	Reasoning
The fact remains that the statements have been recorded by the S.P., a high ranking officer as envisaged under section 32 which cannot be lightly discredited in the facts and circumstances of the case.	None
In Mohmed Amin Anr.	None
v. Central Bureau of Investigation, 2008 (15) SCC 49	None
this Court observed If the confessions of the appellants are scrutinised in the light of the aboveenumerated factors, it becomes clear that the allegations made by them regarding coercion, threat, torture, etc. after more than one year of recording of confessions are an afterthought and products of the ingenuity of their advocates.	None
The statements made by them under Section 313 CrPC were also the result of afterthought because no tangible reason has been put forward by the defence as to why Appellants A4 to A8 did not retract from their confessions when they were produced before the Magistrate at Ahmedabad and thereafter despite the fact that they had access to legal assistance in more than one way.	None
Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not commit any error by relying upon the confessions of Appellants A4 to A8 and A10 and we do not find any valid ground to discard the confessions of Appellants A4 to A8 and A10.	None
Since there was no maltreatment, no manifest complaint of torture, confession appears to be voluntary and all the accused persons were sent to judicial custody.	None
Subsequent retraction of confession is of no consequence, the same is an afterthought.	None
It was urged by learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of CBI that A4 and A5 stand convicted in tiffin bomb case dated 29.5.2002 in which tiffin bombs were planted in buses going towards Hindu localities and the trial court has also convicted A1 along with A3 in conspiracy with other accused persons under section 307 read with section 120B IPC and section 3(3) of POTA Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Same forms part of the chain of criminal conspiracy to create terror in the community of Hindus which has led to the murder of Haren Pandya.	Arguments of Petitioner
The associated case also provides a link and part of the conspiracy to finish the Hindu leaders and to take revenge of post Godhra incidents.	Arguments of Petitioner
PW39 has also identified accused A1 and A3 in the TIP proceeding before the Executive Magistrate, PW14 on 6.6.2003.	None
We have to examine the submissions in light of the evidence that has been adduced with respect to the murder of Haren Pandya.	None
CONFESSION AND CORROBORATION	None
Since the decision was based on TADA, Section 120A of Indian Penal Code and Section 10 of Evidence Act, it is the decision in Parliament Attack case which has to provide a guide as it was on the provision of Section 32 of POTA.	None
It is contended by C.B.I. that confession of all the accused recorded under Section 32 of POTA are voluntary and thus can be relied upon.	Arguments of Petitioner
The confessions have been proved by Vinayak Prabhakar Apte, SP CBI (PW21).	Arguments of Petitioner

On 11.3.2003, Shafiuddin asked for medicine and while Jagdish Tiwari bent for taking out the medicine, A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) fired on him and the bullet went straight into his stomach.	None
He also fired a second shot, but the bullet could not come out.	None
Jagdish Tiwari hides behind the refrigerator.	None

It is stated that he was extremely annoyed with the maltreatment meted out to him after killing Haren Pandya, on writing to Rauf, he urged him that he should intimate Suleman at Pakistan that fact but the next day he did not receive any message and therefore, the next day he chose to go to Hyderabad.	None

On his way to Calcutta and Bangladesh from Hyderabad, the police caught him.	None
The confession was signed by him.	Reasoning
It was urged that confession of A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) lacks corroboration in material particulars.	Reasoning
A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) in his confession stated that he was standing at the spot from before.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similar is the statement of PW55.	Arguments of Petitioner
A1s confession does not mention the presence of an eyewitness.	Arguments of Petitioner
PW55 claims to have shouted out at him.	Arguments of Petitioner
Confession of accused A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) does not refer to rolling up of the window but speaks of Haren Pandya drinking water at the time of shooting.	Arguments of Petitioner
Jaise use Gadi khadi karke pani peene ke liye botal ka dhakkan khola main gadi ki taraf ghooma aur driver ki taraf se thoda khule sheeshe se Haren Pandya par panch fire kiye.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our opinion, the nonrecovery of a water bottle from the car is not at all material as it had nothing to do with the offence in question.	None
Every material found in the car was not required to be seized.	Reasoning
The witness PW55 has also said that Haren Pandya drank water from the bottle.	Reasoning
There is no contradiction as sought to be made out on behalf of the learned counsel appearing for A1.	None
Confession of A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) has been supported by various other evidence on the record like phone calls, recovery of the weapon, vehicle, hiring of rooms, etc.	None
It was submitted that conduct of A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) as stated in the confession does not inspire confidence.	Reasoning
There is no conceivable reason for preserving cartridge case and weapons and spending time which must be precious to a murderer for escaping from the spot.	Reasoning
It was not reasonable for the accused to preserve empty cartridges.	Reasoning
There was the possibility of their recovery from the place of occurrence.	Reasoning
In case he had thrown them at the place of occurrence, as such, in our opinion, it was not unusual for accused A1 to carry them and he wanted to run away from the spot also as such he did not waste time in throwing them on spot and leave the evidence.	Reasoning
On behalf of accused A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali), it was submitted that CBI case is that A9 had called A7 at 7.18 a.m. on 26.3.2003 to say that A1 has not arrived at Law Garden.	Arguments of Respondent
At 7.33 a.m., A1 had called A14 from some kilometers away from Law Garden after the murder.	Arguments of Respondent
At 8.17 a.m., A1 again called A14 from some 1517 km.	Arguments of Respondent
away.	Arguments of Respondent
It was further submitted that there is no evidence to show that these were phones used by A7 and A9 or A1 or to show the nature of the conversation save the confessions.	Arguments of Respondent
Even the cell location of one of those numbers is missing.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also submitted that taking this theory at face value it means that A1 did not reach the spot before 7.19 a.m. Also, he must necessarily have left the spot before 7.29 a.m. because it would take 45 minutes to reach the spot from which the call at 7.33 a.m. was made.	Arguments of Respondent
The time band for the murder is thus between 7.19 a.m. and 7.28 a.m. at the outer limit going by CBI case, it is even less if the confession is taken into account for that says that A1 wanted a few minutes before Mr. Pandya arrived After the incident, A1 (Mohmed Asghar Ali) called A14 Sohails Mobile No.9426039937 from His Mobile No.9825494421 at 7.33.27 a.m. and at 8.17 a.m., the location of these mobile phone confirms the presence of A1 Asghar Ali at Law Garden area.	Arguments of Respondent

On 26.3.2003 after the incident, the call was made to mobile of Sohail and it was said that the work was done.	None
CBI call records support the same.	None
In our opinion, it makes hardly any difference of one or two minutes when it is possible to travel the distance from where the calls were made by A1 to A14 in a few minutes and from distance of 15 to 17 km. calls in 45 minutes.	Reasoning
Cell phone location also supports the ocular version and lends credence to the fact that murder had taken at the place near Law Garden.	Reasoning
In addition, for tracking A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali), a landline at Nalgonda was used.	Reasoning
It was proved that A1 used phone No.9825494251.	Reasoning
In the confession also, the number has been stated.	Reasoning
Even on the next date of the incident, the phone was used by A1, stands established by the prosecution.	Reasoning

The said weapon was recovered at the instance of A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali) vide seizure memo Exhibit 196.	None
In view of overall evidence against him, we are of the view that his acquittal by High Court for murder of Haren Pandya and POTA offence deserves to be set aside and conviction and sentence as ordered by Trial Court is restored.	Reasoning
In Re A4 (Kalim Ahmad Karimi)	None
It was submitted by Shri Raju Ramachandran, learned senior counsel on behalf of A4 (Kalim Ahmad Karimi) that it is a case of conspiracy which is based entirely on confessions under POTA which were obtained after an unduly long period of police custody.	None
It is contended that colour of conspiracy is sought to be given solely by the use of confessions.	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance has been placed on Kehar Singh (supra), which has already been considered.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, reliance was placed on the decision of K.R. Purushothaman v. State of Kerala, (2005) 12 SCC 631 , wherein this Court observed as under ?13.	None
To constitute a conspiracy, meeting of minds of two or more persons for doing an illegal act or an act by illegal means is the first and primary condition and it is not necessary that all the conspirators must know each and every detail of the conspiracy.	None
Neither is it necessary that every one of the conspirators takes an active part in the commission of each and every conspiratorial acts.	Arguments of Respondent
The agreement amongst the conspirators can be inferred by necessary implication.	Arguments of Respondent
In most of the cases, the conspiracies are proved by the circumstantial evidence, as the conspiracy is seldom an open affair.	Arguments of Respondent
The existence of conspiracy and its objects are usually deduced from the circumstances of the case and the conduct of the accused involved in the conspiracy.	Arguments of Respondent
While appreciating the evidence of the conspiracy, it is incumbent on the court to keep in mind the wellknown rule governing circumstantial evidence viz.	Arguments of Respondent
each and every incriminating circumstance must be clearly established by reliable evidence and the circumstances proved must form a chain of events from which the only irresistible conclusion about the guilt of the accused can be safely drawn, and no other hypothesis against the guilt is possible.	Arguments of Respondent
Criminal conspiracy is an independent offence in the Penal Code.	Arguments of Respondent
The unlawful agreement is sine qua non for constituting an offence under the Penal Code and not an accomplishment.	Arguments of Respondent
Conspiracy consists of the scheme or adjustment between two or more persons which may be express or implied or partly express and partly implied.	Arguments of Respondent
Mere knowledge, even discussion, of the plan would not per se constitute conspiracy.	Arguments of Respondent
The offence of conspiracy shall continue till the termination of agreement.?	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Senior Counsel has further relied upon the decision of Central Bureau of Investigation, Hyderabad v. K. Narayana Rao, (2012) 9 SCC 512 , in which this Court opined thus ?	None
24.	None
The ingredients of the offence of criminal conspiracy are that there should be an agreement between the persons who are alleged to conspire and the said agreement should be for doing of an illegal act or for doing, by illegal means, an act which by itself may not be illegal.	None
In other words, the essence of criminal conspiracy is an agreement to do an illegal act and such an agreement can be proved either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or by both and in a matter of common experience that direct evidence to prove conspiracy is rarely available.	Arguments of Respondent
Accordingly, the circumstances proved before and after the occurrence have to be considered to decide about the complicity of the accused.	Arguments of Respondent
Even if some acts are proved to have been committed, it must be clear that they were so committed in pursuance of an agreement made between the accused persons who were parties to the alleged conspiracy.	Arguments of Respondent
Inferences from such proved circumstances regarding the guilt may be drawn only when such circumstances are incapable of any other reasonable explanation.	Arguments of Respondent
In other words, an offence of conspiracy cannot be deemed to have been established on mere suspicion and surmises or inference which are not supported by cogent and acceptable evidence.?	Arguments of Respondent
It is contended that CBI seeks to reverse the acquittal, where High Court has rejected the confessions on the basis of law laid down by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further submitted that reversal of an acquittal should not be done when the view taken by the High Court is a possible view and as such, no interference should be made as per the parameter laid down in State of Rajasthan v. Islam Ors., (2011) 6 SCC 343 , in which this Court observed ?	Arguments of Respondent
16.	None
The principle to be followed by the appellate court considering an appeal against an order of acquittal is to interfere only when there are compelling and substantial reasons to do so.	None
Thus, in such cases, this Court would usually not interfere unless (i)	None
The finding is vitiated by some glaring infirmity in the appraisal of evidence.	None

(vii) The High Court has completely misdirected itself in reversing the order of conviction by the trial court.	Arguments of Respondent
(Gauri Shanker Sharma v. State of U.P., (1990) Supp.	Arguments of Respondent
SCC 656) (viii)	None
The judgment is tainted with serious legal infirmities.	Arguments of Respondent
(State of Maharashtra v. Narsingrao Gangaram Pimple, (1984) 1 SCC 446 at SCC para 45 AIR para 45.)	None
17.	None
In reversing an acquittal, this Court keeps in mind that presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is fortified by an order of acquittal and if the view of the High Court is reasonable and founded on materials on record, this Court should not interfere.	None
However, if this Court is of the opinion that the acquittal is not based on a reasonable view, then it may review the entire material and there will be no limitation on this Court?s jurisdiction under Article 136 to come to a just decision quashing the acquittal.	Arguments of Respondent
See State (Delhi Admn.)	Arguments of Respondent
v. Laxman Kumar, (1985) 4 SCC 476 at SCC para 45 and Dharma v. Nirmal Singh, (1996) 7 SCC 471 at SCC para 4.?	None
This Court has cautioned that if the view of the High Court is not reasonable, this Court may review entire material and there will be no limitation on the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 136 to render justice quashing the acquittal.	Arguments of Respondent

It is further contended that call records of accused are inadmissible in view of Section 65B of Indian Evidence Act, 1872.	None
It proves nothing against accused as they knew each other and thus their presence in the same vicinity or having talked with each other should not arouse any suspicion.	None
The BSNL call records are clearly not computergenerated owing to the random order of dates and missing pieces of information and in terms of Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the records cannot be said to be reproduced from the original computer.	None

With regard to recovery of pistol carried by A6 (Mohmed Yunus Sareswala), it is contended that it was not recovered at the instance of A6 (Mohmed Yunus Sareswala), but from the purported disclosure made by A1 (Mohmed Asgar Ali), which only binds the maker of the statement and cannot be used against A6 (Mohmed Yunus Sareswala).	Arguments of Respondent
It is inadmissible under Section 27 of the Evidence Act against A6 (Mohmed Yunus Sareswala) as it only binds the maker of the disclosure.	Arguments of Respondent

The CDR (Exhibit 310) has failed to show the location of the number which was being used by A7 (Rehan Puthawala) on 26.3.2003 and the CDR was inadmissible in evidence.	Arguments of Respondent
The allegation against the accused was far from the truth and also baseless.	Reasoning

There is a doubt as to whether A7 (Rehan Puthawala) approached him for a false number plate of the motorcycle.	Reasoning

The motorcycle was stolen one and fake number plates have been discovered from the bushes near Tarapur Highway.	Reasoning
It was A10 (Parvez Khan Pathan) who left the motorcycle at Tarapur Highway in the bush.	Reasoning
The recovery of the motorcycle is proved by Bhagwan Singh Rathod (PW50) corroborated by Alpesh Ranchhodbhai Rathod (PW86  the panch witness) and by deposition of Investigating Officer, CBI and Dr. Sushilkumar S. Gupta (PW120).	Reasoning
The vehicle was used in killing Haren Pandya and the fake number plate was put by the accused so as to save themselves from the clutches of law and prevent identification.	Reasoning
The guilt stand proved against the A7 (Rehan Puthawala) as found established by the Trial Court.	Reasoning
The conviction and sentence imposed by the Trial Court on Rehan Puthawala is found to be proper under section 3(1) and 3(3) of POTA as well as section 120B r w section 302 IPC for commission of murder of Haren Pandya.	Reasoning
IN RE A8 (MOHMED RIYAZ GORU)	None

It is also averred that alterations were made in the job workbook of Star Number Plate.	Arguments of Respondent
There is no independent evidence linking the number plate to the offence.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further submitted that prosecution has picked up abandoned bikes already in the local police custody and foisted the same on the accused.	Arguments of Respondent
Each motorcycle recovered is the planted recovery and has been falsely connected to this case.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further submitted that there is no independent evidence to establish the connection of motorcycle recovered by PS Koth, which CBI claimed to be connected with number plate 5189, with the offence.	Arguments of Respondent
The discrepancies as to the presence or absence of a number plate on the motorcycle in the panchnama and in the testimony of Sushilkumar S. Gupta (PW120) creates suspicion.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further urged that on account of broadcast in May 2003, the CBI came to know about the motorcycle being at PS Koth.	Arguments of Respondent
This broadcast indicates that CBI was aware of the motorcycle in the month of May itself and the recovery of the motorcycle from PS Koth on 12.6.2003 was choreographed to suit the case of the prosecution.	Arguments of Respondent
Despite Court?s directions, no broadcast documents have been produced.	Arguments of Respondent
It is stated that motorcycle having number plate 8973 was recovered from the parking of Apsara Cinema by Kagdapeeth PS on 9/10.4.2003 and it was seized by CBI on 25.4.2003.	Arguments of Respondent
However, Javed Abdul Rashidkhan Pathan (PW45) denies being shown the motorcycle at Kagdapeeth PS and also states that CBI did not seize it in his presence.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also contended that original owner Ashokbhai Ambalal Shah (PW36) of the above motorcycle has deposed that from 24.12.2002 i.e., the day he filed a complaint of theft of motorcycle till 4.5.2003, he regularly visited (every 1530 days) the Kagdapeeth PS to inquire about his stolen motorcycle.	Arguments of Respondent
It is, thus, completely incomprehensible as to why Amduji Pabji Chavda (PW46) did not inform him immediately when the bike was recovered.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further alleged that Bhagwan Singh Samantsinh Rathod (PW50) has categorically stated that broadcast made in May 2003 about the recovered motorcycle indicates that CBI was aware of the motorcycle at the time of recovery of the number plate and fabricated a connection between the two later.

This explains the socalled delay and explains the situation of the spot and due to dark glasses, it may not have been possible for the passerby immediately to take note of the fact that as to what had happened inside the car, which was parked on the side of Chitty Bang.	Reasoning
Thus, the submission on behalf of accused persons cannot be accepted and the evidence discloses that family members of Haren Pandya, his P.A., and other political leaders had also arrived in the meantime at the spot on coming to know of the incident.	None
In view of overall evidence available against the accused he was rightly held guilty by Trial Court for offence under section 3(1) and section 3(3) of POTA as well as under section 120B and section 120B read with section 302 IPC for murder of Haren Pandya.	Decision
The conviction and sentence imposed by Trial Court is restored.	Decision
IN RE ACCUSED NO.2 (MOHMED ABDUL RAOUF)	None
Mohmed Abdul Raouf, son of Mohmed Abdul Kadar was held guilty by the Trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 3(3) of POTA and was given benefit of doubt of all the other offences under the POTA as well as under the IPC.	None
There is no appeal preferred against his acquittal by the State CBI in the High Court.	None
Now, the question remains that of the sentence to be imposed under Section 3(3) of POTA.	None
The Trial Court has convicted A2 (Mohmed Raouf) under Section 3(3) of POTA and sentenced him to 7 years rigorous imprisonment and the High Court has also confirmed and maintained the conviction as well as the amount of fine i.e., Rs.10,000/.	Reasoning
The sentence of rigorous imprisonment has been modified to the period already undergone in jail i.e., 5 years.	Reasoning
Against the decision of the High Court, the CBI is in appeal.	Reasoning
The minimum sentence is 5 years under Section 3(3) of POTA and by now 8 years have passed and the accused has already undergone little more than 5 years.	Reasoning
No case for further interference is called for as CBI did not prefer an appeal against the judgment and order of the Trial Court.	Reasoning
The decision of the High Court as to conviction and sentence under POTA is affirmed.	Reasoning
IN RE A3 (MOHMED SHAFIUDDIN)	None
With respect to A3 (Mohmed Shafiudding), the Trial Court has recorded conviction under Section 120B read with Section 307 of IPC and has sentenced him to undergo 7 years rigorous imprisonment with fine of Rs.3,000.	None
He was also given benefit of doubt for all the other offences he had been charged with under the POTA as well as under the IPC.	None
The High Court has also maintained and upheld conviction and sentence awarded to him by the Trial Court.	None
As no appeal was preferred by CBI against the decision of the Trial Court against A3 (Mohmed Shafiuddin), no case for further interference is made out.	Reasoning
IN RE A12 (SHAHNAVAZ GANDHI)	None
With respect to A12 (Shahnavaz Gandhi), he was convicted only under Section 3(3) of POTA and was sentenced by the Trial Court to undergo 5 years rigorous imprisonment.	None
The High Court has confirmed and maintained the conviction and sentence awarded under Section 3(3) of POTA.	Reasoning
No appeal was preferred by CBI against the acquittal A2 (Mohmed Abdul Raouf), A3 (Mohmed Shafiuddin) and A12 (Shahnavaz Gandhi) and since they have completed the sentence fully awarded to them by the Trial Court as modified by the High Court in the case of A2 (Mohmed Abdul Raouf), no further interference is required to be made as against them in the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed and it need not be discussed elaborately as no appeal was preferred against the decision of the Trial Court by CBI.	None
IN RE CRIMINAL APPEAL NO./2019 SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.)	Decision
NO.5530 OF 2017 AND CRIMINAL APPEAL NO./2019 SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.)	Decision
NOS.90289029 OF 2016 Leave granted.	None
As accused absconded, separate trial was held with respect to Mohd.	None
Junaid Sheikh.	None
In addition to the aforesaid charges for the murder of Haren Pandya and attempt to kill Jagdish Tiwari under POTA the accused Mohd.	None
Junaid Sheikh was also prosecuted under Section 174 A of Indian Penal Code (for short, ?the IPC?) as he had absconded.	Facts
A separate trial was held wherein he had been acquitted by the trial court for commission of the offence with respect to the attempt of murder of Jagdish Tiwari and murder of Haren Pandya but has been convicted for commission of the offence under section 174A of the IPC.	Facts
The trial court has convicted the accused for the said offence under section 174A IPC in Case No.10 of 2003 vide separate judgment and order dated 28.02.2008.	Facts
On appeal filed by the accused, the High Court acquitted the accused and modified the sentence by imposing fine of Rs. 21 lakhs and in breach of default of payment of fine the sentence imposed by the trial court shall stand.	Facts
The amount of fine has been deposited.	Facts
On being aggrieved, the CBI has filed the appeals.	Facts
Though, in the instant case, the trial court has found that attempt on the life of Jagdish Tiwari and the murder of Haren Pandya has been committed in the method and manner as per prosecution case.	Reasoning
However, with regard to present accused M.J. Sheikh, it has been held that the prosecution has not been able to prove his guilt beyond the periphery of doubt.	Reasoning
As per prosecution case, he is stated to have stayed in Mumbai in the place of Mufti Sufian, the trial court has found that though his visit to Mumbai with Mufti Sufian stands proved, any conspiracy was formed at Mumbai had not been established.	Facts
His statement under section 164 (1) Cr.P.C. initially was recorded as a witness that has not been taken into consideration.	Facts
The polygraph test conducted on the accused was not as per the laid down safeguards to be observed by the National Human Rights Commission and was without any permission of the court.	Facts
Even the statement had been held to be not good enough to fasten the guilt to enter into the conspiracy for either an attempt of murder of Mr. Jagdish Tiwari or killing of Haren Pandya.	Facts
He was not with the main accused Mohmed Asgar Ali on the date of the incident and while he was running from place to place after committing murder of Haren Pandya, he is said to have stayed for three days in the accommodation which was taken from the accused M.J. Sheikh at the instance of the Mufti Sufian.	Facts
No role has been shown of the accused in the conspiracy leading to the attempt of murder of Mr. Jagdish Tiwari and killing of Haren Pandya.	Facts
Maybe subsequent stay at the house that too when the house has been obtained by Mufti Sufian and since the accused M.J. Sheikh was close to Mufti Sufian he has taken his car to bring the A1 to the accommodation cannot make him conspirator in the murder of Haren Pandya since it was a subsequent event.	Facts
The phone calls made to Mufti Sufian by the accused are not significant since the witness was known to Mufti Sufian and he handed him Rs.15,000 to Rs.20,000 for visit to Haj which amount was paid back, as such it has been inferred by the trial court that the same is not the case for funding for creating terror.	Facts
Apart from that, after tiffin bomb accident the conspiracy was hatched to kill Jagdish Tiwari and Haren Pandya to which the accused was not a part.	Facts
The High Court had not disturbed the aforesaid finding.	Facts
We have gone through the judgment of the trial court and the evidence on record adduced in this case.	Decision
We are satisfied that the benefit of the doubt has been rightly extended by the Trial Court.	Decision
In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, as the petitioner has already served the sentence of 17 months and has also paid the fine of Rs.21 lakhs, thus, no case for interference is made out visvis to him.	Decision
The appeals are accordingly, disposed of.	Decision

Mr. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General has submitted that the petition filed by the father of the deceased seeking investigation had been dismissed by the Gujarat High Court way back in 2008, the special leave petition against the same was also dismissed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thereafter wife of deceased also filed a petition in the year 2012 in the Gujarat High Court which was also dismissed inter alia on the aforesaid grounds that judicial propriety and discipline oust the High Court from entering into merits as this Court has to reassess the evidence and the findings recorded by the Gujarat High Court in the criminal appeals.	Arguments of Petitioner
Which have been heard finally by this Court and hearing concluded on 31.1.2019.	Arguments of Petitioner
The petition is not maintainable and has been filed with an oblique motive.	Arguments of Petitioner
The statement of Azam Khan is an afterthought and did not relate to the matter in question in the case in which he has deposed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Forum of PIL is being misused.	Arguments of Petitioner
It cannot be based on newspaper reports or reports in the magazines.	Arguments of Petitioner
For this purpose, he has relied upon Kusum Lata v. Union of India, (2006) 6 SCC 180 , Rohit Pandey v. Union of India (2005) 13 SCC 702 and Holicow Pictures (Private) Ltd. v. Prem Chandra Mishra, 2007 (14) SCC 281.	Arguments of Petitioner

Reliance has been placed on Gulzar Ahmed Azmi v. Union of India (2012) 10 SCC 731 , and Ashok Kumar Pandey v. State of West Bengal, (2004) 3 SCC 349.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Mehta has also relied upon a recent decision of this Court in Tehseen Poonawasla v. Union of India, (2018) 6 SCC 72 , to submit that the instant case is nothing but misuse of PIL by the petitioners.	Arguments of Petitioner
As the writ petition has been filed on 22.1.2014 when this Court was finally hearing the criminal appeals with effect from December 2018 and most of documents and grounds taken are similar as such, during the course of hearing we asked Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that when criminal appeals were being heard by this Court at that time on the basis of almost the same grounds why PIL has been filed.	Reasoning
In case it was felt necessary that further investigation is required, why an application was not filed seeking further investigation or reinvestigation in the matter by the concerned persons or by CPIL and how the very same documents have been obtained and filed in the petition which forms part of the criminal appeal.	Reasoning
Mr. Prashant Bhushan admitted that certain documents have been supplied by learned counsel who is appearing on behalf of the accused persons respondents in criminal appeals.	Reasoning
He had consultations with said counsel to file the petition.	Reasoning
It was considered appropriate to file a separate petition.	Reasoning
We are not happy the way in which the writ petition has been filed.	Reasoning
It has been filed acting obviously in conjunction with the accused persons in the case as the counsel for accused has admittedly supplied the documents to the petitioner and had consultations.	Reasoning
It was also pointed out by Mr. Tushar Mehta that presence of the counsel appearing on behalf of CPIL and one of them appearing for the accused, has also been recorded in the writ petition in the order dated 8.2.2019.	Reasoning
A perusal of the order dated 8.2.2019 indicates that the presence of the counsel for an accused in criminal appeals has been recorded on behalf of the petitioner CPIL along with Mr. Prashant Bhushan and Mr. Rohit K Singh, advocates.	Reasoning
Mr. Prashant Bhushan tried to explain the aforesaid position on the ground that his clerk has wrongly given the appearance of said learned counsel who is appearing on behalf of an accused person in criminal appeals.	Reasoning
However, as admitted by Mr. Prashant Bhushan, the said counsel was associated with him in furnishing the information, documents, etc. Be that as it may.	Reasoning
The fact is apparent that accused persons were instrumental in getting filed this writ petition for further investigation in the case.	Reasoning
If the accused so wanted then they ought to have approached this Court by way of filing an appropriate application in the criminal appeals only and not by way of filing a PIL, that too through the CPIL.	Reasoning
It cannot be said to be an appropriate way of filing a writ petition for further investigation, the motive is oblique, improper and against discipline, especially when the criminal appeals were being heard finally and this Court was in seisin of the matter and judgment has been reserved ultimately on 31.1.2019.	Reasoning
At the relevant time when the petition was filed, obviously the petitioner CPIL was well aware of the hearing of criminal appeals and that fact has not been stated in the writ petition that criminal appeals were being heard on merits for the last several months w.e.f. 1.11.2018.	Reasoning
It is shocking and surprising that the accused have resorted to the aforesaid method of getting filed the petition in guise of the PIL by supplying the documents to CPIL in their selfinterest and virtually attacking the case of the prosecution on the same grounds and whatever new material has been filed, we will discuss the value of the same hereafter.	Reasoning
Statement of Mohd.	Reasoning
Azam Khan who was examined as a witness in Sessions Case No.177/2013 etc. has been relied on, it was stated by him that Sohrabuddin told him that Shahid Rampuri, Naeem Khan and he got a contract to kill Haren Pandya and they had killed him.	Reasoning
He felt sad and told Sohrabuddin that they have killed a good person.	Reasoning
Thereafter Sohrabuddin told him that this contract of killing was given by Mr. Vanzara.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the aforesaid statement made by Azam Khan was totally out of the context of a criminal case in which he had deposed.	Reasoning
It was clearly an attempt as an afterthought to make the statement as to some other matter irrelevant to controversy.	Reasoning
In the crossexamination of the witness in para 3, he has made the following statement The CBI officer recorded my statement twice in the year 2010.	None
I told before the CBI officer the entire story of my leaving Udaipur for Pratapgarh and from there to come back to Udaipur and then to visit Hyderabad to meet Shahid Rampuri in jail and Naeem Khan at Hyderabad and to assured Naeem Khan to supply AK 56 weapons to him and then come to Indore and again Udaipur and to stay with Sohrabuddin at Udaipur as said by me in my examination in chief.	None
The reason for the omission of this story by CBI might be when I told before them the story of the killing of the Home Minister Hariyan Pandya.	None
I told before the CBI officer about my discussion with Sohrabuddin at his house at Udaipur and the killing of the Home Minister Shri Hariyan Pandya by Tulsiram and one boy at the instance of Sohrabuddin and killing of Hamid Lala by Tulsiram and Mudassar at the instance of Sohrabuddin.	None
There is no reason for this omission in my statement recorded by CBI.	None
I told before the CBI officer that in order to recover the money of Rajasthan Tools Company Jodhpur from Mariam Marble, I was falsely booked in an extortion case.	None
There is no reason for the above omission in my statement before CBI.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
Azam Khan has stated that CBI recorded his statement twice in the year 2010, but he was unable to give any reason for omission in his statement recorded by the CBI.	Reasoning
Even otherwise the statement made after more than 15 years is wholly unreliable and an afterthought and was not connected with the matter in question in which it was made.	Reasoning
Thus, it appears to be clearly a motivated one and bundle of falsehood as he could not give any reason for omission in the previous statement in which also this issue was not involved.	Reasoning
A book by Ms. Rana Ayyub has also been relied upon in which it has been observed that Haren Pandya?s case is like a volcano. ?	Reasoning
Once the truth is out, (xxx) will go home.	Reasoning
He will be jailed.?	Reasoning
The counsel has further relied upon an article in the Outlook based upon the statement of Mr. Vithal Pandya, father of Haren Pandya.	Reasoning
It appears from that he entertained a doubt as to the actual killer, but with no material against anybody.	Reasoning
The Book by Rana Ayyub is of no utility.	Reasoning
It is based upon surmises, conjectures, and suppositions and has no evidentiary value.	Reasoning
The opinion of a person is not in the realm of the evidence.	Reasoning
There is a likelihood of the same being politically motivated, cannot be ruled out.	Reasoning
The way in which the things have moved in Gujarat post Godhra incident, such allegations and counterallegations are not uncommon and had been raised a number of times and have been found to be untenable and afterthought.	Reasoning
Coming to the allegations made by the family of the deceased, by father of Haren Pandya, Mr. Vithal Pandya and Ms. Jagruti Ben, wife of the deceased, the matter has been dealt with on merits by Gujarat High Court in the petition which was filed on behalf of Mr. Vithal Bhai Pandya.	None
A Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat has considered the matter in extensive details.	None
It was urged that Ms. Jagrutiben Pandya, wife of deceased Haren Pandya was cited as a witness in the charge sheet.	None
On 16.11.2006, the prosecution submitted closing pursis and pursis for dropping of the witnesses including Jagrutiben Pandya.	None
It was taken note of the fact that the applicant did not challenge the order passed declining further investigation.	None
A similar application was submitted on 18.12.2006 on the basis of newspaper reports which was also dismissed on 25.6.2007 by the POTA Judge.	None
A copy of the order was also supplied to the applicant, wife of the deceased.	None
Thereafter, father of deceased has filed a petition in the High Court assailing the order which was decided vide judgment and order dated 20.6.2008.	None
A Division Bench of the High Court of Gujarat has observed thus ?	None
24.	None
At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the respective appeals, the applicant who is neither a witness nor a complainant, has challenged three different orders namely 1 order dtd.18/12/2006 passed below application Ex.855 2 order dtd.26/3/2007 passed below application Ex.898 3 final judgement and order of conviction dtd.25/6/2007 passed by the learned Special Court in Special Case POTA No.10 of 2003.	None
Vide order dtd.18/12/2006 passed below application Ex.855 and order dtd.26/3/2007 passed below application Ex.898, the learned Special Court POTA has dismissed the said applications submitted by the applicant for reinvestigation further investigation of the case related to the murder of the son of the applicant namely Mr. Haren Pandya.	None
It is also required to be noted at this stage that at the time when the first application Ex.855 was submitted by the applicant for further investigation reinvestigation, the same was after 122 prosecution witnesses and 7 defence witnesses were already examined by the Special Court POTA and further statements of the accused running into 202 pages had already been recorded and the trial was at the fag end.	None
Even when the application Ex.898 came to be dismissed by the learned Special Court POTA on 26/3/2007	None
it was specifically observed by the learned trial court that the applicant be supplied copy of the said order urgently to enable him to approach the higher forum if he so chooses, as there is still some time before the Court shall deliver the judgment after completing the submissions of both the sides on 28/3/2007 and 4/4/2007.	None
It is borne out from the record that the order passed below application Ex.855 dtd.18/12/2006 was sent to the applicant on 22/12/2006 and the copy of the order passed blow application Ex.898 dtd.26/3/2007 was received by the applicant on the very day i.e. on 26/3/2007.	None
In the order dtd.26/3/2007, it was specifically observed by the learned Special Jude that the applicant shall also be provided legal aid service to approach the Honble High Court if he so desires.	None
Still, the applicant did not challenge the aforesaid two orders immediately.	None
It appears that the submissions arguments of both the sides were heard on 28/3/2007 and 4/4/2007.	None
Thereafter, final judgment and order of conviction convicting the accused persons is passed by the learned Special Court POTA on 25/6/2007 and all the aforesaid orders came to be challenged by the applicant in the month of November 2007.	None
Thus, it appears that the applicant has either not taken the matter very seriously in challenging the aforesaid orders passed below application Ex.855 and 898 immediately and or within a reasonable time and allowed the trial to be proceeded and concluded.	None
It is also required to be noted at this stage that the applicant has specifically averred in the Appeal Memo challenging the final judgment and order dtd.25/6/2007 that he is not challenging the final judgment and order of conviction dtd.25/6/2007 convicting the accused persons.	None
If that is so, in that case, as such, the appeal against the final judgment and order dtd.25/6/2007 under Section 34 of the POTA would not be maintainable, an order of conviction is not challenged.	None
26.	None
In support of his prayer for further investigation and or reinvestigation of the murder of Mr. Haren Pandya it is alleged that the same was a political murder.	None
It is submitted by the applicant that the applicant was not cited as a witness in the charge sheet and that the Jagrutiben widow of deceased Haren Pandya though was cited as a witness, but was dropped.	None
As stated above, the charge sheet was filed on 8/9/2003 and the applicant was not cited as a witness.	None
Still, the applicant did not do anything.	None
Closing pursis and the pursis for dropping of the witness was submitted by the learned Special Public Prosecutor on 16/11/2006 and the certified copy of the said pursis was applied by the applicant on 16/4/2007 which was actually delivered to the applicant on 25/4/2007.	None
Still, the applicant did not challenge the orders passed below applications Ex.855 and 898 and allowed the trial to be concluded.	None
It also appears that even the averments made in the applications explaining the delay are too vague and or general in nature.	None
Even the applicant has not stated correct facts with respect to the receipt of copies of the orders passed below applications Ex.855 and 898 and the certified copy of the closing pursis for dropping of the witnesses.	None
27.	None
Still construing the sufficient cause?	None
liberally, so as to advance substantial justice and with a view to see that the meritorious case is not defeated on the technical ground of delay, we have considered prima facie case on merits also.	None
The learned senior advocate appearing on behalf of the applicant as well as learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on behalf of the CBI have addressed the court on merits also and we have heard the learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties on merits at length to appreciate the prima facie case on merits with a view to advance substantial justice and to see that the meritorious case is not defeated on the technical ground of delay.

It is further submitted that Jagrutiben widow of Haren Pandya was already cited as a witness in the charge sheet, still, she was not examined as a witness and she was dropped as a witness.	None
It is submitted that if she would have been examined as a witness, the truth might have come out.	None
It is submitted that even Jagrutiben in her interview published in Tahelka?	None
on 19/8/2006 apprehended that she would not be examined as a witness and it has come true.?	None
The High Court has further observed that nonexamination of Jagrutiben is no ground for further investigation.	Reasoning
The High Court has also observed that in the interview published in Tehelka?	Reasoning
on 19.8.2006, it is clearly admitted by Ms. Jagrutiben that she has no proof material with respect to political rivalry.	Reasoning
Only on allegation of political rivalry, further investigation or reinvestigation cannot be ordered.	Reasoning
The I.O. has stated that during the investigation he did not get any material with respect to political rivalry on the basis of the vague statement of Mr. Vithalbhai Pandya, father of deceased, further investigation was not possible to be ordered against political figures.	Reasoning
The applicant has no material to substantiate the material of political rivalry.	Reasoning
In the absence of material, there cannot be an order for further investigation or reinvestigation.	Reasoning
On merit, the applicant has failed to make out a case for further investigation or reinvestigation.	Reasoning
Coming back to Jagrutiben, she was not an eyewitness, admittedly, and has no personal knowledge and it is apparent from the report she has stated that the deceased left the house for a morning walk at around 0645 hours/0700 hours.	Reasoning
Thus, the doubt raised in the newspaper report was that it would not have taken half an hour to reach the Law Garden.	Reasoning
It would have taken 10 minutes to reach Law Garden.	Reasoning
The submission of dropping of Jagrutiben is too tenuous to be accepted.	Reasoning
She has not unfolded any story regarding the real assailants to be someone else and in case she would have been examined, her statement would have supported the case of the prosecution that deceased had left the house in the morning only for a walk.	Reasoning
The assessment of the time may differ by 15 to 20 minutes also or even half an hour.	Reasoning
On the basis of approximation of the time by Jagrutiben in the newspaper reports and on the basis whereof the happening at Law Garden at 7.30 a.m. cannot be doubted at all.	Reasoning
Deceased Haren Pandya had as per her version left for Law Garden.	Reasoning
She was not an eyewitness to be examined in the case.	Reasoning
Thus, it cannot be said that the prosecution has withheld her and she would have unfolded any part story which was material to the case.	Reasoning
The SLP against the aforesaid decision in the case of Vithal Bhai of the Gujarat High Court has been dismissed by this Court on 15.7.2009.	Reasoning
This Court condoned the delay and dismissed the SLP.	Reasoning
Thus, the order passed by the High Court that no investigation was warranted, has attained finality.	Reasoning
Thereafter, yet another attempt had been made by the wife of the deceased though she was not entitled to file any petition after it was filed by the father of the deceased in view of prayer made before the Trial Court as father had questioned the orders passed on applications filed by her before Trial Court.	None
Nonetheless, she filed Special Crl.	None
Application No.2327/2011 which was decided vide order dated 6.2.2012.	None
The High Court of Gujarat has dismissed the petition filed by the wife and observed ?	None
4.	None
Mr. J.M. Panchal, learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing for the State of Gujarat has, relying upon the affidavit dated 4.2.2012 filed on behalf of the State of Gujarat, virtually reiterated, apart from reappreciation of evidence, the factum about pendency of SLPs arising out of the judgment and order dated 29.8.2011 rendered by this Hon?ble Court in Crl.	None
Appeal No.975 of 2007 and allied appeals.	None
It is further submitted that similar petition and prayer made earlier by the fatherinlaw of the petitioner for further investigation reinvestigation below Exh.855 and Exh.898 in Special Case POTA No.10 of 2003 came to be rejected by the Designated Trial Court and further Criminal Appeal Nos.17 of 2008, 18 of 2008 and 1324 of 2007 preferred along with delay condonation application before this Court also came to be rejected by a Division Bench after condoning the delay as per C.A.V. Judgment dated 16.6.2008 and, therefore, in such a scenario, when the subject matter is pending before the Apex Court in Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Crl) No(s) 9785 9796/2011 and Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Crl) No(s) 97979808/2011, in all propriety and judicial discipline, it is desirable that this Court may not exercise extraordinary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	None
5.	None
Admittedly, the above factual aspects remain uncontroverted as submitted by the State Counsel.	None
6.	None
Primafacie, the subject matter, and prayer of this petition are emanating from the proceedings pending before the Apex Court in Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Crl) No(s)	None
97859796/2011 filed by the State of Gujarat and Petition(s) for Special Leave to Appeal (Crl) No(s) 9797 9708/2011 filed by the CBI.	None
Under the circumstances, at this stage, entertaining this petition for seeking a direction to reinvestigate for further investigation of the offences would be in the arena of reappreciating and reevaluating the evidence and material on record and, therefore, the propriety and judicial discipline dissuades this Court from entering into the merits of the case in exercise of powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India as well as under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, since the Apex Court is in seisin of the subject matter to settle the issue authoritatively in its plenary jurisdiction under Chapter IV of the Constitution of India.?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
Thus, it is apparent that the matter has attained finality.	Reasoning
Again, in criminal appeals, we have examined the case on merits as the case relates to Haren Pandya, former Home Minister of Gujarat.	Reasoning
In our opinion on merits in view of the material that has been placed on record including that of Azam Khan?s statement and Book by Rana Ayyub, no case is made out on the basis of material placed on record so as to direct further investigation or reinvestigation.	Reasoning
There is absolutely no material for that purpose.	Reasoning
The matter has already attained finality due to the dismissal of SLP.	Reasoning
Even otherwise the petition has been based upon reports in the newspapers magazines.	Reasoning
It has been observed by this Court in Kusum Lata v. Union of India, (2006) 6 SCC 180 that newspaper reports do not constitute evidence.	Reasoning
This Court also observed that the writ petition should be dismissed with costs so that the message goes in the right direction that a petition filed by the oblique motive does not have the approval of courts.	Reasoning
As we are deciding the criminal appeals along with the order, we have dealt with veracity of prosecution case and fairness of investigation in our opinion the observations made by the High Court were not only uncalled for but based on incorrect appreciation of medical forensic evidence and ignoring material evidence on record.	Reasoning
In Rohit Pandey v. Union of India, (2005) 13 SCC 702 , the writ petition was filed on the basis of newspaper reports by a young lawyer.	None
The petition was filed on 12.2.2004.	None
This Court observed that ordinarily we would have dismissed such a misconceived petition with exemplary costs but considering that the petitioner is a young advocate, costs of Rs.1,000 was imposed.	None
In Holicow Pictures (Pvt.)	None
Ltd. v.	None
Prem Chandra Mishra, (2007) 14 SCC 281 , it was noticed that the petitions are based on newspaper reports without any attempt to verify their authenticity.	None
In Laxmi Raj Shetty v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1988) 3 SCC 319 , this Court has observed that it is well settled that a statement of fact contained in a newspaper is merely hearsay and therefore inadmissible in evidence in absence of the maker of the statement appearing in court and deposing to have perceived the fact reported.	None
In Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lalan?	None
(viii) v. Union of India, (2006) 6 SCC 613 , this Court has observed that public interest litigation cannot be filed for personal gain or political motive or any oblique consideration.	None
Unnecessary reference in the criminal case made against the prosecution case at times may cause serious prejudice to the accused also.	None
In Gulzar Ahmed Azmi v. Union of India, (2012) 10 SCC 731 , it was observed that it is for the affected party to seek redress.	None
Reliance has also been placed on Simranjit Singh Mann v. Union of India Anr., (1992) 4 SCC 653 in which this Court observed Ordinarily, the aggrieved party which is affected by any order has the right to seek redress by questioning the legality, validity or correctness of the order, unless such party is a minor, an insane person or is suffering from any other disability which the law recognises as sufficient to permit another person, e.g. next friend, to move the Court on his behalf.	None
If a guardian or a next friend initiates proceedings for and on behalf of such a disabled aggrieved party, it is in effect proceedings initiated by the party aggrieved and not by a total stranger who has no direct personal stake in the outcome thereof.	None
In the present case no fundamental right of the petitioner before us is violated if at all the case sought to be made out is that the fundamental rights of the two convicts have been violated.	None
The two convicts could, if so minded, have raised the contention in the earlier proceedings but a third party, a total stranger to the trial commenced against the two convicts, cannot be permitted to question the correctness of the conviction recorded against them.	None
If that were permitted any and every person could challenge convictions recorded day in and day out by courts even if the persons convicted do not desire to do so and are inclined to acquiesce in the decision.	None
If the aggrieved party invokes the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, that may stand on a different footing as in the case of A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602.	None
However, we should not be understood to say that in all such cases the aggrieved party has a remedy under Article 32 of the Constitution.	None
Unless an aggrieved party is under some disability recognised by law, it would be unsafe and hazardous to allow any third party to question the decision against him.	None
Take for example a case where a person accused under Section 302, IPC is convicted for a lesser offence under Section 324, IPC.	None
The accused is quite satisfied with the decision but a third party questions it under Article 32 and succeeds.	None
The conviction is set aside and a fresh trial commenced ends up in the conviction of the accused under Section 302, IPC.	None
The person to suffer for the unilateral act of the third party would be the accused Many such situations can be pointed out to emphasise the hazard involved if such third partys unsolicited action is entertained.	None
Cases which have ended in conviction by the apex court after a full gamut of litigation are not comparable with preventive detention cases where a friend or next of kin is permitted to seek a writ of habeas corpus.	None
We are, therefore, satisfied that neither under the provisions of the Code nor under any other statute is a third party stranger permitted to question the correctness of the conviction and sentence imposed by the Court after a regular trial.	None
On first principles, we find it difficult to accept Mr. Sodhis contention that such a public interest litigation commenced by a leader of a recognised political party who has a genuine interest in the future of the convicts should be entertained.	None
In S.P. Gupta v. Union of India, (1981) Supp.	Arguments of Respondent
SCC 87 Bhagwati, J. observed (SCC p. 219, para 24) ?	None
But we must be careful to see that the member of the public, who approaches the court in cases of this kind, is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private profit or political motivation or other oblique consideration.	None
The court must not allow its process to be abused by politicians and others .?	None
These observations were made while discussing the question of locus standi?	None
in public interest litigation.	None
These words of caution were uttered while expanding the scope of the locus standi?	None
rule.	None
These words should deter us from entertaining this petition.	None
This accords with the view expressed by this Court in Krishna Swami v. Union of India, (1992) 4 SCC 605.	None
8.	None
More apposite is the view expressed by a Division Bench of this Court in Janata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary, (1992) 4 SCC 305.	None
That was a public interest litigation for quashing an FIR lodged by the CBI on January 22, 1990 based on the core allegation that certain named and unnamed persons had entered into a criminal conspiracy in pursuance whereof they had secured illegal gratification of crores of rupees from Bofors, a Swiss Company, through their agents as a motive or reward.	None
The CBI had moved an application before the learned Judge, Delhi, for the issuance of a letter rogatory to the Swiss authorities for assistance in conducting an investigation, which request was conceded.	None
An advocate, Shri Harinder Singh Chowdhary, filed a criminal revision application before the High Court of Delhi for quashing the FIR and the letter rogatory on certain grounds.	None
Several questions of law and fact were raised in support of the challenge.	None
The High Court came to the conclusion that the said third party litigant had no locus standi?	None
to maintain the action and so also the interveners had no right to seek impleadment intervention in the said proceeding.	None
However, the learned Judge took suo motu cognizance of the matter and for reasons stated in his order directed issue of show cause notice to the CBI and the State why the FIR should not be quashed.	None
On appeal, this Court came to the conclusion that the learned Judge in the High Court was right in holding that the advocate litigant, as well as the interveners, had no locus standi.	None
The relevant observations found in paragraph 45 of the judgment read as under (SCC p. 329, para 45) ?	None
Even if there are million questions of law to be deeply gone into and examined in a criminal case of this nature registered against specified accused persons, it is for them and them alone to raise all such questions and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at the appropriate time before the proper forum and not for third parties under the garb of public interest litigants.?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
In that case, besides the advocate litigant, certain political parties like the Janata Dal, the CPI (Marxist), the Indian Congress (Socialist) and one Dr. P. Nalla Thampy Thera also approached this Court questioning the High Court?s rejection of their request for impleadment intervention.	None
It was in this context that this Court was required to examine the question whether third parties had any locus standi in criminal proceedings and answered the same as stated above.	None
This decision clearly negatives the submission made by Mr. Sodhi in support of the maintainability of this petition.	None
We are, however, in respectful agreement with the view expressed in the observations extracted hereinbefore.?	None
Reliance has been placed on Ashok Kumar Pandey v. State of W.B., (2004) 3 SCC 349 , in which it has been observed that an aggrieved party which is affected by any order, has the right to seek redress by questioning the legality, validity or correctness of the order, unless aggrieved party is a minor or insane person or is suffering from any other disability, etc. to question the decision again.	None
On behalf of the petitioner, reliance has been placed on A. R. Antulay v. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak Anr., (1984) 2 SCC 500 in which private complaint lodged by Shri R.S. Nayak was held to be maintainable against A.R. Antulay, the then Chief Minister.	Reasoning
It was urged that any person can bring to the notice of the court the fact which constitutes the offence and a Special Judge can take cognizance on such complaint or even on information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge of the fact that the offence has been committed.	Reasoning
The decision has no application in the instant case as Forum of PIL has been misused, we have examined the case and found the same to be meritless.	None
Apart from that, it is not a case where a private complaint has been lodged with respect to an offence.	None
The CBI has investigated the case thoroughly and minutely and the conspiracy between accused persons has been found established.	None
There is voluminous evidence discussed in criminal appeals decided today vide separate judgment with respect to the complicity of the accused persons in the offence.	None
It cannot be said that investigation was unfair, lopsided, botched up or misdirected in any manner whatsoever, as had been observed by the High Court in the judgment which we have set aside.	None
It is surprising that the observations of the High Court have been heavily relied upon in spite of mentioning the fact that the appeal was pending.	None
In all fairness, such petition ought not to have been filed by CPIL at the instance of accused, it is clearly misused of Forum of PIL.	Reasoning
Only an application could have been preferred by the accused persons or by the petitioner or any other interested person in the criminal appeals.	None
Even otherwise, we have not found on merits any material or ground worthy to direct further investigation or reinvestigation in the case.	None
The observations made by the High Court in the judgment which we have set aside were based on lopsided approach without consideration of the entire evidence on record and on the wholly incorrect appreciation of the evidence which was clearly perverse.	None
Reliance has also been placed on Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India Ors., AIR 1984 SC 802 wherein this Court has observed that where a person or class of persons whose fundamental right is violated but who cannot approach the Court on account of poverty or disability or socially or economically disadvantaged position, and in such a case, any member of the public acting bona fide, can move the court for relief under Article 32 and a fortiorari, also under Article 226 so that the fundamental rights may become meaningful not only for the rich and the well to do but also for the large masses of people who are living a life of want and destitution and who are by reason of lack of awareness, assertiveness, and resources unable to seek judicial redress.	None
Court can and must allow any member of the public acting bona fide to espouse the cause of such person or class of persons for judicial enforcement of the fundamental rights.	None
This Court has further observed that the provisions of Article 32 do not specifically indicate who can move the court.	None
In the absence of such a provision in that respect, it is plain that the petitioner may be anyone in whom the law has conferred power to maintain an action of such nature.	None
It is open to anybody who is interested in the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution for relief.	None
The aforesaid proposition cannot be doubted.	None
In the instant case, the petition cannot be said to have been filed bona fide as in the facts and circumstances as narrated above.	None
In case it is at the instance of family members, their rights have been adjudicated by the High Court and concluded up to this Court.	None
Accused persons are represented by able lawyers throughout and in criminal appeals.	None
But unfortunate part is that they had a hand in filing of the petition by supplying the materials to the petitioner CPIL and CPIL in all fairness, ought not to have filed the petition in the form of PIL but an application should have been filed on behalf of the accused persons or any other person interested in criminal appeals.	None
When all concerned were aware that appeal was being heard in this Court for the last 2 months before the filing of the petition, publications being made in reports when the appeal has been taken up for hearing is also not a proper scenario and may tantamount to undue interference in course of justice.	None
We have dealt with on merits the various submissions raised by the petitioner as to the falsity of the case of the prosecution and investigation in criminal appeals and have found that on merits the submissions raised to cast doubt on prosecution case by CPIL are baseless vide detailed discussion which we have made while dealing with the criminal appeals decided today by separate judgment in which we have reiterated the judgment of conviction recorded by the Trial Court.	None
During the course of arguments, we had put a query to Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of CPIL, how he can appear as counsel in the case filed by CPIL as he admittedly is a member of the executive committee of CPIL.	None
In view of the rule of professional ethics framed by the Bar Council of India contained in section I of Chapter II of Part VI, Rule 8 is extracted hereunder An advocate shall not appear in or before any court or tribunal or any other authority for or against an organisation or an institution, society or corporation if he is a member of the Executive Committee of such organisation or institution or society or corporation.	None
Executive Committee, by whatever name it may be called, shall include any Committee or body of persons which, for the time being, is vested with the general management of the affairs of the organisation or institution, society or corporation Provided that this rule shall not apply to such a member appearing as amicus curiae or without a fee on behalf of a Bar Council, Incorporated Law Society or a Bar Association.	None
Rule 8 makes an exception only if such a member is appearing as an amicus curiae or without a fee on behalf of a Bar Council, Incorporated Law Society or a Bar Association.	None
There is no exception to a body like CPIL.	None
Mr. Prashant Bhushan learned counsel has stated that he had questioned the vires of Rule 8 by way of filing a writ petition in the High Court.	None
In order to save vires of aforesaid Rule 8, the statement was made in the Court by the Bar Council that they are going to amend the rules, however, he submitted that the Bar Council has not amended the rules in spite of making the statement.	None
The rule is arbitrary and ultra vires as such he can appear.	None
We are not happy with the entire scenario.	None
There cannot be any justification to appear in violation of Rule 8, on the ground that the rule is arbitrary or ultra vires.	None
The rule is not so far declared to be illegal or ultra vires by the Court.	None
The Rule 8 is binding on the members of the Bar unless and until the rule in question is amended or declared to be arbitrary or ultra vires for any reason, it is to be observed scrupulously by members of the Bar.	None
Rules of professional ethics are meant to be observed by all concerned.	None
In case their observance is done in a breach that too before this Court and that too knowing its implication on the aforesaid canvassed untenable ground, no one can prevent breach of rules of ethics.	None
If the Bar Council after making a statement has not amended the rule, the rule ought to have been questioned afresh in an appropriate petition.	None
The appearance on behalf of the CPIL by a lawyer who is in the Executive Committee of the said Centre, cannot be said to be proper as it is defined misconduct under the rules.	None
This is in breach of Rule 8 of the aforesaid Rules.	None
We need not say any further on this.	None
However, until it is declared ultra vires, we hold that the advocates are bound to observe the same.	None
Resultantly, we find that the petition cannot be said to have been filed bona fide.	Decision
Even otherwise, the petition is bereft of merit.	Decision
It raises the mainly same questions which have been dealt with in the appeal.	Decision
There is no such further material so as to direct further investigation or reinvestigation in the case.	Decision
The matter should have rested finally as the petition filed by the family members also stands dismissed by this Court raking up of the matter, again and again, is not permissible and was wholly unwarranted in the facts and circumstances of the case.	Decision
The same amounts to political vendetta.	None
The petition is thus liable to be dismissed.	None
