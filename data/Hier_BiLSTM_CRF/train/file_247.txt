Assailing the reduction of the compensation, Mr Jayanth Muth Raj, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has contended The High Court has held that income tax returns take precedence over other documents in the determination of annual income.	Arguments of Petitioner
Over 52 documents were marked before the Tribunal demonstrating income from various sources, all of which were not disclosed in the income tax returns (ii) The High Court erred in not considering other contractual work awarded to the deceased and other solvency certificates of the deceased in the computation of his annual income (iii) Even assuming that the High Court is justified in taking the income reflected in the tax return for the financial year 19971998 as the determinant, the High Court has erred in not accounting for the depreciation costs on fixed assets which have been reflected therein and (iv) The High Court ought to have calculated the monthly income of the deceased at Rs 50,000 taking into account the turnover from his trade and wine business.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents contended The High Court is justified in according precedence to the income tax returns of the deceased to determine his annual income There is no merit in the contention that the appellant has suffered a loss on account of the sale of properties for the settling of the debt owed to banks Depreciation on fixed assets cannot be added to the income of the deceased and The award of the High Court is legally sustainable and calls for no interference by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
The rival submissions fall for our consideration.	None
The Tribunal proceeded to determine the agricultural income arising from 36.76 acres of land on the basis of two judgments of the High Court.	None
The Tribunal arrived at two different figures by applying the decisions and proceeded to determine the agricultural income on an average of the two amounts.	None
The Tribunal superimposed a possible value of income from agricultural land despite a clear indication in the income tax returns of the income from agricultural land.	None
The method adopted by the Tribunal is not sustainable in law.	None
On the other hand, the High Court has proceeded on the basis of the income reflected in the income tax returns for the assessment year 19971998.	None
The relevant portion of the return reads Income from House property Rs. 1,920 Business profit (other than 14.b)  	None
Rs.	None
1,21,071 Net Agricultural income Rs. 88,140	None
The tax return indicates an annual income of Rs 2,11,131 in the relevant assessment year.	None
Mr Jayanth Muth Raj, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant contended that other documents were marked which reflected the income of the deceased.	None
We are in agreement with the High Court that the determination must proceed on the basis of the income tax return, where available.	None
The income tax return is a statutory document on which reliance may be placed to determine the annual income of the deceased.	None
To the benefit of the appellants, the High Court has proceeded on the basis of the income tax return for the assessment year 19971998 and not 19992000 and 20002001 which reflected a reduction in the annual income of the deceased.	None
11.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants drew the attention of this Court to the judgment of this Court in New India Assurance Company v Yogesh Devi (2012) 3 SCC 613 to contend that this Court may reasonably determine the income that accrues to the deceased and also compute the expenses incurred in the upkeep of agricultural land.	Arguments of Petitioner
In that case, a two judge Bench of this Court dealt with a claim where there was no evidence regarding the amount of income derived from the abovementioned properties.	None
The only evidence available in regard to the monthly income of the deceased was the statement of the claimant.	None
In the present case, the High Court has relied on the income tax return of the deceased.	None
Further, the Court in New India Assurance opined that though a court may be required to account for the depletion in the net income accruing from the assets of the deceased on account of payments for engaging managers, evidence must be adduced to compute the depletion.	None
The Court held In the normal course the claimants are expected to adduce evidence as to what would be the quantum of depletion in the income from the abovementioned asset on account of the abovementioned factors.	None
In the present case, no evidence was adduced by the appellants at any stage of the proceedings to assist in the computation of the depletion in the net income which accrues to the deceased.	Reasoning
The judgment of this Court in New India Assurance does not help the case of the appellants.	Reasoning
It was then contended by Mr Jayanth Muth Raj that this Court must add to the annual income of the deceased, depreciation costs on capital assets to the amounts of Rs 21,642, 74,685 and 7701 as reflected in the tax return for the assessment year 19971998.	Arguments of Petitioner
We are unable to accede to this contention.	None
Depreciation is the deduction allowed for the decline in the real value of tangible or intangible assets over its useful life.	Reasoning
Its value varies over time and cannot amount to tangible income for the purposes of computing annual income in a claim before the MACT.	None
Mr Jayanth Muth Raj has then drawn our attention to the balance sheet dated 31 March 1997 of Pavai Wines, Sholinghur for the assessment year 1997 1998.	Arguments of Petitioner
An annual amount of Rs 1,04,987 is reflected as payment for a prepaid license fee to the Tamil Nadu Government.	None
In the peculiar circumstances of the case, this amount, having been paid upfront and for a future period is to be added to the annual income of the deceased.	Reasoning
Thus, the net annual income of the deceased is Rs 2,11,131 1,04,987 Rs 3,16,118.	Reasoning
The determination of the amount payable to the appellants is as follows The deceased was selfemployed and aged 49 at the time of the accident.	None
In accordance with the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in National Insurance Company Limited v Pranay Sethi (2017) 16 SCC 680 , 25 of the annual income is to be added for future prospects.	Reasoning

Annual income, accounting for future prospects, is Rs 3,16,118 79,029.5	Reasoning
Rs 3,95,147.5	None
and In accordance with paragraph 30 of the decision of this Court in Sarla Verma v Delhi Transport Corporation (2009) 6 SCC 121 , the deduction for personal expenses for a married person where the dependents are between four to six people is 1/5 th or 20. 20 of Rs 3,95,147.5 79,029.5.	Reasoning
Net annual income is Rs 3,95,147.5  79,029.5	Reasoning
Rs 3,16,118.	None
In accordance with the judgment of this Court in Sarla Verma, the multiplier to be applied when the deceased is between the age group 46 to 50 is 13.	Reasoning
The loss of dependency is calculated at Rs 3,16,118 X 13 Rs 41,09,534.	Reasoning
In accordance with the judgment of this Court in Pranay Sethi, Rs 15,000, 15,000 and 40,000 must be added for funeral expenses, loss of estate and loss of consortium respectively.	Reasoning
