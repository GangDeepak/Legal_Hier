The simple yet important question of law that have arisen in these appeals before us and which have serious ramifications on the maintenance of sanctity in our democracy is as to whether the Election Commission, under Section 10A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, can conduct an enquiry to determine the falsity of the return of election expenses by an elected candidate, especially after a decision is rendered by the High Court in the Election Petition preferred by the Respondent No. 1.3.	Issue
On the aforesaid background, let us briefly examine the facts of this case.	Facts
The appeal ( SLP(C) No. 29882 of 2011) has been filed by the candidate who was elected in the Assembly elections in the State of Maharashtra.	Facts
The results of the election to the Assembly were declared on 22.10.2009.	Facts
The Respondent No. 1 was one of the candidates who contested the said election as against the Appellant.	Facts
The Appellant was declared elected and the Respondent No. 1 was an unsuccessful candidate.	Facts
As per the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 (hereinafter called the Act and the Rules), within one month from the date of publication of the results, a statement of election expenses has to be filed by the candidate with the District Election Officer (hereinafter called DEO).	Facts
The Appellant stated to have filed his statement of election expenses on 17.11.2009, i.e., within one month of the date of election.	Facts
It is also brought to our notice that on 24.11.2009, the DEO, Nanded forwarded his report to the Election Commission of India and that according to the Appellant, nothing adverse was stated in the said report.	Facts
However, on 02.12.2009, the Respondent No. 1 filed a complaint with the Election Commission alleging violation of the Election Code based on newspaper reports.	Facts
Besides the above complaint of the Respondent No. 1 to the Election Commission, he also filed an Election Petition before the Election Tribunal (High Court) on 04.12.2009.	Facts
This very allegation which was raised before the Election Commission was stated to have been raised in the Election Petition as well.	Facts

No. 2 of 2013.	None
Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel in the first instance, referred to Sections 77(1)(2)(3), 80A, 86 (1), 100(1)(a) (b) and 123(6), as well as Section 10A of the said Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel also referred to Articles 101(3)(a), 102(1)(e) and 103 of the Constitution, as well as Articles 190, 191(1)(e) and 192.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel also made reference to Rules 86, 87, 88 and 89 falling under Part VIII of the Rules and contended that the Election Commission had no jurisdiction to deal with the issue relating to disqualification on the ground of irregularity in the lodging of election expenses in the present case, by virtue of the fact that the said issue can only be dealt with in an Election Petition before the Election Tribunal (High Court).	Arguments of Petitioner
According to learned Senior Counsel, in the case on hand, since at the instance of Respondent No. 1, the successful election of the Appellant was the subject matter of challenge in an Election Petition, which was dismissed by the Election Tribunal (High Court) for want of material particulars and upheld by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 9271 of 2012, there is total lack of jurisdiction for the Election Commission to deal with said issue all over again.6.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel also brought to our notice the old Section 7(c) of the 1950 Act, which was a provision for disqualification prior to the 1966 amendment by which Section 10A was introduced and also referred to the earlier judgment of this Court reported in Sucheta Kripalani v. S.S. Dulat Ors., AIR 1955 SC 758 , as well as the subsequent decision reported in L.R. Shivaramagowda Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
v. T.M. Chandrashekar (D)	Arguments of Petitioner
by LRs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ors., 1999(1) SCC 666.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel then contended that when the Election Petition, as preferred under Section 86 of the Act was dismissed for want of material particulars, which is a binding judgment, having regard to the principles laid down in the decisions of this Court reported in Dipak Chandra Ruhidas v. Chandan Kumar Sarkar, 2003(7) SCC 66 and Azhar Hussain v. Rajiv Gandhi, 1986 (Supp) SCC 315, such contentions are to be pleaded supported by proper material facts and when once such plea was dealt with by the Election Tribunal (High Court) and rejected, which was also upheld by this Court, there is no residuary jurisdiction left with the Election Commission to pass another order of disqualification.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel contended that though the Election Petition was dismissed for want of material particulars, still it is a final judgment and that the same is binding on all concerned.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel after referring to Section 10A visavis the old Section 7(c) of the Act, contended that failure to lodge the account in the manner required is an exercise to be examined in a summary manner and there is no scope for an adjudication as sought to be made by the Election Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel also contended that for the first time since the amendment in 1966, the Election Commission seeks to examine the correctness of the details in an elaborate manner, which is not permissible.7.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned Senior Counsel, while Section 78 of the Act may be referable to Section 10A, Section 77 cannot be read into Section 10A. After making reference to Sections 77, 100, 123(6) as well as Sections 44, 76, 99 and 100 of the Act learned Senior Counsel contended that while under the old law, a false return was a corrupt practice which can earn a disqualification, in the light of the amendment now made, the Election Commission cannot confer upon itself a jurisdiction, even after an adjudication in an election petition, by seeking to exercise its powers under Section 10A.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel by referring to the earlier decision of this Court in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) contended that the ratio laid down therein that the Election Commission can only see the form and not substance, continue to hold good even as on date.8.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned Senior Counsel, after the amendment to Section 7(c) and introduction of Section 10A, the automatic disqualification has been taken away and the power is now vested with the Election Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was, however, contended that the present attempt of the Election Commission to hold an adjudication of the issue, if accepted, would result in collision with the judicial forum, which has already exercised its powers in an Election Petition.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to learned Senior Counsel, the law declared in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) which held the field prior to the various amendments introduced viz to Sections 7, 8, 8A, 10, 10A, 11, 77, 85, 101(b) and 126, continue to hold good.9.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel also finally brought to our notice the amended Rule 89 after the 1966 amendment in which subrule (5) was introduced.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Rule empowers the Election Commission to take a decision in the event of the contesting candidates failing to lodge their account of election expenses within the time and in the manner required by the Act, as well as the Rules by which the Election Commission can call upon the candidate concerned to show cause why he should not be disqualified under Section 10A for his failure.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel then referred to the order impugned in the appeal ( SLP(C) No. 29882 of 2011) passed by the Election Commission holding that the Election Commission is fully empowered to pass an order of disqualification for the failure of the elected candidate to lodge the account as per the Act and the Rules.10.	Arguments of Petitioner
The sum and substance of the submission of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel is  By virtue of Article 329 (b) of the Constitution read with Section 80 of the Act, a challenge to the election can only be by way of an election petition, that the election of the Appellant having been challenged unsuccessfully, in an election petition which was also confirmed by this Court in C.A. 9271/2012 by order dater 21.1.2013, there is no power or jurisdiction with the Election Commissioner to enquire into the validity of the said election or for that matter pass an order of disqualification by way of holding an enquiry under Section 10A of the Act.(b)	Arguments of Petitioner
Even after the amendments to the Act in 1956, as well as in 1966, in the end by which Section 7(c) came to be amended and, thereafter, replaced by Section 10A, whatever ratio laid down by this Court in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) continued to hold good and that the judgment in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) was clearly distinguishable and required reconsideration.	Arguments of Petitioner
The submission is that as per Section 7(c) of the Act, prior to its amendment, what was held by this Court in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) was that the submission of return of election expenses is only in form and not in substance and that the said principle continues to apply even in relation to Section 10A of the Act.(c)	Arguments of Petitioner
The enquiry contemplated by the Election Commission if permitted to be held, would result in conducting a trial which would be ultra vires of Article 329 (b), that there is no statutory rule or procedure for holding such an enquiry, which would otherwise involve the applicability of rules of pleading, powers of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1905 question of limitation, adding of proper parties, applicability of the Evidence Act, 1872 and the like.	Arguments of Petitioner
When such a procedure is not being provided as contemplated in the Act, the attempt of the Election Commission to proceed with the inquiry would result in anomalous consequences, and, therefore, the impugned order of the Election Commission cannot be sustained.(d) Section 10A disqualification is only a default disqualification and not a stigmatized one and any enquiry under Section 10A can only be based on the DEOs report.	Arguments of Petitioner
Also reasons are to be given only when removal or reduction of disqualification is to be made under Section 11, and, therefore, if the Election Commission were to ultimately set aside an election by exercising its power under Section 10A, the consequences would be very severe.(e)	Arguments of Petitioner
The Election Commission, who was impleaded as a party in the election petition itself sought for its deletion, that the Complainants Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi or Kirit Somaiya, neither being voters nor candidates who lost in the election, had no locus standi to seek for an enquiry under Section 10A, inasmuch as an election petition can only be as against an elected candidate.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the scope of holding any enquiry by the Election Commission can be referable only to Article 191(1)(e) read with Article 192(2) of the Constitution and not otherwise by invoking Section 10A of the said Act.(f)	Arguments of Petitioner
The scope of invalidating an election is available under Section 100(1)(d)(iv) of the said Act which would cover all illegality.(g) Law of the election being a special law, its intendment as well as effects will have to be found in the given law and not outside of it.	Arguments of Petitioner
The doctrine of equitable consideration will not apply and where the Constitution leaves any ambiguity, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the subject as against the legislature.(h)	Arguments of Petitioner
The power of Election Commission under Article 324 of the Constitution can be invoked only where it is unoccupied and when there is no vacuum in the Act, the Election Commission cannot enlarge its powers wider than what is available to the Election Tribunal (High Court).(i)	Arguments of Petitioner
The impugned order of the Election Commission in attempting to enlarge its powers while invoking Section 10A cannot be permitted.(j)	Arguments of Petitioner
The Election Commission failed to note that the requirement under the Rule is for the election officer, as well as the Election Commission, to only see that the returns were filed in time as prescribed under the Act and if there is no good reason for failure to lodge the accounts within time, the Election Commission can only examine the reason for passing appropriate orders under Section 11 and not beyond.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of the above submissions, the learned Senior Counsel relied upon N.P. Ponnuswami v. The Returning Officer, Namakkal Consti tuency, Namakkal, Salem Dist., Ors., AIR 1952 SC 64 , State of H.P. Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner

Mr. Venkataramani, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant in the appeal ( SLP (C) No. 14209 of 2012 adopted the submission of Mr. Gopal Subramanium.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Union of India was represented by Mr. L. Nageswar Rao, learned Additional Solicitor General.	Arguments of Respondent
At the very outset, he submitted that though the Union of India is now taking a contrary stand than what was taken before the Election Commission, as the issue relates to the interpretation of Section 10A, which is purely a legal question, in the light of the judgment of this Court in P. Nallammal Anr.	Arguments of Respondent
v. State Rep. by Inspector of Police, 1999(3) R.C.R.(Criminal)	Arguments of Respondent
676 (1999)6 SCC 559 such a stand of the Union of India cannot be faulted.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Additional Solicitor General contended that Section 10A only covers some procedural aspects and not substantive aspects.	Arguments of Respondent
After referring to Section 10A and the expressions used in the said Section, namely, manner the learned Additional Solicitor General contended that the said expression has to be interpreted only as a mode or a procedure and not a substance of correctness of the return to be filed.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Additional Solicitor General after referring to the dictionary meaning of the expression manner, relied on a decision of this Court reported in Sales Tax Officer v. K.I. Abraham, 1967(3)	Arguments of Respondent
SCR 518 wherein, this Court held that the expression manner only refers to the mode and not substance.	Arguments of Respondent
His contention was that since the provision is penal in nature, it calls for strict interpretation.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Additional Solicitor General, therefore, contended that when such an interpretation is made to Section 10A, the failure to submit the accounts in time is for the satisfaction of the Election Commission, which is merely about the form and not of substance.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Additional Solicitor General further submitted that the scope of enquiry under Section 10A is not adjudicatory in nature and that no reasons are needed to be recorded.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, what is to be seen is that the filing and such filing is in the proper form.	Arguments of Respondent
The Learned Additional Solicitor General relied upon the decision reported in Tolaram Relumal Anr.	Arguments of Respondent
v. The State of Bombay, 1955(1)	Arguments of Respondent

While referring to L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra), the learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the interpretation placed in paragraph 18 is not in consonance with Section 123 (6) visvis Section 77, read along with Rules 86 and 89 and, therefore, it requires reconsideration.13.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondent No. 1, after narrating the sequence of events from the date the election result was declared, announcing the success of the Appellant on 22.10.2009 and thereafter, the filing of the complaint under Section 10A before the Election Commission on 02.12.2009, referred to the various dates of hearings when the Election Commission heard the parties, including the Appellant and the impugned order dated 02.04.2011 passed by the Election Commission, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court in W.P. No. 2511 of 2011 by order dated 30.09.2011.	Arguments of Respondent
In his submissions, he raised the following contentions  	None
A reading of Section 10A along with Section 77(1) and (2), 78 as well as Rules 86 to 89 would show that it is only the Election Commission which can, on being satisfied about the failure to lodge a correct account of all election expenditure in the manner required by or under the Act, disqualify a candidate for the period specified in the said provision.(b) That Section 10A is independent of Article 329(b) of the Constitution and, therefore, there is no scope to hold that the said provision is ultra vires .(c)	Arguments of Respondent
By virtue of Rule 89 read along with Section 10A, it cannot be held that only at the instance of DEO the Election Commission can exercise its powers under Section 10A.	Arguments of Respondent
On the other hand, the satisfaction which could be arrived at by the Election Commission under Section 10A may be based on a report of the DEO or after hearing the parties or upon an enquiry by the Election Commission as per Rule 89, which uses the expression as it thinks fit.(d)	Arguments of Respondent
The present allegation against the Appellant is paid news and advertisements, which were not accounted for and which having not been disclosed by the Appellant in the return, have now come to light through the Press Council and other sources.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, it could not have been within the knowledge of the DEO in order to state that it is only at the instance of the DEO that the Election Commission can hold any enquiry under Section 10A of the Act.(e)	Arguments of Respondent
The scope of jurisdiction of the Election Tribunal in considering the validity of the Election of a member is different from the power of disqualification that can be passed by the Election Commission under Section 10A and, therefore, the dismissal of the Election Petition for want of particulars cannot be a ground to thwart the exercise of the power and jurisdiction of the Election Commission to pass orders under Section 10A.(f)	Arguments of Respondent
The case on hand is covered by the decision of this Court reported in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) inasmuch as this Court has already held that the Commission alone has the power to determine whether the election account filed by a returned candidate is true and correct for the purpose of Section 10A of the Act.(g)	Arguments of Respondent
The decision in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) is no longer good law inasmuch as the substratum of the said judgment having been erased by the subsequent amendments to the Act once in 1956 and again in 1966 by which the whole scheme of the Act had undergone a drastic change by which the scope of jurisdiction of the Election Tribunal, as well as the power and jurisdiction of the Election Commission has been distinctly spelt out.	Arguments of Respondent
It is, therefore, contended that since the old Section 7(c), which provided for a disqualification without reference to the satisfaction of the Election Commission, having been replaced by Section 10A which specifically uses the expression the satisfaction of the Election Commission of India and also by using the expression about the lodging of the return, in the manner as prescribed by or under the Act and within the time, were all expressions which demonstrate that the power of the Election Commission under Section 10A was wide enough to hold an enquiry to find out the truthfulness and correctness of the expenditure incurred by the Appellant in order to pass appropriate order of disqualification.15.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel, therefore, contended that the order of the Election Commission dated 02.04.2011, as well as that of the High Court of Delhi dated 30.09.2011, do not call for interference.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Sunil Kumar learned Senior Counsel who appeared for the Appellant in appeal ( SLP(C) No. 21958 of 2013), supported the submission of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel and also contended that Section 10A does not empower the Election Commission to take oath, nor assume the powers of a quasi judicial authority and, therefore, the Election Commission cannot exercise a jurisdiction to the extent of passing the order of disqualification.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned Senior Counsel, the Act and the Rules make a clear distinction as between lodgment and maintenance of accounts.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, while lodgment is mere form, maintenance of accounts is one of substance.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel submitted that Section 78 along with Rules 86 (3) and 89, only talk of lodgment of account and not correctness of the account.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned Senior Counsel, after a reading of paragraph 22 of the L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) judgment, it can only be said that failure of lodgment is a matter of form and the correctness or otherwise of lodgment of accounts was not spelt out.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel further contended that Section 77 only talks of maintenance of accounts.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is a matter of substance which will attract Section 123 (6) in which event the issue would be outside the jurisdiction of the Election Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel relied upon certain decisions of this Court in Somnath Sahu v. The State of Orissa Ors., 1969 (3) SCC 384 and Common Cause (A Registered Society) v. Union of India Ors., 1996(3) R.C.R.(Civil) 3 (1996)2 SCC 752 in support of his submissions.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel apart from arguing about the scope of jurisdiction of the Election Commission under Section 10A of the Act also challenged the order of the Election Commission dated 20.10.2011, disqualifying the Appellant for a period of three years on merits which order was also confirmed by the Division Bench in the impugned order in this appeal.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sunil Kumar, while attacking orders impugned in this contended that the expenses incurred by the party cannot be held to be expenses incurred by the Appellant and, therefore, conclusion of the Election Commission, in having held that the Appellant did not file the return of expenses in manner and as prescribed by or under the Act, has liable to be set aside.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ms. Pinki Anand, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 in her submissions stated that the said Respondents had not filed any election petition, therefore, the submission that the election petition has already been dismissed for want of particulars, will not apply to them.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel after referring to the complaint, the reply filed by the Appellant and the form in which the Appellant filed the accounts as well as the supplement letter of the DEO dated 01.12.2009, submitted that after deletion of Section 143, the decision in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) could longer survive.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel contended that having regard to Rules 89 (4) and 86 (e) and (f), it is a mandatory requirement for a candidate to file a true and correct account and if the account is incorrect, Rule 89 (4) will get attracted.	Arguments of Respondent
Consequently, the power of the Election Commission while holding an enquiry under Section 10A fully empowers the Election Commission to examine the correctness of the accounts as prescribed under the Act, namely, Sections 77 and 78 and therefore, has the jurisdiction to hold an enquiry and pass the order of disqualification.18.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel who appeared for the intervenor in I.A. No. 2 of 2013, submitted that after the introduction of Section 10A by the 1966 amendment and a reference to Section 77 and 123 (6), it can no longer be contended that even by submitting a nil return, the obligation under Section 77 read with Section 123 (6) is complied with.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel contended that the Election Commission had the power and duty to disqualify and the reliance placed upon Sucheta Kripalani (supra) cannot be permitted in the light of the subsequent change made in the provisions of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Counsel, therefore, contended that the Election Commission has got every jurisdiction to hold an enquiry and pass appropriate orders of disqualification and the remedy has also been provided for under Section 11 for the Election Commission to pass appropriate orders for stated reasons to reverse the order of disqualification.19.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Ashok Desai, learned Senior Counsel who appeared for the Election Commission, prefaced his submission by stating that free and fair election is the basic feature of our democracy, which again is the basic structure of the Constitution, that under Article 324 of the Constitution, the Election Commission is not only invested with plenary powers but has got a constitutional obligation to organize a free and fair election and that under Section 10A, the power of the Election Commission is much wider when it comes to the question of disqualification in contrast to an election petition, where the validity of an election can be challenged.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel referred to the nature of allegations levelled against the Appellants in the above appeals, namely, Mr. Ashok Shankarrao Chavan, Ms. Madhu Kora and Mr. Umlesh Yadav, wherein the complaint disclosed the enormous unaccounted expenses incurred by them.	Arguments of Respondent
This was brought to the notice of the Election Commission by the contestants in the case of Mr. Ashok Shankarrao Chavan, by the Central Board of Direct Taxes in the case of Mr. Madhu Kora and by the Press Council in the case of Mr. Umlesh Yadav.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel also submitted that in all the above cases, notice was duly issued to the Appellants calling for their remarks.	Arguments of Respondent
The submission of the learned Senior Counsel can be concretized as under  The learned Senior Counsel by making a comparative reading of Section 123(6) visavis Section 10A, submitted that while under Section 123(6), only a candidate who contested the election can file a complaint, under Section 10A any person including an elector can make the complaint.(b)	Arguments of Respondent
It was then pointed out that while for preferring a complaint under Section 123(6) a period of limitation of 45 days from the date of the election is prescribed as per Section 81, there is no prescribed time limit for invoking Section 10A and that what is expected is only a complaint to be filed within a reasonable time.(c)	Arguments of Respondent
Lastly under Section 123(6), a party who is concerned with the allegation may be an aggrieved party who can provide the source, while under Section 10A a citizen who is keen on purity of election can prefer a complaint.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also pointed out that while an election petition would be decided by Election Tribunal (High Court) namely, the High Court, the disqualification under Section 10A can be decided by an Election Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Desai, learned Senior Counsel after referring to the provisions of the Act, as it originally stood prior to its amendments of 1956 and 1966, also referred to the decisions in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) and L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra).	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra), after the introduction of Section 10A the scope and jurisdiction of Election Commission has been firmly stated and that that position alone should prevail.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel submitted that having regard to the wide powers invested with the Election Commission under Section 10A, which has been rightly recognized and approved by this Court in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra), there is no scope for the Appellant to contend that the Election Commission lacked jurisdiction.	Arguments of Respondent
Having dealt with the rival contentions of the parties, it would be necessary to find out whether the impugned order of the Election Commission is correct or not.	None
For this, the various provisions of the Constitution as well as the relevant provisions as they originally existed prior to 1956 and 1966, the amendments made to the Act and the provisions which are existing as on date are required to be noted.	None
In fact, the various provisions under the Act both prior to the 1956 and 1966 amendments and the provisions which are existing as on date, were adverted to by the learned counsel appearing for their respective parties, as there is a need to find out the implication of those provisions.	None
The purpose is to find out an answer to the question posed for consideration, namely, whether under Section 10A of the Act, the Election Commission has been empowered to hold an enquiry to ascertain the correctness or otherwise of the election expenses incurred by a returned candidate for the purpose of passing the order of disqualification, either at the instance of the candidate who also contested in the said election or by any other person or based on any other information received by the Election Commission through some reliable sources.

None
Having noted the various Articles of the Constitution as well as the provisions of the Act, it will be worthwhile to understand the whole scheme of the above articles and provisions before making any attempt to find out the scope and ambit of Section 10A of the Act.	None
Article 101(3)(a) will have to be read along with Article 102(1)(e).	None
Article 101(3)(a) merely states about the consequences that would follow if a Member of either House of Parliament suffers disqualification as provided under Article 102(1)(e), namely, that the seat would thereupon become vacant in the Parliament.	None
The purport of Article 102(1)(e) is to ensure that any disqualification of a Member of Parliament can be declared only by or under any law made by the Parliament.	None
That apart under Article 103 of the Constitution, whenever a question arises as to whether a Member of Parliament has been disqualified as provided under Article 102(1), the decision as to such a disqualification can be reached only by the President of India, which would become absolute and conclusive.	None
However, under Article 103(2) it is provided that before arriving at such a decision, the President should obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and act based upon such opinion of the Election Commission.	None
Articles 190(3)(a), 191(1)(e) and 192(1)(2) are the identical provisions, which would be applicable to a Member of a Legislature of the State.	None
The only difference is under Article 192, it will be the Governor who can take the decision and such a decision should be again based on the opinion rendered by the Election Commission.	None
Therefore, Articles 101, 102, 103, 190, 191 and 192 prescribe and mention as to how a disqualification of a Member of a Parliament or a Member of a State Legislature can be given effect to either by the President of India or by the Governor of the respective States by declaring the consequent vacancy created either in the Parliament or the State Legislature.	None
Under Article 102 (1) (e) and 191(1)(e), it is stipulated that such a disqualification shall have to be initially arrived at by applying the provisions of law made by the Parliament.	None
Therefore, the common thread in the above Constitutional provisions relatable to a Member of a Parliament or a Member of a State Legislature is that apart from other disqualifications mentioned in Articles 102(1)(a) to (d) and 191(1)(a) to (d), a disqualification arrived at as provided under a law made by the Parliament would form the basis for either the President of India or for the Governor of the respective States to ultimately take a decision as regards such disqualification declared under a valid law made by the Parliament.	None
Apart from the above provisions, under Article 329(b), it is specified that an Election to either House of Parliament or either House of the Legislature of a State, cannot be called in question except by an Election Petition presented to such authority in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate legislature.	None
While Articles 101 to 103 and 191 to 192 deals with the disqualification of an elected member either to the Parliament or to the State Legislature, Article 329(b) relates to the validity of a member elected to any constituency in an election held in accordance with law and such validity can be examined only by a prescribed authority under the law made by the appropriate legislature.	None
Reading Article 329(b) and Sections 80 to 116 of the Act together, the position emerges that the status of a validly elected candidate in an election can be called in question only before the Election Tribunal (High Court) by way of an Election Petition and such Election Petition to be decided by the Election Tribunal (High Court) in the manner prescribed under the above referred to provisions by following the procedures laid down therein.	None
It further emerges that the validity of an election to either of the House of Parliament or the State Legislature cannot be called in question in any other manner other than what has been prescribed under the provisions of the Act, as has been set out in Sections 80 to 116 of the Act.	None
Apart from the above Constitutional mandates, relating to disqualification and validity of an election to be challenged, under Articles 327 and 328 of the Constitution, provides the power to Parliament to make provisions by law to deal with the elections to Parliament and State Legislature and also by the State if such law does not contain any provision to deal with an election to the said offices.	None
Apparently, in the purported exercise of the above Article 327 of the Constitution, the Representation of the People Act in the year 1950 and subsequently in the year 1951, came to be passed in the Parliament and thereafter, the relevant rules, namely, the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 were also promulgated.	None
Under Article 324(1) of the Constitution in Part XV, the nature of functions, powers such as superintendence, issuance of directions, control of the preparation of the electoral rolls, the conduct of all elections to Parliament and to the legislature of every State, as well as the elections to the offices of the President and VicePresident, as per the Constitution, is invested with the Election Commission.	None
When we discuss about the powers of the Election Commission, a detailed reference to Article 324(1) can be made to Section 10A of the said Act in the matter of disqualification of a Member of Parliament or State Legislature.	None
Apart from the above Constitutional provisions, we also refer to some of the provisions which were existing prior to the 1956 and 1966 Amendments to the Act.	None
One relevant provision which has to be noted in the context of the present Section 10A of the Act is Section 7(c) as it existed prior to the amendment.	None
Prior to the introduction of Section 10A, Section 7(c) prescribed as to how a person should be disqualified for being chosen as and for being a Member of either House of the Parliament or of a Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of a State.	None
It was stipulated that if a person having been nominated as a candidate for Parliament or the Legislature of a State fails to lodge a return of election expenses within time and in the manner required by or under the Act, would suffer such disqualification unless five years have elapsed from the date by which the return ought to have been lodged or the Election Commission removed such disqualification.	None
Section 8(c), which was a nonobstante clause, specified that a disqualification suffered under Clause (c) of Section 7, cannot take effect unless the expiration of two months from the date by which return of the election expenses ought to have been lodged or such longer period as the Election Commission may in any particular case allow.	None
A reading of Sections 7(c) and 8(b) as it existed then, vested no specific authority with the Election Commission or for that matter with any other authority as to how a disqualification can be declared for the failure to lodge a return of the election expenses within the time and in the manner required by or under the Act.	None
In fact, the subsequent amendment to Section 7(c) only related to the expiration of a period of five years having been altered as three years and in Section 8(c)	None
it is stated that the expiration of two months period would start from the date on which the Election Commission decided that the account of election expenses has not been lodged within the time and in the manner required by or under this Act.	None
Therefore, a conspicuous reading of Sections 7(c) and 8(b), as it originally existed, and after its amendment under Act 27 of 1956, remained the same and the only improvement made was that the decision as regards the failure to lodge the account within the stipulated time limit is to be declared by the Election Commission for Section 7(c) to operate.	None
The above prescription which existed prior to introduction of Section 10A has to be necessarily noted in order to appreciate what is the effect that had been brought about by virtue of the introduction of Section 10A to the Act.	None
Before adverting to the scope of Section 10A, it is necessary to note certain other provisions, namely, Sections 77, 78, 123(6) as well as Rules 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 of the Rules, since, the implication of the above provisions and Rules would arise while examining the effect of Section 10A after its introduction.	None
Section 77 which is under Chapter VIII mandates as to how the account of election expenses are to be maintained and the maximum limit that can be expended as prescribed.	None
When we read Section 77(1), it is specified therein that every candidate should keep a separate and correct account of all the expenditure in connection with the election that was incurred as between the date on which his nomination was made and the date of declaration of the result thereof i.e. inclusive of both the dates.	Arguments of Respondent
A careful reading of Section 77(1) makes it significantly clear that a candidate contesting in an election, should maintain a separate and correct account of all expenditure incurred by him in connection with the election.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 73(3) makes it mandatory that the total of the expenditure in connection with an election should not exceed such amount as may be prescribed.	None
Here and now we can point out that under Rule 90 of the Rules, the total of the expenditure that can be expended for which account is to be maintained under Section 77 has been prescribed in a separate table applicable to different States, in respect of their Parliamentary Constituency and Assembly Constituency.	None
Therefore, reading Section 77(3) along with Rule 90 and Section 77(1), what ultimately emerges is that every candidate contesting in an election should maintain a separate account relating to the election, that such account should contain all the expenditures incurred by him in connection with the election and most importantly such details of the account and the expenses incurred must reflect the correct particulars apart from ensuring that such expenditure does not exceed the maximum limit prescribed under Rule 90 as stipulated under Section 77(3).	Arguments of Respondent
The next step is lodging of such an account which was maintained as stipulated under Section 77 read with Rule 90.	None
Section 78 of the Act mandates that every contesting candidate in an election should within 30 days from the date of election of the returned candidate, lodge with the DEO an account of his election expenses, which should be a true copy of the account kept by him or by his election agent as required under Section 77.	Facts
The corresponding rules are Rules 87, 88 and 89 of the Rules.	None
Under Rule 87, within two days from the date on which the account of election expenses is lodged by candidate, as stipulated under Section 78, the DEO should cause a notice to be affixed in the notice board, specifying the date on which the account was lodged, the name of the candidate and the time and place at which such account could be inspected.	None
Under Rule 88 any person would be entitled on payment of a fee of ?1 to inspect any such account and on payment of such fee that may be fixed by the Election Commission, obtain attested copies of such account or any part thereof.	None
Reading Section 78 and Rules 87 and 88, the intention of the legislature has been explicitly made clear that the maintenance of the correct account of the election expenses within the time limit prescribed in making such expenses is not for the satisfaction of the Election Commission alone.	None
The purport and intent of the said exercise is to ensure that none of the candidates can take it as a formality and file some return without disclosing their correct particulars, inasmuch as once the true copy of the account maintained is lodged with the DEO it is not only for the candidates who contested in the election but any person meaning thereby, any citizen of this country can have access to verify the account lodged with the DEO and also get a authenticated copy of such a statement.	None
In fact, such a stipulation contained in Sections 77(1) and (3), 78, Rule 90, as well as Rules 87 and 88 were brought into the statute book in order to ensure that the purity in the election is maintained at any cost and nobody is allowed to take the voting public of this country for a ride.	None
It will also be appropriate to state and we can even take judicial notice of the fact about every kind of manipulations and malpractices that are being adopted and applied in elections in the recent past as is reported widely in the Press and Media.	None
Unlike the yester years, i.e. immediately after independence and the role of Election Commission while holding the public elections has become so vital, a greater and wider responsibility is imposed on the Election Commission to ensure that those who contest the elections maintain high amount of integrity and honesty and that the voting public are not duped by their evil designs.	None
With that when we come to Rule 89, the said rule contains subrules (1) to (8), which specify to the extent to which the verification of the correctness and genuineness of the accounts lodged can be enquired.	None
Under subrule (1) of Rule 89, after lodging of the true copy of the account as specified under Section 78 of the Act, the DEO should report to the Election Commission as to the name of each contesting candidate and state whether such candidate lodged his account of election expenses and if so the date on which such account was lodged and whether the account was lodged within the required time and in the manner required by the Act and the Rules.	None
When we refer to the said stipulation, namely, the manner required under the Act, it will have to be stated that the manner required would certainly include the true and correct accounts to be maintained, a copy of which alone can be stated to mean having been lodged in the manner required.	None
In fact, under sub rule (2) of Rule 89, the DEO if on verification found that the lodging of the account was not in the manner required, should send a report to that effect to the Election Commission along with the accounts lodged by the candidate concerned.	None
The DEO should also publish a copy of his report in the notice board.	None
Under subrule (4) of Rule 89, after the receipt of the report referred to in subrule (1), the Election Commission has to again consider the same and decide whether any contesting candidate failed to lodge the account of election expenses within the time and in the manner required by or under the Act and the Rules.	None
Under subrule (5) of Rule 89 when the Election Commission decides that a contesting candidate failed to lodge his account of election expenses within time and in the manner required by the Act as well as the Rules, it should by notice in writing call upon the candidate to show cause why he should not be disqualified under Section 10A for such default.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under subrule (6) of Rule 89, once the notice to show cause is issued as per sub rule (5), within 20 days of receipt of such notice, the candidate concerned should submit a representation in writing to the Election Commission and simultaneously forward a copy to the DEO together with the complete account of his election expenses, if he had not already furnished such an account.	Reasoning
Under subrule (7) of Rule 89, the DEO should forward his report on the representation so submitted by the candidate, if any, with such comments which he wishes to make on the said representation.	None
Under subrule (8) of Rule 89, the Election Commission after such enquiry, as he thinks fit, on being satisfied that no good reason or justification was shown for the failure to lodge the account, can pass an order of disqualification as provided under Section 10A for a period of three years from the date of the order and publish such order in the official gazette.	None
We find in subrules (1) to (5), specific reference to the manner required by the Act as regards the account to be maintained, a true copy of which is to be lodged with the DEO which is to be ultimately forwarded to the Election Commission.	None
When we examine subrule (8) of Rule 89, the said Rule makes it clear that the Election Commission is empowered to hold such enquiry as it thinks fit before passing any orders under Section 10A of the Act.	None
The said exercise has to be carried out by the Election Commission after the issuance of the show cause notice and after the receipt of representation by the candidate read along with the comments of the DEO.	None
When the Election Commission has been invested with the powers to hold an enquiry, it will have to be stated that such an enquiry is not an empty formality, but having regard to the requirement of law as stipulated under Section 77(1) and (3) and 78 of the Act, it should be a comprehensive enquiry, wherein the Election Commission can ascertain whether the accounts lodged in the purported exercise of Section 78 by a contesting candidate reflects a true, correct and genuine account and not a bogus one.	None
In fact, the purpose of holding an enquiry is not only to ensure that the ascertainment of the correctness or otherwise of the account lodged, as well as, the time within which such lodgment was made, but also ensure that such account is a true and correct account of the actual expenses incurred for the election inasmuch as the Act as well as the Rule makes it clear that such furnishing of the account is in the manner required under the Act.	None
In our considered opinion if such a onerous responsibility has been imposed on the Election Commission while scrutinizing the details of the accounts of the election expenses submitted by a contesting candidate, it will have to be stated that while discharging the said responsibility, every care should be taken to ensure that no prejudice is caused to the contesting candidate.	Reasoning
The Election Commission should also ensure that no stone is left unturned before reaching a satisfaction as to the correctness or the proper manner in which the lodgment of the account was carried out by the concerned candidate.	Reasoning
If such a meticulous exercise has to be made as required under the law, it will have to be held that the onerous responsibility imposed on the Election Commission should necessarily contain every power and authority in him to hold an appropriate enquiry.	Reasoning
Only such an exercise would ensure that in ultimately arriving at the satisfaction for the purpose of examining whether an order of disqualification should be passed or not as stipulated under Section 10A, the high expectation of the electorate, that is the citizens of the country reposed in the Election Commission is fully ensured and also no prejudice is caused to the contesting candidate by casually passing any order of disqualification without making proper ascertainment of the details of the accounts, the correctness of the accounts and the time within which such account was lodged by the candidate concerned.	Reasoning
When we examine Section 10A in this context, it makes it clear that the Election Commission has to find out whether a person has failed to lodge an account of election expenses within the time and in the manner required by or under this Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
The specific expression by or under used in Section 10A(a) emphasizes that wherever the Act stipulates as regards the maintenance and the lodgment of the account, such stipulations in its substance would be the requirement for the verification to be made while holding an enquiry under Section 10A. Section 10A has been comprehensively enacted replacing earlier Sections 7(c) and 8(b) of the Act in order to ensure that the contesting candidate in an election cannot deal with the expenses in regard to the election in any manner he likes but such expenses can be incurred only in the manner required under the law.	None
Also, while incurring such expenditures, a true and correct account should also be maintained and such expenditure should not exceed the prescribed limit as is contemplated under Section 77(1) and (3) read with Rule 90.	None
If such a stringent provision for incurring election expenses has been brought into the statute book and if the real intent and purpose of such provisions are not understood and allowed to be implemented in its true spirit, in our considered opinion, it would provide scope for any contesting candidate to violate such a statutory requirement flagrantly and thereby, make the provision a dead letter.	None
Under Section 10A when the Election Commission, on being satisfied that a person failed to lodge an account of election expenses within the time specified and in the manner required by or under this Act, can pass an order of disqualification of such person for a period of three years from the date of its order, it is needless to state that such an exercise should be carried out by the Election Commission with utmost care and caution and not by merely finding that there is a statement of account claimed to be a true copy of the election expenses maintained by the candidate and that it was lodged with the DEO in the appropriate format.	None
In such an event, the concerned candidate can go scotfree even in a case where it can be brought to the notice of Election Commission that apart from the expenses disclosed in the statement of expenses lodged with the Election Commission, the candidate concerned had incurred various other expenses in a clandestine manner by adopting various manipulations and thereby, violating the requirement of law in particular Section 77(1) and (3) of the Act and thereby in effect not only cheat the electorate concerned, but even a constitutional authority in whom a very heavy responsibility has been invested under Article 324(1) of the Constitution.	None
In fact, the requirement of an enquiry to be made by the Election Commission at the instance of the President of the country under Article 103 and in the case of Members of Parliament under Article 192 by the Governor of the State in the case of Member of Legislative Assembly of the State, fortifies our above conclusion that even the President of the country and the Governor of a State can rely upon the report of the Election Commission based on an enquiry before taking a decision under Article 103(2) and under Article 192(2) of the Constitution.	None
Therefore, to call the Election Commissions responsibility before passing an order under Section 10A only to see the form and not substance as canvassed by the Appellant is a proposition too difficult to accept.	None
When we come to Section 143 falling under Chapter I of Part VII, the said provision needs to be examined alongside the explanation to subsection (1) and (6) of Section 123.	None
When we read the explanation to subsection (1), bribery is stipulated as one form of corrupt practices and yet proceeds to state that the act of bribery cannot be attributed to the payment of any expenses bona fide incurred for the purpose of any election and duly entered into the account of election expenses referred to in Section 78, i.e. the provision under which a contesting candidate is mandated to lodge, a true copy of the election expenses maintained by him, within 30 days from the date of the election of the returned candidate.	None
The said explanation further reinforces the fact that maintenance of expenses, as mandated under Section 77(1), should not only be correct, but also be bona fide expenses.	None
Therefore, even the explanation to subsection (1) to Section 123 makes it clear that incurring of election expenses and the maintenance of account of those expenses are not an empty formality but the very purpose of stipulating such restrictions and directions under Section 77(1) and (3) read along with Section 78 explains the mandate to maintain absolute purity in elections by the contesting candidates.	None
This is required in order to ensure that the process of the election is not sullied by resorting to unethical means while incurring election expenses.	None
It is common knowledge as is widely published in the Press and Media that nowadays in public elections payment of cash to the electorate is rampant and the Election Commission finds it extremely difficult to control such a menace.	None
There is no truthfulness in the attitude and actions of the contesting candidates in sticking to the requirement of law, in particular to Section 77 and there is every attempt being made to violate the restrictions imposed in the matter of incurring election expenses with a view to woo the electorate concerned and thereby, gaining their votes in their favour by corrupt means viz by purchasing the votes.	None
Therefore, this Court cannot turn a Nelsons eye and state that Section 77(1) and (3), as well as 78 would be relevant only for the purpose of ascertaining the corrupt practices under Section 123(6) of the Act and that such requirement of incurring bona fide and correct expenditure need not be a requirement for ascertainment for the Election Commission while exercising its powers under Section 10A of the Act.	None
In fact, ascertainment of the requirement under Section 77(3) viz the expenses incurred, do not exceed the limit prescribed and can be made both for the purpose of an enquiry under Section 10A, as well as in the event of a candidate exceeding the limit as a corrupt practice for the purpose of invalidating the election.	None
Therefore, the requirement under Section 77(3) has got twin objectives to be fulfilled.	None
One other relevant provision under the Act is Section 146 falling under Chapter IV of Part VIII.	None
Section 146 is relatable to Articles 103 and 192 of the Constitution.	None
As was noted earlier under Articles 103 and 192 of the Constitution in the case of a Member of Parliament or a Member of State Legislature for the purpose of ascertaining the fact about a member vacating his seat as a member, one of the requirements would be that such a member is disqualified by or under any law made by the Parliament.	None
It is needless to state that the act of disqualification referred to in Articles 102 or 190 of the Constitution, can be mainly referable to the law made by the Parliament viz the Representation of the People Act.	None
The decision of the President of India and the Governor of a State depends upon the opinion of the Election Commission.	None
Section 146 of the Act prescribes the procedure to be followed before rendering the opinion to the President of India or the Governor of a State.	None
When it is stipulated under Articles 102(1)(e) and 191(1)(e) to the effect that the ascertainment of vacation of a seat of a Member of Parliament or a Member of a State Legislature would depend upon a disqualification suffered by or under the provisions of the Act, it will have to be held that the procedure to be followed for passing such an order of disqualification should be befitting the requirement of Section 10A or otherwise when an opinion is sought for from the Election Commission under Article 103(2) or 192(2), it would be rather impossible for the Election Commission to sustain any such order of disqualification.	Reasoning
The Act in that respect cannot be held to have imposed in the Election Commission a responsibility which will not synchronise with the original order of disqualification to be made under Section 10A of the said Act and for the ultimate opinion to be rendered after such disqualification order is passed for the purpose of enabling the President of India and the Governor of a State to take appropriate decision for ascertaining the status of a member to vacate his seat as a Member of Parliament or State Legislature.	Reasoning
It would be incongruous to visualise such a situation while reading Articles 101 to 103 and 190 to 192 of the Constitution, read along with Sections 146 and 10A of the Act.	Reasoning
We, therefore, have no hesitation in asserting the legal position that an order to be passed under Section 10A of the said Act, could be no less important than an opinion to be rendered by the Election Commission under Section 146 when sought for by the President of India or the Governor of the concerned States.	Reasoning
In our considered opinion, therefore, the exercise to be made under Section 10A of the said Act would certainly include the requirement of not a farce of an enquiry but a true and complete one to determine whether the return of election expenses by an elected candidate is a true correct or false bogus return and that would not depend upon the decision of the Election Tribunal (High Court), which is provided under the Act for validating the election of a returned candidate on very many grounds set out in Section 123 of the Act, including the one under Section 123(6) which contemplates the compliance of the requirement under Sections 77 and 78 of the Act.	Reasoning
However, it will have to be stated that if the said issue was squarely dealt with by the Election Tribunal (High Court) based on the entire materials that were also placed before the Election Commission and the Election Tribunal (High Court) had dealt with the said issue in detail and recorded a finding after examining such materials threadbare, there is no reason for the Election Commission to give due weight to such a finding of the Election Tribunal (High Court) while exercising its jurisdiction under Section 10A.	Reasoning
With this we wish to deal with the various submissions of the respective counsel.	None
Before adverting to the submissions of the learned counsel for the respective parties, it will be in order to note the alleged violations committed by the Appellants in the above appeals, which prompted the Election Commission to initiate the present proceedings under Section 10A of the Act.	None
Insofar as the Appellant in the appeal ( SLP(C) No. 29882 of 2011) is concerned, there were three complaints at the instance of (i)	None
Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Member of Parliament, Bhartiya Janata Party and five others, (ii) Dr Madhavrao Kinhalkar, one of the rival contestants at the aforesaid general elections from 85 Bokar Assembly Constituency and (iii) Dr. Kirit Somaiya, VicePresident, Bhartiya Janata Party, Maharashtra and four others.	None
In their complaints submitted to the Election Commission towards the end of November 2009 and beginning of December 2009, it was alleged that the Appellant Ashok Shankarrao Chavan got several advertisements published in various newspapers, in particular, Lokmat, Pudhari, Maharashtra Times and Deshonnati during the election campaigning period, which appeared in those newspapers in the garb of news eulogizing him and his achievements as Chief Minister of Maharashtra.	None
It was further alleged that the huge expenditure, which they described, was incurred or authorized by the Appellant for getting those advertisements published as news and is now a wellknown phenomenon, as paid news.	None
The expenditure incurred or authorized on the publication of those paid news was not included by the Appellant in his account of election expenses as required under Section 77 of the Act and lodged with the DEO, Nanded under Section 78 of the Act.	None
The Complainants alleged that the Respondent showed only an expense of ?	None
5379/ as the expenses of newspaper advertisement in his account, whereas the expenditure on the above mentioned paid news ran into several crores and it was suppressed in his return of election expenses.	None
In the complaint dated 30.11.2009 of Shri Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and others, it was prayed that the account of the election expenses of the Respondent should be enquired into and action should be taken against him under Section 10A of the said Act.	None
Pursuant to the receipt of the above complaints, the Appellant was called upon to submit his comments by the Commission on 16.01.2010.	None
The Appellant submitted his reply on 29.01.2010 refuting all the allegations of the Complainants.	None
The reply was forwarded to the Complainants on 5th and 9th February, 2010 and the Complainants filed their rejoinders in February and March 2010.	None
The Commission decided to hear the parties on 11.06.2010.	None
In the meanwhile, the Commission also obtained the comments of the Chief Electoral Officer, Maharashtra about the four newspapers and the allegations of publishing paid news relating to the Appellant.	None
The impugned order of the Election Commission states that all the four newspapers denied the allegation of any payment having been made to them by the Respondent for the publication of the alleged paid news.	None
According to the newspaper establishments, the alleged paid news were in fact news or editorials and supplements published by them gratuitously as they had links with or leanings towards the Congress Party and the Appellant.	None
When the matter was posted for hearing, a preliminary objection was raised questioning the jurisdiction of the Election Commission to hold an elaborate enquiry in exercise of its powers under Section 10A and while dealing with said preliminary issue, the Election Commission relied upon the decision of this Court in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) and reached a conclusion that the commission had every jurisdiction under Section 10A to go into the question of alleged incorrectness or falsity of the election expenses maintained by the Appellant under Section 77(1) and (2) and lodged by him under Section 78 of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The Commission, therefore, decided to hear the matter on merits to be held on 29.04.2011 at 4 p.m. in the Commission Secretariat.	None
The said order was the subject matter of challenge.	None
The said order of the Election Commission came to be upheld by the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in the order impugned dated 30.09.2011 in Writ Petition (C) No. 2511 of 2011.	None
Insofar as the Appellant in the appeal ( SLP(C) No. 14209 of 2012) is concerned, he submitted his accounts of election expenses along with the register and vouchers to the tune of ?	None
18,92,353/  as per the requirements of Section 78 of the said act, to the DEO West Singhbhum, Chaibasa, Jharkhand on 01.06.2009, who in turn submitted this report to the Election Commission on 08.10.2010, as per the requirements of Rule 89 of the Rules.	None
It was alleged that the Election Commission after receiving the report failed to act as per the requirements of Rule 89(4), which envisaged the commission to decide the issue as soon as possible after the submission of the report by the DEO.	None
It was further alleged that after about 15 months from the submission of the report by the DEO, the Election Commission on 07.10.2010 issued a show cause notice under Rule 89(5) of the Rules to the Appellant, for the reason being that he failed to lodge his election expenses in the manner required by law and demanded as to why he shouldnt be disqualified under Section 10A of the said act.	None
Pursuant to his notice, the Appellant explained on 24.10.2010 that the vouchers were misplaced in the DEOs office and were again provided to the DEO on 08.10.2010 and therefore, requested the Election Commission to treat the notice dated 07.10.2010 as withdrawn.	None
Subsequent to this reply, it was alleged that the Election Commission, 4 months after the submission of the representation by the Appellant on 22.11.2011, again issued a fresh show cause notice to the him under Rule 89(5) read with Section 10A, stating therein that they were in further receipt of a report from the Income Tax Department, which alleged that prima facie, the account filed by the Appellant was incorrect and as to why he shouldnt be disqualified.	None
The Election Commission along with this notice, sent a copy of the alleged summary of findings by the Income Tax Department, which showed the election expenses incurred to the tune of ?	None
9,32,56,259/.	None
The authorized total expenditure of which account is to be kept and can be incurred in one parliamentary constituency in the state of Jharkhand as per Section 77 read with Rule 90 is ?	None
25,00,000/ .	None
The Appellant replied to this notice by stating that as he was in jail and was having severe health issues, and therefore, requested the Election Commission to grant him more time for inspecting the documents, to which a period of 20 days was granted.	None
The Election Commission subsequently passed an order on 02.02.2011 in the similar and identical case of Ashok Shankarrao Chavan, concluding that the Commission has undoubted jurisdiction under Section 10A to go into the question of the alleged incorrectness or falsity of the return by the candidate under Sections 77(1) and 77(2), lodged under Section 78.	None
Aggrieved by this order, the Appellant herein filed Writ Petition(C)	None
No. 4662 of 2011 before the Delhi High Court, which was thereby dismissed by the Court in view of the order already passed by it in Writ Petition (C) No. 2511 of 2011.	None
In so far as the appeal ( SLP(C) No. 21958 of 2013) is concerned, the Appellant was a candidate from 24 Bisauli Assembly Constituency U.P. in the General Assembly Election of 2007 from a party, namely, Rashtriya Parivartan Dal.	None
Sri Yogendra Kumar, the 2nd Respondent, was also a contesting candidate from the said constituency.	None
The polling in the constituency was scheduled to take place on 18.04.2007.	None
A day before the date of polling, a publication was made in a newspaper Amar Ujala dated 17.04.2007 mentioning that there is a wave in favour of the Appellant in the election and the voters have made up their mind to support the Appellant.	None
A similar publication was also made in the newspaper Dainik Jagaran dated 17.04.2007.	None
The poling took place on 18.04.2007 and the Appellant was declared as an elected member of the U.P. Legislative Assembly.	None
On 27.04.2007 a complaint was submitted by the Respondent No. 2 to the Press Council of India that the newspapers Amar Ujala and Dainik Jagaran, were in violation of journalistic conduct and have published one sided news item in the form of advertisement in favour of the Appellant by taking huge sums of money on 17.04.2007, i.e. after the close of the campaigning and the day before the poll.	None
On 12.05.2007 the Appellant submitted the accounts of his election expenses before District Election Officer as required by Section 77 and 78 of the Act.	None
The Press Council of India issued notices to both the newspapers on 09.08.2007, to which both the papers submitted their reply before the Press Council of India that the publication was not a news item but an advertisement.	None
It was stated in the reply that at the bottom, the word ADVT was appended and it was further submitted that the material, which was published was given to the Press on behalf of the Appellant and was not materials collected by the correspondents of the newspaper.	None
The Press Council thereby, decided the complaint vide order dated 31.03.2010, wherein it held that the publication though camouflaged as news items, in reality it was only an advertisement.	None
It further held that the newspapers Amar Ujala and Dainik Jagaran were guilty of ethical violation.	None
Subsequently, after receiving the order dated 31.03.2010 from the Press Council of India vide letter dated 04.05.2010, the Commission called for a report from the Chief Electoral Officer U.P. regarding expenditure on the advertisement dated 17.04.2010 to which the Chief Electoral Officer vide his letter dated 10.05.2010 forwarded the report dated 09.05.2010 of the DEO.	None
The DEO in his report had stated that the expenditure was not clear from the returns submitted by the Appellant.	None
The Election Commission thereby issued a notice dated 22.06.2010 to the Appellant stating that in the account of the election expenses, the expenditure incurred for the two advertisements dated 17.04.2007 were not reflected and thereby, attracted disqualification under Section 10A for a period of three years.	None
The Appellant thereby submitted a reply on 18.07.2010 stating that the publication of the above items in the newspapers were neither ordered by the Appellant nor by her election agent.	None
On 19.08.2010, the Election Commission requested the newspapers to send copies of all the relevant documents pertaining to the publication dated 17.04.2007.	None
On 06.01.2011, the Election Commission again wrote to the Appellant stating that the account of election expenses lodged by her as per Section 78 of the Act had not reflected the proper and correct expenditure and a hearing was thereby fixed on 04.02.2011.	None
In the hearing it was submitted by the Appellant that the advertisement given by her party was only in a small box size 7 x 6 cms.	None
for which an amount of ?840 was paid to the Daily Amar Ujala vide bill dated 17.04.2007.	None
The Election Commission after hearing the Appellant and the Respondent No. 2, vide its order dated 20.10.2011 held the Appellant to be guilty of breach of the provisions 78 and 10A of the Act and accordingly disqualified her for a period of three years.	None
Subsequent to this order, a writ petition was filed by her on 05.11.2011, challenging the order of the Election Commission in Writ Petition No. 63965 of 2011 before the Honble High Court of Allahabad, which dismissed the said writ petition vide the judgment and order dated 03.05.2013.	None
In recent times, when elections are being held it is widely reported in the Press and Media that money power plays a very vital role.	None
Going by such reports and if it is true then it is highly unfortunate that many of the voters are prepared to sell their votes for a few hundred rupees.	None
In fact, taking advantage of the weakness of the voters, exploitation to the maximum level is being carried out by those who aspire to become either Member of Parliament or State Legislature.	None
We are pained to state that the sanctity of the status as a Member of the Legislatures, either Parliament or State Legislature are not being seriously weighed even by those who sponsor their candidature.	None
It is a hard reality that if one is prepared to expend money to unimaginable limits only then can he be preferred to be nominated as a candidate for such membership, as against the credentials of genuine and deserving candidates.	None
If such practices are to be simply ignored and a laudable object with which the Act has been brought into the statute book as early as in the year 1950 and later on by the Act of 1951, wherein by virtue of the Constitutional provision under Article 324 an authority in the status of the Election Commission is created in order to supervise and control the elections, it must be stated that such an authority who is in ultimate control in the matter of holding of the elections should be held to be invested with the widest power of its kind specified in the Act.	None
Therefore, when it comes to the question of interpretation of the extent of such power to be exercised by the said authority, we are convinced that the Court should have a very liberal approach in interpreting the nature of power and jurisdiction vested with the said authority, namely, the Election Commission.	None
This view of ours is more so apt in the present day context, wherein money power virtually controls the whole field of election and that people are taken for a ride by such unscrupulous elements who want to gain the status of a Member of Parliament or the State Legislature by hook or crook.	None
In this context, we also keep in mind the Preamble to the Constitution which in liberal words states that the people of India having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a sovereign, social, secular, democratic, republic and to secure to all citizens justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.	None
In such a large democratic country such as ours, if purity in elections is not maintained and for that purpose when the constitution makers in their wisdom thought it fit to create an authority, namely, the Election Commission and invested with it the power of superintendence, control and also to issue directions, it must be stated that such power invested with the said constitutional authority should not be a mere empty formality but an effective and stable one, in whom the citizens of this country can repose in and look upon to ensure that such unscrupulous elements and their attempts to enter into political administration of this vast country are scuttled.	None
In that respect, since the ruling of this vast country is always in the hands of the elected representatives of the people, the enormous powers of the Election Commission as the guardian of democracy should be recognized.	None
It is unfortunate that those who are really interested in the welfare of society and who are incapable of indulging in any such corrupt practices are virtually sidelined and are treated as totally ineligible for contesting the elections.	None
Having noted the above features in the case of each of the Appellant which has gone before the Election Commission, wherein the impugned orders came to be passed, we proceed to deal with the submissions made on behalf of the Appellants, as well as the counsel for the Respondents and the learned counsel for the Election Commission.	None
In the first instance, Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant in the appeal (SLP(C) No. 29882 of 2011) submitted that one of the Complainants before the Election Commission who was an unsuccessful candidate in the very same election in which the Appellant was successfully elected, also challenged the said election in an Election Petition which was enquired into by the Election Tribunal (High Court) in Election Petition No. 11 of 2009 and that the same came to be dismissed for want of material facts.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said decision of the Election Tribunal (High Court) was also stated to be confirmed by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 9271 of 2012 in the order dated 21.01.2013.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel therefore, contended that the Election Tribunal (High Court) having concluded the issue while rejecting the Election Petition stated that there cannot be a further complaint before the Election Commission as the same is not permissible in law.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra, it was contended on behalf of the Respondents that the scope and jurisdiction of the Election Tribunal (High Court) is entirely different from the one conferred on the Election Commission under Section 10A of the Act and, therefore, the dismissal of the Election Petition preferred by one of the Complainants cannot be a ground to reject the complaint, which is required to be dealt with under Section 10A of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
We find force in the submission of the learned counsel for the Respondents.	Reasoning
As was pointed out by us earlier, the challenge to an election by way of an Election Petition is provided for under Article 329(b) of the Constitution and the manner in which such Election Petition is to be filed and the procedure to be followed were all set out in Sections 80 to 116 of the Act.	Reasoning
It is true that Article 329(b) specifically stipulates that no election can be called in question except by way of an Election Petition.	None
When we peruse the various stipulations contained in Sections 80 to 116 of the said Act, we find that under Section 80 it is reiterated that no election shall be called in question except by an Election Petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part, namely, Part VI of the Act.	None
Section 83 stipulates that an Election Petition should contain a concise statement of the material facts on which the Appellant relies, setforth full particulars of any corrupt practice that the Appellant alleges, including a full statement of the possible names of the parties alleged to have committed such corrupt practice and the date and place of the commission of each such practice, which should be signed by the Appellant concerned and verified in a manner as provided in the Code of Civil Procedure for verification of pleadings.	None
The proviso to Section 83(1) states that where the Appellant alleges any corrupt practice, the Petition should also be accompanied by an affidavit in the prescribed form in support of the allegation of such corrupt practice and the particulars thereof.	None
It is based on such contents in the Election Petition as provided under Section 83, the trial of Election Petition will be made by the Election Tribunal (High Court) and the various other provisions describe the procedures which are to be followed, including the relief to be ultimately granted which is provided for and that is the scope and ambit of jurisdiction that could be exercised by an Election Tribunal (High Court).	None
As compared to the nature of proceedings of an Election Petition, when we examine the scope and jurisdiction of the Election Commission under Section 10A, at the outset it must be stated that the power and jurisdiction therein does not clothe the Election Commission to deal with the successful election of the candidate concerned.	None
In other words, exercising power under Section 10A, the Election Commission cannot set aside the election of a successful candidate.	None
Section 10A talks of only an order of disqualification that can be passed by an Election Commission.	None
Further, such disqualification order can be passed for failure to lodge an account of election expenses and such failure was within the time and in the manner required by or under the Act.	None
Therefore, the scope of an Election Petition to be tried by an Election Tribunal (High Court) and the scope of an order of disqualification to be passed under Section 10A are entirely different and it must be stated that one does not conflict with the other.	None
The very same allegation of a corrupt practice may form part of the failure to lodge the account in the manner required by or under the Act as has been specified in Sections 77 and 78 of the Act in an Election Petition.	None
Therefore, simply because such an issue may form part of a corrupt practice as provided under Section 123(6) and the failure may be in contravention of Section 78 of the Act, it may also be one of the grounds in challenging the successful election of a candidate concerned in an Election Petition.	None
On that score, it cannot be held that the area of disqualification to be considered by the Election Commission, under Section 10A, is fully covered in an Election Petition and thereby, the power and jurisdiction of the Election Commission would stand excluded.	None
It cannot therefore, be contended that once the Election Petition having been rejected for want of particulars, which order has become final, a complaint under Section 10A cannot be pursued.	None
We therefore, reject the said contention raised on behalf of the Appellant.	None
The next submission of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant was that the provision for disqualification was originally incorporated in Section 7(c) of the 1950 Act, which has now been restructured in Section 10A, that the provision of Section 7(c) was interpreted by this Court in Sucheta Kripalini (supra), wherein this Court has ruled that the requirement of lodgment of the account of election expenses is only in form and not in substance and that the said legal position continued even after the introduction of Section 10A. The learned Senior Counsel while referring to the subsequent decision of this Court on Section 10A reported in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) contended that having regard to the fact that the decision in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) is the decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court, a contrary view expressed in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra), a three Judge Bench decision calls for reconsideration.	Arguments of Petitioner
Meeting the above submissions of the learned counsel for the Appellant, Mr. Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel and Mrs. Pinki Anand, learned Senior Counsel for the contesting Complainants before the Election Commission and Mr. Ashok Desai, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Election Commission, contended that the scope and ambit of Section 7(c) as it originally stood, as well as the subsequent amendments to it, read along with Section 8(b), was far different from the present Section 10A and, therefore, what was ruled while examining Section 7(c) of the 1950 Act in the decision reported in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) can have no application to the present Section 10A of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Senior Counsel, therefore, submitted that the decision in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra), which squarely dealt with the scope and power of the Election Commission as adumbrated in Section 10A alone would apply and the same does not call for any further reconsideration.	Arguments of Respondent
Having considered the respective submissions of the learned counsel, we are also convinced that the decision in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) does not call for reconsideration.	Reasoning
As rightly pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel for the Election Commission, as well as the other learned counsel for the Respondents, the scope and ambit of Section 7(c) has been widened by metes and bounds in Section 10A in its present form.	None
In Section 7(c), there is no reference to any positive order to be passed by any authority much less an Election Commission specifying the disqualification suffered.	None
On a reading of Section 7(c) along with Section 8(b), as it originally stood, there is no scope to hold that the failure to lodge a return of election expenses within the time and in the manner required by or under the Act can be examined by an Election Commission in a manner known to law.	None
Therefore, an order of disqualification to be passed based on such examination or enquiry should precede such an order.	None
On the contrary, as has been explained in detail about the scope of Section 10A read along with Section 77(1) and (3), Section 78 and Rules 86 to 90, we find that the failure to lodge an account of election expenses within the time and in the manner required by or under the Act would result in serious consequences and consequently, such a failure would result in an order of disqualification to be passed by the Election Commission.	None
When we read Section 10A as compared to Sections 7(c) and 8(b), as it originally stood, Section 10A in its very opening words, empowers the Election Commission on being satisfied about the defects in the lodging of the account of election expenses as contemplated under Section 77(1) and (3) read along with Section 78 and the Rules 86 to 90, to pass an order and publish it in the official gazette, as regards the disqualification period of which is prescribed as three years from the date of the order.	None
Such a detailed nature of power, now prescribed under Section 10A, was not provided for under Section 7(c) read along with Section 8(b), as it originally stood.	None
Further, a consideration of the implication of Articles 101(3)(a), 102(1)(e) and 103, as well as 190(3)(a), 191(1)(e) and 192 of the Constitution read along with Section 146 of the Act having been exhaustively noted by us in the earlier part of the judgment, it will have to be held that the power under Section 10A is wide enough for the Election Commission to deal with the issue of disqualification on the ground of failure to lodge the account of election expenses within the time and in the manner required by or under the Act for deciding the issue whether an order of disqualification should be passed against a contesting candidate.	None
In fact, while the scope of consideration by the Election Tribunal (High Court) will be in relation to the validity of election of a successful candidate by the other contesting candidates and the ultimate conclusion by the Election Tribunal (High Court) may be either validating the election or invalidating the election by setting it aside, the power under Section 10A would apply to all the candidates who contested in the election, who have to mandatorily comply with the requirement of Section 77(1) and (3) as well as Section 78 along with the prescribed rules in that respect.	None
Therefore, the submission that under Section 10A the Election Commission cannot venture to hold an enquiry for the purpose of passing an order of disqualification in the light of the decision of the Election Tribunal (High Court) in the case of the Appellant in the appeal ( SLP(C) 29882 of 2011) is a far fetched one.	None
As far as the earlier decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court reported in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) is concerned, the said decision having stated that the lodging of a return of election expenses is one of form and not of substance was held on the anvil of Section 7(c), as it originally stood, and since the ambit and scope of Section 10A which replaced Sections 7(c) and 8(b) of the 1950 Act being wider in ambit and scope and as also the power of the Election Commission has also been widened for passing an order of disqualification, the said decision can have no application.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, in the decision in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra), this Court after examining the implication of Section 10A has stated the legal position in uncontroverted terms as under in paragraph 22 22in our opinion, sub sections (6) of Section 10A takes care of the situation inasmuch as it provides for lodging an account of election expenses in the manner required by or under the Act.	None
Section 77(2) provides that the account shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed.	Arguments of Respondent
Rule 86 of the Conduct of Election Rules provides for the particulars to be set out in the account.	None
The said rule prescribes that a voucher shall be obtained for every item of expenditure and for lodging all vouchers along with the account of election expenses.	None
Rule 89 provides that the District Election Officer shall report to the Election Commission, the name of each contesting candidate, whether such candidate has lodge his account of election expenses, and if so, the date on which such account has been lodged and whether in his opinion, such account has been lodged within that time and in the manner required by the Act and the Rules.	None
That rule enables the Election Commission to decide whether a contesting candidate has failed to lodge his account of election expenses within the time and in the manner required by the Act after adopting the procedure mentioned therein.	Arguments of Petitioner
If an account is found to be incorrect or untrue by the Election Commission after enquiry under Rule 89, it could be held that the candidate had failed to lodge his account within the meaning of Section 10A and the Election Commission may disqualify the said person.	None
Hence, we do not find any substance in the argument of learned counsel for the first respondent.	None
Therefore, the said conclusion reached by this Court in the said decision fully covers the issue raised and we hold that the order of the Election Commission, which has now been upheld by the High Court in stating that it has got every jurisdiction to enquire into the complaint made before it as regards the incorrect and untrue statement of accounts of election expenses lodged by the Appellant can be enquired into for the purpose of passing an order of disqualification under Section 10A, is perfectly justified.	Reasoning
The contention of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel that the proposed action of the Election Commission to conduct an enquiry under Section 10A would conflict with the power to be exercised in an Election Petition under Article 329(b) and thereby ultimately in the event of an order of disqualification being passed would result in virtually setting aside the election of a successful candidate and therefore the impugned order of the Election Commission, as confirmed by the High Court, cannot be sustained.	Arguments of Petitioner
In dealing with the said contention, it will have to be noted that having regard to the scope of Articles 101 to 103 and 190 to 192 of the Constitution, any order of disqualification passed against a Member of Parliament or a Member of a Legislature will have to be considered by the President of India and the Governor of a State respectively for taking a decision as to the consequence that should follow by reason of such an order of disqualification.	None
Even at that stage, there is another filter point in the form of an opinion to be rendered by the Election Commission to the President of India or the Governor of the State before taking a decision as to whether the member elected should vacate his office pursuant to such disqualification.	Reasoning
For the reasons which we have elaborately stated while dealing with the scope and power of jurisdiction of the Election Tribunal (High Court) and the power of the Election Commission under Section 10A, it will have to be stated that the said submission no longer survives for consideration.	Reasoning
The same is, therefore, rejected.	Reasoning
The other submission of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel was on the issue of locus standi.	Arguments of Petitioner
The contention was that the Complainants were neither voters nor losing candidates, that the legislative scheme does not provide for an opportunity to a person who wishes to oppose the explanation offered by the candidate and that though Section 10A applies to all candidates, the Election Petition can be filed only against an elected candidate.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was therefore contended that the complainants have no way to invoke Section 10A and that if at all any enquiry can be held by the Election Commission, it can be only under Articles 103 or 192 at the instance of the President of India or the Governor of the State.	Arguments of Petitioner
To counter the said submission, it was contended by Mr. Jayant Bhushan, Ms. Pinki Anand and Mr. Ashok Desai, learned Senior Counsel and Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel that such a restricted meaning cannot be applied to Section 10A.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel for the Respondents by referring to Section 10A and the Rules, in particular Rule 88 pointed out that under Rule 88, after the account of election expenses are lodged with the DEO, as stipulated under Rule 87, any person is entitled on payment of nominal fee of ?1 to inspect such account and on payment of such other fee prescribed or fixed by the Election Commission, is also entitled to obtain attested copies of such accounts or of any part thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel, therefore, contended that the very right given to a citizen or a voter to seek for inspection of the account of election expenses submitted by a candidate and also get attested copies of such account, would show that the said person who seeks for such inspection and gets a copy will have every consequential right to move the appropriate authorities to point out any illegality committed in the submission of the account of election expenses.	Arguments of Respondent
When we consider the above submission, we find force in the submissions of the learned counsel for the Respondents.	Reasoning
Reading Section 10A along with Rules 87 to 90, in particular, the right conferred on any person to seek for inspection of the accounts submitted, it will have to be held that such a right is not conferred merely to look into the details of the account.	Reasoning
If based on the inspection, made by a person under Rule 88 and the attested copies of such accounts disclose that the candidate concerned committed a very serious illegality in the matter of submission of the account of election expenses, it must be stated that such a person will have every right to bring it to the notice of the Election Commission for taking appropriate legal recourse available to that person under the Act.	Reasoning
It may be stated that once any such misfeasance in the submission of the account of the election expenses is brought to the notice of the Election Commission, thereafter it would be for the Election Commission to set the process in motion for deciding the issue as contemplated in Section 10A of the Act.	Reasoning
It cannot be said that no person can by way of a complaint approach the Election Commission.	Reasoning
The conduct of election being in the realm of public domain, the operation of such election would take place in each constituency, in an area spread over the whole of the constituency.	None
It will have to be stated that the Election Commission may not be in a position to have access to any kind of illegality or irregularity indulged in by the candidates concerned, irrespective of the various personnel such as Election officers, security personnel, etc. functioning exclusively for the purpose of holding the election under the control of the Election Commission.	None
Therefore, such instances of illegalities committed by the candidates contesting in the election in certain areas of the constituency may come to the notice of some individuals, which may have a serious ramification relating to the conduct of the candidate by abusing the process of the election with the aid of money power available with such candidate.	None
Therefore, if someone is able to assert such misuse of funds in the process of election by a candidate by making an inspection under Rule 88 and if the concerned individual finds out that such misuse of funds had taken place, which was not disclosed in the statement of account of election expenses, he will have every right to bring it to the notice of the Election Commission and the very purport of providing such a right under Rule 87 and 88 when read along with Section 10A makes it clear that he would have every locus to prefer a complaint.	Reasoning
Also in the course of an enquiry made under Section 10A, the Election Commission can call upon the concerned individual to substantiate the complaint with relevant materials to enable the Election Commission to pass appropriate orders of disqualification under the said Section.	None
Therefore, the contention of learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant that the Complainants have no locus cannot be accepted.	None
In fact, apart from the complaints of the individuals, in the case of the Appellant in the appeal ( SLP(C) No. 29882 of 2011) and in the case of the Appellants in the other appeals, such illegality in the matter of accounts of the election expenses was brought to the notice of the Election Commission by the Press Council of India in one case and by the Board of Direct Taxes in the other.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even if some motive can be attributed to the complaints made by the individuals, we see no reason why bodies like the Press Council of India and the statutory body, namely, Board of Direct Taxes should have any malice or motive against the candidates concerned, namely, the Appellants while bringing the illegalities committed by the Appellants to the notice of the Election Commission.	None
Therefore, the contention based on locus of the Complainants has absolutely no substance and the same stands rejected.	None
Having dealt with the submission made on behalf of the Appellant, we also wish to find out whether the reliance placed upon various decisions by the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant support the stand of the Appellant.	None
Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel relied upon N.P. Ponnuswami (supra), a Constitution Bench decision of six Judges.	None
In the said case, the point raised based on Article 329(b) was noted as under in Paragraph 5 It was conceded at the Bar that the effect of this difference in language is what (that)	None
whereas any law made by Parliament under Article 327, or by the State Legislatures under Article 328, cannot exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, that jurisdiction is excluded in regard to matters provided for in Article 329.	None
That was a case where the nomination of a candidate rejected by the returning officer could be challenged only by of an Election Petition under Section 329(b) and if that be so, whether any other proceedings could be resorted to including a proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging the rejection of the nomination.	Reasoning
Dealing with that situation, this Court held that the word election can be and has been appropriately used with reference to the entire process, which consists of several stages and embraces many steps some of which may have important bearing on the result of the process.	Reasoning
Therefore, it was held that if the grounds on which an election can be called in question, could be raised at an earlier stage and the errors, if any, are rectified there will be no meaning in enacting a provision like Article 329(b) and in setting up a Special Tribunal.	Reasoning
It was further held that any other meaning ascribed to the words used in the Article would lead to anomalies which the Constitution could not have contemplated, one of them being that conflicting views may be expressed by the High Court at the prepolling stage and by the Election Tribunal, which is to be an independent body at the stage when the matter is brought up before it.	Reasoning
In the light of the situation in which the overall jurisdiction of the Election Tribunal (High Court) relating to a challenge that can be made to an election can be made as provided under Article 329(b), this Court having held that the word election would include very many process till the completion of the polling and the declaration of the result and, therefore, there cannot be a piecemeal challenge permitted to be made by way of a Writ Petition under Article 226.	Reasoning
The said proposition of law, as declared by this Court, can never be controverted.	Reasoning
In the case on hand, there was no attempt made by anyone to challenge the election of the Appellant by resorting to a complaint which has emanated in the form of proceeding under Section 10A by the Election Commission.	Reasoning
In fact, in a proceeding under Section 10A, there is no scope or power vested with Election Commission to declare the election as invalid.	Reasoning
Therefore, there is no question of any violation of Article 329(b) that would arise in the case on hand.	Reasoning
We, therefore, do not find any support from the said decision for the Appellant.	Reasoning
The Appellant then relied upon the decision reported in Surinder Singh Banolta (supra).	Arguments of Petitioner
In the said decision, reliance was placed upon Paragraph 18, wherein it was stated as under If a candidate or a voter had the knowledge that the elected candidate was disqualified in terms of Section 122 of the Act, he may file an application.	Arguments of Petitioner
The order of eviction may come to the notice of some other person after the election process is over.	Arguments of Petitioner
A situation, thus, may arise where two different proceedings may lie before two different authorities at the instance of two different persons.	Arguments of Petitioner
Two parallel proceedings, it is well settled, cannot be allowed to continue at the same time.	Arguments of Petitioner
A construction of a statute which may lead to such a situation, therefore, must be avoided.	Arguments of Petitioner
It will also lead to an absurdity if two different tribunals are allowed to come to contradictory decisions.	Arguments of Petitioner
To understand the principle stated in the said paragraph, it will have to be noted that under the Himachal Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, Section 122 provided for various circumstances which would disqualify a person from being Member of a Panchayat or from being chosen as a Member of Panchayat.	None
After setting out this various situations under which such a disqualification will occur, as far as the remedy is concerned, it was noted that the same is provided in Sections 163, 174 and 175 of the Act by which if anyone wanted to contend that a particular person is disqualified from being a member or to be chosen as a Member of Panchayat, the only remedy is by way of an Election Petition and not otherwise.	None
In the said case, one of the contestants was held to be disqualified based on another proceeding where he was found to have encroached public lands and was directed to be ejected from the land in question, which was one of the circumstances under which he came to be disqualified as prescribed under Section 122(1) of the Act.	None
The person who alleged such disqualification as against the contestant, moved the Deputy Commissioner, who took cognizance of the said complaint and by an order dated 04.06.2002, declared the contestant as disqualified from being chosen as a Member of the Zila Parishad and consequently, his election was set aside.	None
On finding that such a power was not invested with a Deputy Commissioner under the said Act and that the only remedy available to the Complainant was by way of an Election Petition as provided under Section 163 read with Sections 174 and 175 of the Act, this Court held that such parallel proceedings cannot be permitted.	None
We do not find any scope to apply the said decision to the case on hand.	Reasoning
We have elaborately noted the scheme of the Act by which the scope of the Election Petition as contained in Sections 79 to 116 was noted, as against the power and jurisdiction of the Election Commission to pass an order of disqualification under Section 10A, which does not deal with the validity of the election but is only concerned with the failure to lodge a statement of election expenses in the manner as required by or under the Act, for the purpose of passing an order of disqualification.	Reasoning
In the light of such statutory prescription contained in the Act clearly distinguishing the different role to be played by an Election Tribunal (High Court) and the Election Commission as compared to the provisions contained in the Himachal Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1994, the said decision also does not support the stand of the Appellant.77.	Reasoning
Reliance was also placed upon Dalchand Jain (supra) to contend that suppression of certain expenses incurred in the election while submitting the return as stipulated under Section 77 would amount to a corrupt practice as specified in Section 123(6) and consequently, in that case on finding that such non disclosure of expenditure amounted to corrupt practice, the election was set aside by an Election Tribunal (High Court).	Reasoning
When the said order of the Election Tribunal (High Court) was challenged before this Court, after examining the factual matrix in detail, this Court upheld the order of the Election Tribunal (High Court) holding that the same did not call for any interference.	Reasoning
It will have to be stated that the said decision can have no application to the case on hand, inasmuch as, the question whether the jurisdiction of the Election Commission under Section 10A would stand excluded by virtue of the dismissal of an Election Petition by the Election Tribunal (High Court) at the instance of one of the Complainants in the case of the Appellant in the appeal ( SLP(C) No. 29882 of 2011) was not the point in issue.	Reasoning
There was also no issue raised as to whether as a general proposition of law, jurisdiction under Section 10A of the Act for passing an order of disqualification for failure to lodge the account in the manner and as required by or under the Act can only be raised as a ground of attack for setting aside an election before the Election Tribunal (High Court).	Reasoning
Therefore, we do not find any scope to apply the said decision to the facts of this case.78.	Reasoning
Reliance was then placed upon a Constitution Bench decision of this Court reported in Brundaban Nayak (supra).	Reasoning
In the said judgment, which was prior to the introduction of Section 10A and the corresponding Rules, relating to the said section.	Reasoning
In Paragraph 19, after noting the observations made by the Chief Election Officer, while rendering its opinion at the request of the Governor as provided under Article 192 of the Constitution, when relevant facts are in dispute it can be ascertained only after a proper enquiry, this Court observed as under in paragraph 19 19We would like to invite the attention of parliament to these observations, because we think that the difficulty experienced by Election Commission in rendering its opinion under Article 103 (2) or Article 192 (2) appears to be genuine and so parliament may well consider whether the suggestion made by the Chief Election Commissioner should not be accepted and appropriate legislation adopted in that behalf.	Reasoning
In fact, Section 146 of the Act, which came to be introduced with effect from 22.09.1965 apparently was in compliance with the above observations made by this Court under which provision, the Election Commission has now been invested with all the powers.	None
Apart from the above observations, it will be worthwhile to note the conclusion arrived at by this Court in Brundaban Nayak (supra) in paragraph 18, which reads as under In this connection, we ought to point out that so far the practice followed in respect of such complaints has consistently recognised that the enquiry is to be held by the Election Commission both under Article 192(2) and Article 103(2).	Reasoning
In fact, the learned AttorneyGeneral for Respondent 1 stated before us that though on several occasions, the Election Commission has held enquiries before communicating its opinion either to the President under Article 103(2) or to the Governor under Article 192(2), no one ever thought of raising the contention that the enquiry must be held by the President or the Governor respectively under Article 103(1) and Article 192(1).	None
He suggested that the main object of the appellant in taking such a plea was to prolong the proceedings before Respondent 1.	None
In the first instance, the appellant asked for a long adjournment and when that request was refused by Respondent 1, he adopted the present proceedings solely with the object of avoiding an early decision by the Governor on the complaint made against the appellant by Respondent 2.	None
We cannot say that there is no substance in this suggestion.	None
A reading of the above paragraph also shows that even in the absence of Section 146, this Court has recognized the power of the Election Commission to hold an enquiry whenever a complaint of disqualification is raised as against a member.	None
Therefore, the said decision fully supports the stand of the Election Commission, rather than the case of the Appellant.	None
The reliance placed upon the decision of this Court in Jagan Nath (supra) is totally misconceived, inasmuch as, the said judgment came to be rendered when there was a specific provision in subsection (1) and (2) of Sections 100 and 101 by which an election of a successful candidate can be called in question by way of an Election Petition before the Election Commission itself.	Reasoning
Inasmuch as the said power vested with the Election Commission is no longer available under the said provisions, which has now been entrusted with the Election Tribunal (High Court) alone, the reliance placed upon the said decision is of no use to the Appellant.	Reasoning
The learned Senior Counsel also placed reliance upon the decision reported in Kanwar Singh Saini (supra).	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference was made to paragraphs 22 and 23, which are as under There can be no dispute regarding the settled legal proposition that conferment of jurisdiction is a legislative function and it can neither be conferred with the consent of the parties nor by a superior court, and if the court passes order decree having no jurisdiction over the matter, it would amount to a nullity as the matter goes to the roots of the cause.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such an issue can be raised at any belated stage of the proceedings including in appeal or execution.	Arguments of Petitioner
The finding of a court or tribunal becomes irrelevant and unenforceable inexecutable once the forum is found to have no jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
Acquiescence of a party equally should not be permitted to defeat the legislative animation.	Arguments of Petitioner
The court cannot derive jurisdiction apart from the statute.23.	Arguments of Petitioner
When a statute gives a right and provides a forum for adjudication of rights, remedy has to be sought only under the provisions of that Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
When an Act creates a right or obligation and enforces the performance thereof in a specified manner, that performance cannot be enforced in any other manner.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus for enforcement of a right obligation under a statute, the only remedy available to the person aggrieved is to get adjudication of rights under the said Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
No one can quarrel with the proposition as laid down in the above paragraphs.	Reasoning
The question is whether under Section 10A and the other alleged provisions under the Act, as well as, the Rules, such a power has been invested with the Election Commission.	Reasoning
We have elaborately referred to the various provisions in the Act, as well as the Rules in particular Section 10A, Section 77(1) and (3), Section 78 read along with Rules 86 to 90 and have held that such a power to hold an enquiry before passing an order of disqualification under Section 10A has been invested with the Election Commission.	Reasoning
Therefore, even applying the above said principles, we do not find any scope to take a different view.84.	Reasoning
We do not find any support from the decision relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel on Andhra Provincial Potteries Ltd. Ors.	Reasoning
(supra).	Reasoning
Reliance was placed upon the principle stated in paragraph 7, wherein it was held that in interpreting a penal provision, it is not permissible to give an extended meaning to the plain words of the Section.	Reasoning
Inasmuch as the said principle has been stated while interpreting a penal provision, it will have to be stated that the said principle cannot be applied while interpreting Section 10A.	Reasoning
In any event we have found that in Rule 89 subrule (5), it has been specifically provided that the Election Commission should issue a show cause notice for the purpose of passing any order of disqualification under Section 10A calling upon the candidate concerned to submit its representation in writing.	Reasoning
Under subrule (6) of Rule 89 it has been further clarified that a contesting candidate who has been called upon to show cause under subrule (5) may within 20 days of the receipt of such notice, submit a representation in writing to the Election Commission simultaneously forwarding a copy to the DEO together with a complete account of his election expenses if he had not already furnished such an account.	Reasoning
Therefore, reading subrule (5) and (6) of Rule 89 along with Section 10A, the position is explicitly clear that the Election Commission, while invoking its power under Section 10A has to necessarily issue a show cause notice calling upon the contesting candidate to submit his reply and after the receipt of the reply to the said show cause notice, consider whether the statement of account was lodged in the manner and as required by or under the Act and only thereafter, pass an order of either disqualification or otherwise.	Reasoning
Therefore, the said decision also does not come for the rescue of the Appellant.	None
The decision reported in Tukaram S. Dighole (supra) was relied upon to highlight that a charge of corrupt practice envisaged by the Act is equated with the criminal charge and, therefore, the standard of proof would not be the preponderance of probabilities, as in a civil action, but proof beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal trial.	None
Paragraph 10 of the said decision was relied upon for the above proposition, which reads as under Mr K.V. Viswanathan, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the respondent, on the other hand, supported the decision of the Tribunal and submitted that apart from the fact that there was no specific pleading in the election petition with regard to the mode of acquisition of the cassette in question, even if it was assumed that the said cassette was a public document yet in order to attract the provisions of Section 123 of the Act, the appellant was required to prove with cogent evidence that the speeches recorded therein were, in fact, made by the respondent and his agents.	None
In support of the proposition that unless a document is exhibited at the trial and is put in evidence it cannot be looked into, reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in Amar Nath Agarwalla v. Dhillon Transport Agency.	None
Learned counsel asserted that the finding recorded by the Tribunal on the issue, being a pure finding of fact, no interference is called for.	None
In the first place, the enquiry to be held under Section 10A is not to examine any allegation of corrupt practice falling under Section 123 of the Act.	None
The only area of examination to be made in an enquiry under Section 10A is with regard to the lodging of the account of election expenses and whether such lodgment was done in the manner and as required by or under the Act.	None
In the second place, when such an enquiry is held, the scope would be as contained in Section 77(1) and (3) as well as Section 78.	None
The said provisions require a contesting candidate to maintain a true and correct account of the election expenses to ensure that such expenses are within the limits prescribed under the Act and that a copy of such statement of accounts is filed within the time prescribed under Section 78.	Arguments of Respondent
When it comes to the question of a corrupt practice under Section 123, it is needless to state that the scope of examination of the said issue would be within the four corners of an Election Petition, as has been prescribed in Chapter I of Part VI of the Act to Chapter V of the Act.	None
At the risk of repetition it will have to be reiterated that the enquiry under Section 10A would be more or less of a civil nature and therefore, the principles of preponderance of probabilities alone would apply and it is relevant to note that even after the order of disqualification, if any, is passed under Section 10A, after following the requirement of issuance of show cause notice, receipt of reply, etc., there is a further remedy available to the contesting candidate under Section 11 by which the aggrieved candidate can demonstrate before the Election Commission as to how the order of disqualification cannot stand and that it has to be varied.	None
Even if by invoking Section 11 the aggrieved candidate is not able to get his grievance redressed, the Constitutional remedy under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution is always available to question the correctness of any order that may be passed by the Election Commission under Sections 10A and 11 of the Act.	None
Reliance was placed upon the recent decision of this Court reported in Secretary, A.P.D. Jain Pathshala Ors.	Reasoning
(supra) for the proposition that ad hoc authorities cannot be permitted to exercise judicial functions and that the executive power of the State cannot be extended to creating Judicial Tribunals or Authorities exercising juridical powers and rendering judicial decisions.	Reasoning
The said decision came to be rendered while examining the scope of binding nature of a decision rendered by a three member Grievance Redressal Committee constituted under a scheme called Shikshan Sevak Scheme in all recognized private secondary higher secondary school junior colleges B.Ed.	Reasoning
colleges in the State of Maharashtra.	Reasoning
Such a scheme was not under any statute or was not governed by any statutory provision.	Reasoning
In examining the scope of authority of such a committee called Grievance Redrassal Committee formed under a scheme in the purported exercise of executive authority, this Court held that constitution of a Grievance Committee, as a public adjudicatory forum whose decisions are supposedly binding on the parties to the dispute pursuant to executive order of the Government, was impermissible.	Reasoning
We do not find any scope to apply the said decision, inasmuch as, there is a world of difference as between the Constitution of a Grievance Redressal Committee under a Scheme with no statutory support and the existence of a Constitutional Authority, viz the Election Commission, created under the Constitution of India, which has been invested with the powers of superintendence, control and issuance of directions for the purpose of holding public elections in this country, apart from the entrustment of specific powers under the Act, inter alia, under Section 10A and 11 and such powers are to be exercised in accordance with the Rules, viz the Conduct of the Election Rules.	Reasoning
The said decision also, therefore, does not help the Appellant.88.	Reasoning
We find that the reliance placed upon the decision reported in Election Commission of India Through Secretary (supra) is not applicable to the case on hand, inasmuch as, in the said decision, the question posed for consideration was as to what extent Article 329(b) had overriding effect on Article 226 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
This Court as a proposition of law stated that if the petition presented to the Court calls in question an election, the bar of Article 329(b) is attracted, else it is not.	Reasoning
We do no find any reference to any of the issues which arise for consideration in the case on hand in the said judgment.	Reasoning
Therefore, the said decision also does not support the case of the Appellant.89.	Reasoning
Reliance was placed upon the decision reported in Bharat Aluminium Company (supra) paragraphs 165, 166 and 168 for the proposition that the legislation cannot be construed contrary to Parliaments intention, just to avoid any hardship.	Reasoning
In support of his contention, he submitted that the complainants before the Election Commission have no locus standi to raise the issue under	Reasoning
Section 10A.	Reasoning
We have found that the power in Election Commission under Section 10A is inherent.	Reasoning
We have also held by making reference to Sections 77 (1), (2) (3) and 78, read along with Rules 86 to 90 that there is every right in any member of the electorate who is entitled to seek for inspection of the account submitted by a candidate and also get the authenticated copy of such statement.	Reasoning
He is also entitled to bring to the notice of the Election Commission any serious flaw in the account of election expenses submitted by a contesting candidate.90.	Reasoning
Our conclusion is, therefore, based on an interpretation of the statutory provisions in the Act, as well as the Rules.	Reasoning
Therefore, the reliance placed upon the decisions reported in Bharat Aluminium Company (supra) and M. Karunanidhi (supra) does not support the case of the Appellant.91.	Reasoning
The decision reported in Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) was relied upon for the proposition that a decision delivered by a larger Bench is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal strength.	Reasoning
The submission was that the decision rendered in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) is a Constitution Bench decision, while the one rendered in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) is by three Judge Bench and that since the Constitution Bench decision covered the issue, the same should have been followed and, therefore, the law laid down in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) need not be followed.92.	Reasoning
Having considered the said submission of the learned Senior Counsel Mr. Gopal Subramanium in the earlier part of the judgment while examining the then existing Section 7(c) and 8(b) and insertion of Section 10A replacing the earlier Section 7(c) and 8(b), we have held that the ratio laid down in Sucheta Kripalani based on Section 7(c) and 8(b), cannot be applied and that decision in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra), which came to be rendered after the insertion of Section 10A alone would apply.	Reasoning
We have examined in detail as to how the insertion of Section 10A in the place of Section 7(c) and 8(b) has widened the powers and scope of the Election Commission for passing an order of disqualification which was squarely considered by this court in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra).	Reasoning
In the light of the said position, the reliance placed upon Siddharam Satlingappa Mhetre (supra) is also of no assistance to the Appellant.	Reasoning
Mr. L. Nageshwar Rao, learned Additional Solicitor General relied upon Bharat Aluminum Co. (supra), a Constitution Bench decision of this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Our attention was drawn to paragraph 65 where the decision of the House of Lords has been quoted reported in Duport Steels Ltd. v. Sirs, (1980)1 WLR 142.	Arguments of Respondent
The specific reference was made to the expression Where the meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous it is not for the Judges to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse for failing to give effect to its plain meaning because they themselves consider that the consequences of doing so would be inexpedient or even unjust or immoral.	Arguments of Respondent
We must state that there is no scope for applying the said principle to the case on hand, inasmuch as, while interpreting Section 10A, we have only attempted to highlight what the said provision literally means.	None
We have neither attempted to make an interpretation which thereby widens the scope of the provision.	None
We have only analyzed the said provision for the working of which Rules have also been framed and by reading Section 10A along with the said Rules, and we wish to point out that the many expressions and ingredients set out in the Section itself, read along with Rules disclose what is the nature and extent of power that has been invested with the Election Commission.	None
Since this Court has not attempted to enlarge the scope of Section 10A and the allied Rules, we do not find any scope to apply the above referred to statement quoted in paragraph 65 of the said judgment.	None
The learned Additional Solicitor General also placed reliance upon a three Judge Bench decision of this Court reported in Sales Tax Officer v. K.I.	Arguments of Respondent
Abraham (supra).	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance was placed upon page 522, while interpreting the phrase in the prescribed manner in Section 8(4), read with Section 13 of the Central Sales Tax Act, wherein it was held as under The decision of the question at issue therefore depends on the construction of the phrase in the prescribed manner in s. 8(4) read with s.13 of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
In our opinion, the phrase in the prescribed manner occurring in s. 8(4) of the Act only confers power on the rulemaking authority to prescribe a rule stating what particulars are to be mentioned in the prescribed form, the nature and value of the goods sold, the parties to whom they are sold, and to which authority the form is to be furnished.	Arguments of Respondent
But the phrase in the prescribed manner in s. 8(4) does not take in the time element.	Arguments of Respondent
In other words, the section does not authorize the rulemaking authority to prescribe a time limit within which the declaration is to be filed by the registered dealerThis makes it clear that the Legislature was conscious of the fact that the expression in the manner would denote only the mode in which an act was to be done, and if any time limit was to be prescribed for the doing of the act, specific words such as the time within which were also necessary to be put in the statute.	Arguments of Respondent
In Strouds Judicial Dictionary it is said that the words manner and form refer only to the mode in which the thing is to be done, and do not introduce anything from the Act referred to as to the thing which is to be done or the time for doing it	None
We do not find any scope to apply the said decision to the case on hand.	Reasoning
What was highlighted in the said decision was that though the phrase mentioned in the prescribed manner in Section 8 (4), yet significantly there was no prescription of any time limit.	Reasoning
The authority on its own prescribed the time limit, and therefore, it was held that when such a prescription was not found in the Act, it was not within the authority of the concerned assessing authority to prescribe any time limit.	Reasoning
In fact, there was no challenge to the authority exercised by the concerned officer.	Reasoning
What was held was that while exercising the authority, there was exercise of jurisdiction by prescribing a time limit which was not provided for in the statute.	Reasoning
We are dealing with a case where the power prescribed under Section 10A of the Act provides that the Election Commission on finding that the lodgment of the account of election expenses was not in the manner prescribed and as required under the Act can pass an order of disqualification.	Reasoning
The question is when Section 77(1) and (3) of the Act read with section 78, which prescribe a time limit within which the lodgment of account should be made by a contesting candidate considering the rules prescribed in Section 89, whether the Election Commission is invested with the powers to examine the statement of account lodged by a contesting candidate and find out whether such lodgment of the account was within the time prescribed and that it reflected a true, correct and bona fide accounts.	Reasoning
Therefore, when such prescriptions are contained in the Act and the Election Commission has to only find out whether such prescriptions in the other provisions of the Act have been duly complied with or not, we fail to see any ground to apply the ratio of the above decision to the case on hand.	Reasoning
Therefore, the said decision also does not support the stand of the Union of India.	Reasoning
When we consider the submission of Mr. Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel pointing out the distinguishing feature in the case of Sucheta Kripalani (supra), which came to be rendered when Section 7 (c) was as it originally stood was to be applied along with Section 143 of the Act, this Court in paragraph 11 stressed the point that under Section 143, which specifically prescribes that a return is found to be in accordance with Section 77 of the Act, the jurisdiction was vested with the Election Tribunal (High Court) in an election petition to find out whether the return contained falsity in material particulars.	None
The learned Senior Counsel, therefore, submitted that what was held in paragraph 30 that in the light of the said Section 143, which was prevailing then, this Court when examining the jurisdiction of the Election Commission to pass an order of disqualification, stated in paragraph 30 that it is a question of form and not of substance.	None
The learned Senior Counsel also pointed out that since now section 143 itself has been removed from the Act and the scope of power of Election Commission has been incorporated in Section 10A as against the then Section 7(c) and 8(b), the decision in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) can have no application to the case on hand.	None
A reading of the decision in Sucheta Kripalani (supra), particularly paragraphs 11 and 12 really support the above stand of the learned Senior Counsel.	None
Paragraphs 11 and 12 are as under Section 76 of the Act requires every candidate to file a return of election expenses in a particular form containing certain prescribed particulars.	None
The form and particulars are set out in the Rules.	None
Section 143 prescribes the penalty for failure to observe those requirements.	None
It is disqualification.	None
This ensues if there is a default in making the return.	None
It also ensues if such a return is found upon the trial of an election petition under Part VI to be false in any material particular.12.	None
That places the matter beyond doubt.	None
The trial of an election petition is conducted by an Election Tribunal and this section makes it incumbent on the Tribunal to enquire into the falsity of a return when that is a matter raised and placed in issue and the allegations are reasonably connected with other allegations about a major corrupt practice.	None
The jurisdiction is that of the Tribunal and not of the Election Commission.	None
The duty of the Election Commission is merely to decide under Rule 114(4) whether any candidate has, among other things,failed to lodge the return of election expenses in the manner required by the Act and these rules.	None
Inasmuch as Section 143 has now been removed from the statute book, while at the same time the prescription in Section 10A which has now replaced the earlier Sections 7(c) and 8(b) of the 1950 Act, has prescribed clear and unambiguous power in the Election Commission to find out whether the lodgment of account of election expenses was in the manner and as required by or under the Act, as was pointed by us earlier, the decision in Sucheta Kripalani (supra) can have no application to the case on hand and that the subsequent decision in L.R. Shivaramagowda (supra) would alone apply.	Arguments of Petitioner

Paragraph 96 of the said judgment is to the following effect In the process of statutory construction, the court must construe the Act before it bearing in mind the legal maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat which means it is better for a thing to have effect than for it to be made void i.e. a statute must be construed in such a manner so as to make it workable.

Viscount Simon, L.C. in Nokes v. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd. stated as follows (AC p. 1022)if	None
the choice is between two interpretations, the narrower of which would fail to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation, we should avoid a construction which would reduce the legislation to futility and should rather accept the bolder construction based on the view that Parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result.	None
Applying the above well known principle to the facts of this case, we are not persuaded to accept the submission of Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel.	Reasoning
If the submissions were to be accepted and it will have to be held that Election Commission will have no jurisdiction to make an enquiry for the purpose of ascertaining the fulfillment of the requirement as contained in Section 10A then the very provision, namely, Section 10A will have to be rendered otiose.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, not able to accede to the said submission.	Reasoning
On the other hand, if Section 10A has to operate, the conclusion of ours that the Election Commission has the required jurisdiction to make the enquiry into the complaint alleged as against the Appellant is well justified.101.	Reasoning
To the same effect is the decision reported in Afjal Imam v. State of Bihar Ors., 2011(5) SCC 729 which was also relied upon by Ms. Pinki Anand, learned Senior Counsel.	Reasoning
We can also usefully refer to the decision referred to before us by Mr. Ashok Desai, learned Senior Counsel for the Election Commission Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms Anr., 2002(2) R.C.R.(Civil) 640 2002(5) SCC 294, wherein this Court has highlighted the dire need for maintaining purity in the elections and for that purpose Article 324 to be interpreted in a broad perspective, acknowledging the wide powers invested with the Election Commission.	None
Paragraph 17 of the said decision which is relevant for our purpose is as under Ms Kamini Jaiswal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents in support of the decision rendered by the High Court referred to the decision in Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu wherein while considering the validity of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, the Court observed (SCC p. 741, para 179)179 .	Arguments of Respondent
Democracy is a part of the basic structure of our Constitution and rule of law, and free and fair elections are basic features of democracy.	Arguments of Respondent
One of the postulates of free and fair elections is provision for resolution of election disputes as also adjudication of disputes relating to subsequent disqualifications by an independent authority.	Arguments of Respondent
She, therefore, contended that for free and fair elections and for survival of democracy, entire history, background and the antecedents of the candidate are required to be disclosed to the voters so that they can judiciously decide in whose favour they should vote otherwise, there would not be true reflection of electoral mandate.	Arguments of Respondent
For interpreting Article 324, she submitted that this provision outlines broad and general principles giving power to the Election Commission and it should be interpreted in a broad perspective as held by this Court in various decisions.	Arguments of Respondent
In the light of the above categoric statement made while holding that the rule of law and free and fair elections are the basic features and facts of our democracy, Article 324 should be interpreted in a wide perspective giving power to the Election Commission which has to be recognized in a broad sense and not in a narrow one.	Reasoning
We fully approve of the submissions of Mr. Ashok Desai, learned Senior Counsel on the above lines and we have already held that in order to ensure free and fair elections, the power vested with the Election Commission under Section 10A read along with the other provisions of the Act and the Rules, it should be held that Election Commission does possess the requisite powers under Section 10A to hold the necessary enquiry to ascertain the fact about the compliance of the statutory requirements in the matter of submission of accounts of the election expenses, i.e. the true, correct and bona fide expenses and that such expenses were within the prescribed limit of the Act.	Reasoning
We also wish to refer to the decision of this Court reported in Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) Anr.	None
v. Union of India Anr., 2003(4) SCC 399 which was brought to our notice by Mr. Ashok Desai, learned Senior Counsel.	None
In paragraph 20 of the said decision, this Court has practically acknowledged the report of the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution appointed by the Union Government submitted in March, 2002.	None
Paragraph 20 (4.14.1) and (4.14.3) can be usefully referred to show how as a matter of fact money power is playing a very detrimental role in the matter of elections which requires to be curbed, which are as under 204.14.1.	None
One of the most critical problems in the matter of electoral reforms is the hard reality that for contesting an election one needs large amounts of money.	Arguments of Respondent
The limits of expenditure prescribed are meaningless and almost never adhered to.	Arguments of Respondent
As a result, it becomes difficult for the good and the honest to enter legislatures.	Arguments of Respondent
It also creates a high degree of compulsion for corruption in the political arena .	Arguments of Respondent
This has progressively polluted the entire system.	Arguments of Respondent
Corruption, because it erodes performance, becomes one of the leading reasons for non performance and compromised governance in the country.	Arguments of Respondent
The sources of some of the election funds are believed to be unaccounted criminal money in return for protection, unaccounted funds from business groups who expect a high return on this investment, kickbacks or commissions on contracts etc.	Arguments of Respondent
No matter how we look at it, citizens are directly affected because apart from compromised governance, the huge money spent on elections pushes up the cost of everything in the country.	Arguments of Respondent
It also leads to unbridled corruption and the consequences of widespread corruption are even more serious than many imagine.	Arguments of Respondent
Electoral compulsions for funds become the foundation of the whole superstructure of corruption.4.14.3.	Arguments of Respondent
Transparency in the context of election means both the sources of finance as well as their utilization as are listed out in an audited statement.	Arguments of Respondent
If the candidates are required to list the sources of their income, this can be checked back by the Income Tax Authorities.	Arguments of Respondent
The Commission recommends that the political parties as well as individual candidates be made subject to a proper statutory audit of the amounts they spend.	Arguments of Respondent
These accounts should be monitored through a system of checking and crosschecking through the income tax returns filed by the candidates, parties and their wellwishers.	Arguments of Respondent
At the end of the election each candidate should submit an audited statement of expenses under specific heads .	Arguments of Respondent
EC should devise specific formats for filing such statements so that fudging of accounts becomes difficult.	Arguments of Respondent
Also, the audit should not only be mandatory but it should be enforced by the Election Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
We only refer to the said paragraphs as has been relied in the above judgment and keep the same in mind when we interpret the power of the Election Commission under Section 10A.	None
The same will have to be kept in mind when we interpret the power of the Election Commission under Section 10A of the Act.	None
When we do so we are convinced that the interpretation placed by us on Section 10A would be the proper manner of interpretation, in order to ensure that such misuse of money power in the field of public elections are to be curbed.	None
Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned Counsel for the intervenor by relying upon the decision reported in Dalchand Jain (supra) in paragraph 14, pointed out that while Section 123(6), which relates to corrupt practice, is referable to Section 77(3), Section 77(1) and (2) relate to the maintenance of correct accounts with the prescribed particulars, contravention of which, it can be examined only by the Election Commission under Section 10A.	Arguments of Respondent
The said submission is perfectly justified and the reliance placed upon the above decision in paragraph 14 also fully supports the stand of the learned counsel.	Arguments of Respondent
Para 14 reads as under Section 123(6) lays down that the incurring or authorising of expenditure in contravention of Section 77 is a corrupt practice.	Arguments of Respondent
Every contravention of Section 77 does not fall within Section 123(6).	Arguments of Respondent
Section 77 consists of three parts.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 77, subsection (1) requires the candidate to keep a separate and correct account of all election expenses incurred or authorised by him within certain dates.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 77, subsection (2) provides that the account shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 77, subsection (3) requires that the total of the said expenditure shall not exceed the prescribed amount.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 123(6) is related to Section 73(3).	Arguments of Respondent
If the candidate incurs or authorises expenditure in excess of the prescribed amount in contravention of Section 77(3) he commits corrupt practice under Section 123(6).	Arguments of Respondent
The contravention of Section 77, subsections (1) and (2) or the failure to maintain correct accounts with the prescribed particulars does not fall within Section 123(6).	Arguments of Respondent
See Sri Krishna v. Sat Narain.	Arguments of Respondent
The same opinion has been expressed in several decisions of the High Courts, see Savitri Devi v. Prabhawati Misra N.L. Verma v. Muni Lal Narasimhan v. Natesa and the cases referred to therein.	Arguments of Respondent
Relying upon the said paragraph, we are not hesitant to hold that while Section 123(6) is relatable to Section 77(3), there is no bar to invoke Section 77(1) and (2) while holding the enquiry under Section 10A of the Act.	None
While holding so, we do not find any support for the Appellants in relying upon the decision reported in Common Cause (A Registered Society) (supra).	None
Reliance was placed upon paragraph 28(5) and (6).	None
A political party which is not maintaining, audited and authenticated, accounts and has not filed the return of income for the relevant period, cannot, ordinarily, be permitted to say that it has incurred or authorized expenditure in connection with the election of its candidates in terms of Explanation I to Section 77 of the RP Act.6.	Reasoning
That the expenditure, (including that for which the candidate is seeking protection under Explanation 1 to Section 77 of the RP Act) in connection with the election of a candidateto the knowledge of the candidate or his election agentshall be presumed to have been authorised by the candidate or his election agent.	Reasoning
It shall, however, be open to the candidate to rebut the presumption in accordance with law and to show that part of the expenditure or whole of it was in fact incurred by the political party to which he belongs or by any other association or body of persons or by an individual (other than the candidate or his election agent).	Reasoning
Only when the candidate discharges the burden and rebuts the presumption he would be entitled to the benefit of Explanation 1 to Section 77 of the RP Act The submission apparently was that there was every right in the candidate concerned to demonstrate that the candidate did not really incur such expenditure and that he was not to be blamed for any unauthorized expenditure made by the party concerned.	None
Assuming such a stand of any of the Appellants is to be believed, it is always open to the Appellant to demonstrate before the Election Commission, with all the relevant materials and convince the Election Commission that on that score, no order of disqualification can be passed.	None
The said decision cannot however be relied upon to hold that the Election Commission has no power or jurisdiction to enquire into the complaint, which has now been made against the appellant.	None
At the end we can profitably refer to the basics of our democracy, which have been succinctly stated by His Lordship Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer in the Constitution Bench decision reported in Mohinder Singh Gill Anr.	None
v. Chief Election Commission, New Delhi Ors., 1978(1) SCC 405.	Reasoning
To borrow His Lordships expression stated in paragraph 2, the same are as under Every significant case has an unwritten legend and indelible lesson.	Reasoning
This appeal is no exception, whatever its formal result.	Reasoning
The message, as we will see at the end of the decision, relates to the pervasive philosophy of democratic elections which Sir Winston Churchill vivified in matchless words At the bottom of all tributes paid to democracy is the little man, walking into a little booth, with a little pencil, making a little cross on a little bit of paper no amount of rhetoric or voluminous discussion can possibly diminish the overwhelming importance of the point.	Reasoning
If we may add, the little, large Indian shall not be hijacked from the course of free and fair elections by mob muscle methods, or subtle perversion of discretion by men dressed in little, brief authority.	Reasoning
For be you ever so high, the law is above you.	Reasoning
In our considered view, if the above basics of democracy and purity in elections have to be maintained, it is appropriate to hold that the decision of the Election Commission as upheld by the High Court to the effect that Section 10A clothes the Election Commission with the requisite power and authority to enquire into the allegations relating to failure to submit the accounts of election expenses in the manner prescribed and as required by or under the Act, is perfectly justified and we do not find any scope to interfere with the same.	Reasoning
Inasmuch as the period of membership is likely to come to an end, it will be in order for the Election Commission to conclude the proceedings within one month and pass appropriate orders in accordance with law.	Reasoning
In order to ensure that within the said period the Election Commission is not prevented from passing the orders due to non cooperation of any of the parties, it will open for the Election Commission to hold the proceedings on a day to day basis and conclude the same within the said period.	Reasoning
In so far as the appeal ( SLP(C) No. 21958 of 2013) is concerned, apart from holding that the Election Commission has got every jurisdiction to hold the enquiry under Section 10A for the purpose of disqualification, since the Election Commission has already passed its orders on merits and disqualified the Appellant for a period of three years, we also examined the reasoning of the Election Tribunal (High Court) for passing the said order, as well as the judgment of the Division Bench.	Arguments of Respondent
Since, the order of Election Commission has now been confirmed by the Division Bench and since the Division Bench has dealt with the said issue on merits extensively, we wish to refer to the said part of the judgment to find out whether the grievance of the Appellant on merits deserves any consideration.	None
The Division Bench has recorded the plea raised on behalf of the Appellant by stating that according to the Appellant, the advertisements were published by Rashtriya Parivartan Dal and the payment of publication was borne by the party and, therefore, the question to be considered was as to whether the expenses incurred by the party for publishing the advertisement can be held to be expenses incurred or authorized by the Appellant.	None
The Division Bench also took note of the decision of this Court in Common Cause (A Registered Society) (supra), wherein it was held that even if expenses are claimed by the party, the presumption should be that the said expenses shall be incurred or authorized by the candidate, which presumption however is rebuttable.	None
The relevant paragraph of the abovementioned decision on this proposition has been extracted in the earlier part of the judgment.	None
After noting the above settled principle, the Division Bench proceeded to find out whether the said expenses claimed to have been incurred by the party can be treated to be expenses incurred or authorized by the Appellant.	None
