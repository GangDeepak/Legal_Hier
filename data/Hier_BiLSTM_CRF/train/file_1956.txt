16.	None
Mr. Annam D.N. Rao, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that keeping in view of the fact that the respondents herein had accepted their liabilities, it cannot be said that there existed a dispute or dispute by and between the parties within the meaning of Clause 20 of the Memorandum of Understanding dated 8.05.2002.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, as the respondents accepted their liability, pursuant whereto and in furtherance whereof, they issued post dated cheques, a suit for realization of the amount under the said cheques would not attract the provisions of the 1996 Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
17.	None
Mr. Anupam Lal Das, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that in view of the fact that the respondents had paid the balance amount of Rs.	Arguments of Respondent
22,50,000/ by way of two demand drafts dated 18.08.2003 and 12.09.2003, on its own showing, the appellant has no subsisting cause of action and, thus, it should withdraw the suit.	Arguments of Respondent
Difference between Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and Section 8 of the 1996 Act is distinct and apparent.	None
Section 8 of the 1996 Act makes a radical departure from Section 34 of the 1940 Act.	None
The 1996 Act was enacted in the light of UNCITRAL Model Rules.	None
We need not dilate on this issue as this aspect of the matter has been considered by this Court in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited Anr.	Reasoning
v. M s. Verma Transport Company 2006 (7) SCALE 565 , wherein this Court noticed Section 34 of the repealed 1940 Act employs the expression steps in the proceedings.	Reasoning
Only in terms of Section 21 of the 1940 Act, the dispute could be referred to arbitration provided parties thereto agreed.	Reasoning
Under the 1940 Act, the suit was not barred.	Reasoning
The Court would not automatically refer the dispute to an arbitral tribunal.	Reasoning
In the event, it having arrived at satisfaction that there is no sufficient reason that the dispute should not be referred and no step in relation thereto was taken by the applicant, it could stay the suit.	None
Section 8 of the 1996 Act contemplates some departure from Section 34 of the 1940 Act.	None
Whereas Section 34 of the 1940 Act contemplated stay of the suit Section 8 of the 1996 Act mandates a reference.	Reasoning
Exercise of discretion by the judicial authority, which was the hallmark of Section 34 of the 1940 Act, has been taken away under the 1996 Act.	Reasoning
The direction to make reference is not only mandatory, but the arbitration proceedings to be commenced or continued and conclusion thereof by an arbitral award remain unhampered by such pendency.	Reasoning
See O.P. Malhotras	Reasoning

346347 Respondents had not filed any written statement in the suit.	Reasoning
They had not disclosed their defence.	Reasoning
They indisputably had raised a dispute in regard to the claim of the appellant.	Reasoning
We have noticed the arbitration agreement entered into by and between the parties.	Reasoning
It is of wide amplitude.	Reasoning
The arbitration agreement brings within its fold dispute of any nature whatsoever.	Reasoning
It is in broadest term.	Reasoning
Respondents had made payments without prejudice to their rights and contentions.	Reasoning
Payments were made keeping in view the ongoing business relationship between the parties.	Reasoning
Out of the five post dated cheques, two were dishonoured.	Reasoning
But, despite pendency of the suit, payments had been made to satisfy the claim of the appellant in respect of the cheques which were dishonoured.	Reasoning
Sufficient explanation has been offered by the respondents therefor.	Reasoning
Certain contingencies of events, as indicated hereinbefore, are not in dispute.	Reasoning
If the suit was confined to the amount in respect of those two cheques, the contention of Mr. Rao could have been accepted.	Reasoning
But it is not so.	None
The term dispute must be given its general meaning under the 1996 Act.	Reasoning
In P. Ramanatha Aiyars Advanced Law Lexicon, 3rd edition, page 1431, it is stated In the context of an arbitration the words disputes and differences should be given their ordinary meanings.	Reasoning
Because one man could be said to be indisputably right and the other indisputably wrong, that did not necessarily mean that there had never been any dispute between them.	Reasoning
Admittedly, the appellants claim is not confined to the question regarding nonpayment of the amount under the two dishonoured cheques.	Reasoning
Thus, there existed a dispute between the parties.	Reasoning
Had the dispute between the parties been confined thereto only, the same had come to an end.	Reasoning
Appellant evidently has taken before us an inconsistent stand.	Reasoning
If he was satisfied with the payment of the said demand drafts, he need not pursue the suit.	Reasoning
It could have said so explicitly before the High Court.	Reasoning
It cannot, therefore, be permitted to approbate and reprobate.	None
Section 8 of the 1996 Act is peremptory in nature.	Reasoning
In a case where there exists an arbitration agreement, the court is under obligation to refer the parties to arbitration in terms of the arbitration agreement.	Reasoning
See Hindustan Petroleum Corpn.	Reasoning
Ltd. v. Pinkcity Midway Petroleums, (2003) 6 SCC 503 and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (supra)	Reasoning
No issue, therefore, would remain to be decided in a suit.	Reasoning
Existence of arbitration agreement is not disputed.	Reasoning
The High Court, therefore, in our opinion, was right in referring the dispute between the parties to arbitration.	Reasoning
For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in this appeal which is dismissed accordingly with costs.	Decision
