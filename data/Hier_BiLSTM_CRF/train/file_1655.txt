According to the appellants the ingredients of Section 405 are not present.	None
In any event, the plea of the respondent filing the petition mala fide is clearly borne out.14.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that the appellants have not come to this Court with clean hands.15.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellants have introduced a fabricated letter dated 24.6.1995.	None
It is their stand that the entire amount was paid and, therefore, on receiving the full payment, the appellants ought to have returned the cheques which were held only as a collateral security.	None
It is not in dispute that the proceedings under Section 138 are pending.	None
That being so, the question of proceeding for alleged breach of trust does not arise.	None
It is interesting to note that the respondent does not dispute issuance of cheques.	Reasoning
Even a casual reading of the complaint does not show that the ingredients of Section 406 IPC are in any event made out.	Reasoning
It is also not understandable as to how Section 294 has any application to the facts of the case much less Section 506 IPC.	Reasoning
In addition to this, perusal of the complaint apparently shows the ulterior motive.	Reasoning
It is clear that the proceeding initiated by the respondent clearly amounted to abuse of the process of law.	Reasoning
In State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal (AIR 1992 SC 604 ), it was, interalia, observed as follows In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exercised.(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused.(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused.(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a noncognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.	Reasoning
The case at hand falls under category (7).19.	None
Therefore, in view of what has been stated in Bhajan Lals case (supra), the proceedings in ICC 210 of 2000 before learned SDJM, Bhubaneswar stand quashed.	Decision
The appeal is allowed.	Decision
