For the appellants, it was contended that the words no prosecution or suit shall be, instituted against any person in respect of anything done in subs.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2) of s. 26 cover their cases also and they fall within the words , any person.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondents submission on this point was that the two subsections of s. 26 should be read together and the intention of the Legislature was to give protection to Government servants in regard to prosecutions or other legal proceedings.	Arguments of Respondent
That, in our opinion, is not hat the words used in subs.	Reasoning
(2) mean.	Reasoning
, They are words of wider import and would cover cases of all persons including persons other than Government servants.	Reasoning
There are no words restricting the meaning of any person and no reason has been shown why those words should not include the appellants.	None

This opinion is, in our view, not sustainable.	None
When the appellants submitted their returns they did so under s. 10 of the Act and when they produced their accounts they did so under s. 15 of the Act.	Reasoning

The appeals are therefore allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside aid the proceedings in the trial court are quashed.	Decision
