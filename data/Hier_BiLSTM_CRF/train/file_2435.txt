None
The High Court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition filed by the writ petitioner.	Facts
In this case the respondents had entered caveats.	Reasoning
We asked them, even at the stage of preliminary hearing before issuing notice, to address the arguments on the merits or the matter.	Reasoning
Having heard the parties in the case, we have passed this order.	Reasoning
In the writ petition filed before the High Court the petitioner contended (i) that one of the constituents of the second respondent Lenhydro Project is not a company engaged in actual physical execution construction of workers rather, it was only a design firm (ii) the Intertech Service is not a Construction Company engaged having experience in actual execution construction of concrete Dam, Spillway and Power House Works (iii)	Arguments of Petitioner
The statement made by the authorised signatory of the Lenhydro Project that the said constituent has executed the Bureya Hydroelectric Project, far east Russia is not correct as in fact the said project has been built by JSC Buguchangesstroy as turn key contractor.	Arguments of Petitioner
4.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of this contention, the learned counsel for petitioner relied upon a letter issued by the SHC Institute Hydro Projects and letter dated May 25, 2002 by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russia Federation which stated that LENGIBROPROYEKT is a specialized design engineering company in the filed of hydroelectric projects where it enjoys goods standing as a design firm.	Arguments of Petitioner
This firm does not involve itself in executing projects nor is it known to associate or act as a turnkey contractor that letter dated 22.11.1999 Annexure P/12 issued by the Bureya Hydro Power Project is ambiguous inasmuch as it only refers to successful completion of the contract by the Russian constituent of the second respondent without any details thereto that the Bureya Hydro Power Project on Bureya River was, in fact, constructed by Boguchangesstroy as a turnkey contractor as per the information obtained from the Reference list of the Project built by the JSC Boguchangesstroy for the years 19972000.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also contended that during the period from 1993 to 1997 the Lenhydro project merely got executed construction work project at the Bureya Hydro Power Station even as per certificate dated 15th July, 2002 issued by the Chief Engineer of the Parent Company of the Russian Constituent of the 2nd respondent.	Arguments of Petitioner
On this basis it is contended that the second respondent had not placed any satisfactory material to show that it had necessary experience as required under the prequalification documents.	Arguments of Petitioner
The letters issued by the SHC Institute Hydro Projects and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation do not specifically deal with whether the 2nd respondent had in fact executed the construction work of Bureya HydroPower Station project but makes general reference.	Reasoning
The Reference List obtained from the Internet gives information from 1997 onwards and not for the earlier period.	Reasoning
Therefore, these three documents are not helpful to the petitioner.	Reasoning
The stand of the respondents is that Bureya HydroPower Station project is a multistage project that during period 19931997, the Russian Constituent of the 2nd respondent was entrusted with the construction, technical support and quality control of Bureya HydroPower Station project and they were providing construction machinery, material, manpower etc.	Reasoning
during the execution of works.	Reasoning
Certificate issued on 1.8.2002 in this regard by the parent company is made available by the 2nd respondent.	Reasoning
Another certificate dated June 11, 2002 was relied upon along with the letter dated 22.11.1999 issued in this regard.	Reasoning
Next stage of project from 1998 onwards was executed by a subcontractor JSC Boguchangesstroy and Boguchangesstroy had not figured for the earlier period prior to 1998.	Reasoning
This project has nothing to do with the earlier project.	Reasoning
The clear stand of the respondents on the basis of these documents is that apart from general designing work they were also engaged in actual construction of the project.	Reasoning
If upon the material made available to the 1st respondent by the 2nd respondent its prequalification has been decided, the High Court in justified in not interfering under Article 226 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
In the light of this position, we find no merit in this petition and the same stands dismissed.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
