The observations of Justice D K Jain, contained in his order dated 6 September 2019, in respect of the Concession Agreement dated 9 December 2009, were produced before the High Court, which were as follows Nevertheless, Clause 24.6 of Article 24 stipulates that upon termination of the Concession Contract, for any reason whatsoever HUDA shall take possession and control of Metro link forthwith, including the material, construction plan, implements, equipment, etc., on or about, the site.	Facts
Therefore, except for the stipulation of a prior 90 days notice in writing to HUDA by the Concessionaire for termination of the Concession Contract, where after such termination takes effect, upon termination of the Concession Contract by either of the Parties, HUDA is, obliged to take possession of the Metro link forthwith.	Facts
I am inclined to agree with the Ld.	Facts
Counsel appearing for RMGL that requirement of the said prior notice is to enable HUDA to prepare itself to take over the possession and control of the Metro link.	Facts
In that view of the matter, the Notice of termination of the Concession Contract having been served by RMGL on HSVP (earlier known as HUDA), in writing on June 7, 2019, the said termination notice takes effect on the expiry of the 90 days therefrom i.e. September 8, 2019 and RMGL is required to handover the possession and control of the subject Metro link to HSVP on or before, September 9, 2019 and HSVP is obliged to take possession and control of the Metro link forthwith.	Facts
There is no explanation as why HSVP did not take any steps to ensure smooth handing and taking over of the project by RMGL to HSVP, all this while.	Facts
In so far as the question of validity of the termination notice issued by RMGL to HSVP is concerned, the issue is to be decided at an appropriate forum and not by the undersigned in terms of the aforeextracted direction by the Honble NCLAT.	Facts
The observations of Justice D K Jain in respect of the Concession Agreement dated 3 January 2013 were as follows It is evident that both the parties are adidem that both the parties having issued notices for terminating the Agreement, the metro link has to be taken over by HSVP HMRTC but the dispute is only with regard to the time when the handing over and taking over after the same should take place.	Facts
No explanation whatsoever is forthcoming as to why, on the receipt of Termination Notice dated June 7, 2019, HSVP HMRTC did not take any steps to ensure smooth handing over of the project by RMGSL to them, all this while.	Facts
In so far as the question of validity of the termination notice issued RMGSL to HSVP is concerned, the issue is to be decided at an appropriate forum and not by the undersigned in terms of the aforeextracted direction by the Honble NCLAT.	Facts
Accordingly, RMGSL is permitted to handover the possession and control of Metro link from Delhi Metro Sikanderpur Station on MG Road to Sector 56, Gurugram to ASVP, pursuant to the termination of the Concession Agreement dated January 3, 2013.	Facts
It goes without saying that this permission is without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the contesting parties to take recourse to appropriate legal proceedings to assail the validity and consequences of termination of the Concession Agreement by both of them.	Facts

Arguments of Respondent
CAG was to hence examine the scope of the audit of the debt due suggested by HSVP in terms of the Concession Agreements	Arguments of Respondent
The reports submitted by the auditors appointed by CAG indicate that the audit was limited in nature, confined to ascertaining the debt due under the Concession Agreements.	Arguments of Respondent
On the other hand, the conclusions in the audit reports would demonstrate that other matters had come to the attention of the auditors which could have significant impact on the debt due The detailed objections filed by HMRTC would indicate that the audit is incomplete and incomprehensive and Since the proceedings are pending before the High Court, there is no reason for the appellants to move this Court, and the objections raised by HMRTC to the audit reports would have to be determined on their merit.	None
Mr Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Canara Bank and Andhra Bank, submitted that on the request of RMGSL, the consortium led by Canara Bank provided facilities in aggregate of Rs 1,500 crores in the form of a Rupee Term Loan Facility under a Common Loan Agreement dated 26 March 2013.	Arguments of Respondent
Thereafter, RMGSL also availed the External Commercial Borrower as well as Derivate Facility.	Arguments of Respondent

No 2.	Arguments of Respondent
The lenders had filed a reply before Justice D K Jain stating that they had no objection of the handing over of the assets to HMRTC, subject to the deposit of the amount due to the lenders in an Escrow Account.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, the debt due having now been determined in terms of the audit report, it has to be deposited in the Escrow Account maintained by Canara Bank.	Arguments of Respondent

It has been submitted that the amount, upon deposit in Escrow Accounts, will be in the hands of the nationalized banks which have financed the Projects.	Arguments of Respondent
The rival submissions will now be considered.	None

Article 24.5.2 provides for the consequences of termination by the concessionaire, due to a default by HUDA 24.5.2	Reasoning
Upon Termination by the Concessionaire on account of an HUDA Event of Default, HUDA shall take over the complete system (all Project Assets) and the Concessionaire shalt be entitled to receive from HUDA by way of Termination Payment a sum equal to Debt due (b) 110 of the Adjusted Equity Accordingly, where the Concession Agreement has been terminated by HUDA on account of a default by the concessionaire, HUDA was required to take over the complete project and assets, and to pay to the lenders of the Project, as per the financing documents, an amount equal to 80 per cent of the debt due as termination payment.	Reasoning
Where on the other hand, the termination is by the concessionaire on account of a default by HUDA, the concessionaire was entitled to receive by way of a termination payment, a sum equal to The debt due and (b) 110 per cent of the adjusted equity.	Reasoning
Article 24.7 which provides for the termination payments reads as follows 24.7 Termination Payments	None

Facts
On 6 December 2018, an FIR No 253 was registered by the Economic Offences Wing.	None
As pointed out by the Solicitor General, RMGL and RMGSL were named as accused nos 21 and 22 in the FIR, the allegation being in respect of the procuring of fake invoices, as a result of which the cost of projects implemented were alleged to be higher than those implemented by DMRC, resulting in the rapid metro link projects at Gurgaon incurring losses.	None
RMGL and RMGSL, which belong to the ILFS group of companies, were thus classified as red entities.	None
On 4 February 2019, Justice D K Jain was appointed by the NCLT to supervise the resolution process for the ILFS group.	None
On 7 June 2019, RMGL issued a notice for the termination of the Concession Agreement dated 9 December 2009 to HSVP under Article 24.5.1, with the period of notice being 90 days.	Facts
A similar notice of termination was issued by RMGSL in terms of Article 32.5.1 of Concession Agreement dated 3 January 2013.	Facts
RMGL and RMGSL addressed communications on 1 August 2019 to HSVP for completing the handover of the rapid metro link Projects.	None
On 26 August 2019, HMRTC issued a notice of termination to RMGL in terms of the Articles 24.1 and 24.2 of the Concession Agreement dated 9 December 2009.	Facts
A similar notice was issued to RMGSL.	None
In the interim, Justice D K Jain was moved by RMGL and RMSL to grant his approval to the handing over of possession of the rapid metro link Projects.	None
By his order dated 6 September 2019, Justice D K Jain permitted RMGL and RMGSL to handover possession and control of the rapid metro link Projects to HSVP on or before 9 September 2019.	None
HMRTC and HSVP then moved the High Court in writ proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution seeking Writ of certiorari for quashing the notices of termination dated 7 June 2019, on the ground that there was no permission of the competent authority appointed by the NCLAT, and that it was against the public interest because the rapid metro project of Gurgaon, which was operational since 2013, would come to a halt on 8 September 2019 and A writ of mandamus directing that the notice period of 90 days would commence only from the grant of the permission by the NCLAT.	Reasoning
Taking note of the order passed by Justice D K Jain, the High Court by its order dated 6 September 2019 directed RMGL and RMGSL to continue the operation of the rapid metro rail till the midnight of 9 September 2019.	Facts
On 9 September 2019, the High Court observed that the dispute between the parties would have to be resolved by negotiations, and hence the order of stay, under which the rapid metro rail projects were to be continued in operation by RMGL and RMGSL, was continued till midnight of 17 September 2019.	Facts
From the order of the High Court dated 9 September 2019, it is evident that RMGL and RMGSL, while referring to the terms of the proposed discussion which HMRTC HSVP, catalogued inter alia A time bound handover of the project to HSVP and corresponding commitment for taking it over by HSVP and A commitment to pay at least 80 per cent of the debt due as termination payment to RMGL and RMGSL by HSVP.	None
On 18 September 2019, the appellants proposed that they would continue to operate the metro link Projects until 16 October 2019, during which period the debt due under the financing documents, in terms of the Concession Agreements, may be determined by an auditor to be appointed by the High Court.	None
Further, the process for transfer of the rapid metro link Projects was to be supervised by two former judges of the High Court.	None
Both the appellants specifically stated that this proposal was subject to the condition that once the debt due is determined, HSVP must deposit 80 per cent of the debt due as determined in an Escrow Account in terms of the Concession Agreement, Escrow Agreement and Substitution Agreement.	Facts
This proposal, it was clarified, was made to safeguard the interest of the public sector lenders of the Projects.	None
Responding to the above proposal of the appellants, HMRTC and HSVP specifically stated in their written responses that An agreement had been entered into with DMRC on 16 September 2019 for operation and maintenance of the rapid metro lines As regards the ascertainment of the debt due, this was linked to the definition of the expression under Concession Agreements HMRTC HSVP agreed with the proposal of RMGL RMGSL that an auditor may be appointed to ascertain the actual figures, and stated that the CAG may be entrusted with the assignment to ascertain financial aspects and determining the over invoicing of the Projects and The deposit of 80 per cent of the debt due as determined in an Escrow Account would depend on the outcome of the report of the auditor, and HMRTC and HSVP commit and confirm to adhere to the directions as would be passed by the Honble High Court or NCLAT or any other Court or any other order under any other legal proceedings passed by any other competent authority in terms of the Concession Agreements.	None
The above course of events indicates that the entire order which was passed by the High Court on 20 September 2019 was the outcome of sustained negotiations which took place between RMGL and RMGSL on the one hand, and HMRTC and HSVP on the other, commencing from the invocation of the writ jurisdiction under Article 226.	Reasoning
Now, it is significant to note that recourse to the proceedings under Article 226 was taken by HMRTC HSVP, which challenged the termination notice and sought the continuation of the operation of the rapid metro lines at Gurgaon, which were under imminent threat of closure, once the notice period expired on 8 September 2019.	Reasoning
The narration of events would make it abundantly clear that initially as a result of the order of stay granted by the High Court on 6 September 2019, and thereafter consequent upon mutual discussions, RMGL RMGSL agreed to operate the rapid metro link Projects until 16 October 2019, within which period the handover to DMRC would take place.	Reasoning
Equally, the concerns by RMGL RMGSL, as concessionaires, was that in terms of the Concession Agreements, 80 per cent of the debt due had to be deposited in the Escrow Account in terms of the provisions contained in Article 24.4 in Concession Agreement dated 9 December 2009.	Reasoning
All the parties specifically agreed before the High Court that there would be a reference to the CAG for conducting an audit for the purpose of determining the debt due.	Reasoning
The High Court by its order dated 20 September 2019, issued directions which were specifically noted to be emanating from the consensusarrived at in the presence of senior officers of both the parties namely Mr D Suresh, IAS, Managing Director, HMRTC, Chief Administrator, HSVP, Mr Rajiv Banga, Managing Director, RMGL and Director, RMGSL.	Reasoning
The consensual order passed by the High Court envisaged that RMGL and RMGSL would continue to operate the rapid metro lines for 30 days from 16 September 2019	Facts
The transfer of the rapid metro lines would be overseen by two former judges of the High Court	None
The debt due as defined under the Concession Agreements would be determined under the auspices of the CAG who would appoint a team of auditors for the financial audit of the debt due and for examining the scope of the audit of the debt due audited by the HSVP with the assistance of the auditors appointed by the parties to the lis The process of audit would be completed within 30 days, and 80 per cent of the debt due determined by the audit report shall be deposited by HSVP in an Escrow account, which would be subject to the orders of the NCLAT or any other competent statutory authority, within a period of 30 days of the receipt of the report and The rest of the disputes between the parties arising out the audit report, would be agitated and decided in arbitration proceedings, which was a mode already provided in the Concession Agreements.	Arguments of Petitioner
Clause (ii) of the directions contained in the High Courts consent order dated 20 September 2019 makes it abundantly clear that the audit team appointed by CAG was to conduct a financial audit of the debt due and to examine the scope of the audit.	Reasoning
The next important aspect of the consent order is the time bound process which was envisaged, with the audit being completed within 30 days and 80 per cent of the debt due being deposited within 30 days after the receipt of the audit report.	Reasoning
The final aspect which needs to be emphasized is that the rest of the disputes between the parties arising out of the audit report were to be agitated in arbitration.	Reasoning
This would leave no manner of doubt that parties clearly understood that once the debt due was ascertained in terms of the audit report, 80 per cent would be deposited by HSVP in the Escrow Account while the rest of the disputes in respect of the audit report would be governed by arbitration.	Reasoning
A time of 30 days was envisaged for deposit the amount in Escrow Account, upon the receipt of the audit report.	Reasoning
Subsequent to the order dated 20 September 2019, another order was passed by the High Court on 4 October 2019.	Reasoning
Clause (ii) of the earlier order was substituted.	Reasoning
As substituted, it was envisaged that the auditors would also have to examine the scope of the audit of the debt due suggested by HSVP.	Reasoning
Hence, CAG would also examine the scope of the audit of the debt due suggested by HSVP in terms of the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
Moreover, it was envisaged that the rest of the dispute either arising out of the CAG report, the validity of the termination notices issued by both the parties and any past or future claims liabilities inter se would be agitated in arbitration.	Reasoning
On 15 October 2019, there was a further clarification by the Division Bench that CAG would examine the scope of the audit of the debt due suggested by both the parties in terms of the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
Thus, it was understood by both the parties that the determination of the debt due would be in terms of the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
CAG specifically placed before the High Court its understanding of the role to be performed by it.	Reasoning
In its written statement before the High Court on 19 November 2019, CAG stated that it had decided to appoint an auditor for the financial audit of debt due as on the transfer date.	Reasoning
The terms as envisaged define the scope of the work of the auditor to be Verification of the debt due with reference to the terms and conditions of the Concession Agreements and all financing agreements documents which have a bearing on the computation of the debt due Verification that all funds constituting the financial package both debt and equity, for meeting the capital cost had been credited and received in the Escrow Account Verification that the funds of the financial package were used for the project assets as defined in the Concession Agreements and their impact on the debt due Verification that all nonfare revenues were duly accounted and that all fare revenues were deposited in the Escrow Account Verification that the amounts standing to the credit in the Escrow Account had been appropriated in the order prescribed in the Escrow Agreement Verification that all other receipts and payments were routed through the Escrow Account, together with the review of all other bank accounts maintained operated by the appellants and Information in the annual reports of the appellants was arrived at by following the applicable standards and guidelines.	Reasoning
Obligations of HMRTC and HSVP to pay the debt due HMRTC and HSVP, as well as the appellants, were apprised at all material times of the work of audit being handed over by CAG to a firm appointed by it.	Reasoning
On 24 February 2020, a draft report of the financial audit of the debt due of RMGL RMGSL was sent to the Principal Secretary to the Government of Haryana in the Department of Town and Country Planning.	Reasoning
HMRTC was requested to communicate its response on behalf of the State government, so that it could be incorporated in the report.	Reasoning
On 27 February 2020, HSVP sought four weeks at the least, in view of the ongoing Session of the State Legislative Assembly.	Reasoning
The Accountant General Audit, Haryana followed up the earlier email by subsequent communications dated 18 March 2020 and 22 April 2020.	Reasoning
By the later communication on behalf of CAG, the response of the State government was requested to be furnished before the deadline of 29 April 2020, failing which the report would be finalized without including their response.	Reasoning
HMRTC, HSVP and the State government, however, did not furnish their response to the draft report.	Reasoning
Eventually, the audit reports were finalised in respect of the debt due under the Concession Agreements with RMGL RMGSL respectively, and were placed before the High Court in sealed cover.	Reasoning
Following the opening of the sealed cover on an application by the appellants, an objection was raised in the form of an affidavit by HMRTC on 10 October 2020, as noticed in the earlier part of this judgment.	Reasoning
According to HMRTC, the audit report was inconclusive and incomplete, since several aspects which will have an impact on the debt due remain to be determined.	Reasoning
Now, at this stage, it is necessary to note that the auditors stated that the scope of the audit as decided by CAG was submitted to the High Court on 19 November 2019, and it was intimated that only those issues which are relevant and related to examining the debt due under the Concession Agreements would be examined.	Reasoning
Hence, other issues mentioned by HMRTC, such as encumbrances and liabilities on the metro project, shareholding share in the valuation of the assets of the concessionaire, change of shareholding rights, criminal acts and liabilities, would require forensic and technical audit.	Reasoning
It is important to note that such audits are ongoing independently.	Reasoning
The audit conducted by the auditors appointed by the CAG herein, was limited to examining the debt due as defined in the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
While arriving at the principal and interest component of the debt due, the auditors indicated that other matters had come to their attention, which can have a significant impact on the debt due, and that the report was subject to the outcome of such matters.	Reasoning
These included An entity specific forensic audit which is conducted by the lenders The order passed by NCLT on 1 January 2019 for reopening and recasting the accounts of ILFS and two of its subsidiaries (INTL and IFIM)	Reasoning
The initiation by the new Board in January 2019 of thirdparty forensic examination for the period between April 2013 to September 2018 in relation to certain companies of the group and The subcontracting by IRL of nine packages to various related and unrelated parties including companies, with irregularities pointed in a notice to show cause issued by the Income Tax department on 15 November 2018.	None
Indeed, the submission of the learned Solicitor General that the audit under the auspices of the CAG is incomplete and inconclusive is based on the above statements contained in the audit report noticing other matters which may have a bearing on the debt due.	None
Now the issue before the Court in this backdrop is whether the consequences envisaged in the consent order of the High Court dated 20 September 2019 can stand obviated on the above grounds.	Issue
At the very outset, it is important to note that the FIR in respect of ILFS group of companies was lodged on 6 December 2018.	Reasoning
The termination notices of June and August 2019, and the institution of the writ proceedings, took place thereafter.	Reasoning
Evidently the appellants on the one hand, as well as HSVP HMRTC on the other, were conscious of the developments which were taking place in respect of the ILFS group of companies in the proceedings before Justice D K Jain on 19 August 2019.	Reasoning
When the consent order was passed before the High Court, HSVP was represented by counsel as well as the Chief Administrator of HSVP and Managing Director of HMRTC who were also present.	Reasoning
The financial institutions including Andhra Bank were also in appearance.	Reasoning
The consent order before the High Court on 20 September 2019 was also preceded by mutual discussions between the parties and the exchange of written proposals.	Reasoning
which have been referred to expressly by the High Court.	Reasoning
The consent order of the High Court envisages The manner in which the expression debt due would be determined The manner in which the scope of the audit report would be prescribed and The consequence of the determination by the auditors to be appointed by the CAG.	Reasoning
Clause (ii) of the order dated 20 September 2019 makes it abundantly clear that the basic purpose underlying the entrustment of the reference to the CAG was the determination of the debt due as defined under the Concession Contract.	Reasoning
The High Court, it must be emphasized, was seized of a proceeding under Article 226 of the Constitution, and its writ jurisdiction had been invoked to challenge the notices of termination issued by RMGL and RMGSL, and for ensuring that the consequence which would emanate on the expiry of the notice period of 90 days by the cessation of the metro operations could be prevented by the judicial intervention in the course of the public law jurisdiction.	Reasoning
The issuance of a notice of termination, the consequences which would ensue, and the resolution of disputes is specifically provided in the arbitration agreement between the parties, which is an intrinsic part of the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
Hence, there was an evident interface between this element of public interest on the one hand and the contractual rights of the parties to the Concession Agreements on the other.	Reasoning
However, when HMRTC and HSVP moved the High Court under Article 226, they did so in view of the impending threat which was looming large on the horizon of the rapid metro operations being brought to a standstill as a result of the proximate expiry of the notice of 90 days preceding termination.	Reasoning
In Sanjana M. Wig vs Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (2005) 8 SCC 242 , a two judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Justice S B Sinha, has observed The principal question which arises for consideration is as to whether a discretionary jurisdiction would be refused to be exercised solely on the ground of existence of an alternative remedy which is more efficacious However, access to justice by way of public law remedy would not be denied when a lis involves public law character and when the forum chosen by the parties would not be in a position to grant appropriate relief.	None
It may be true that in a given case when an action of the party is dehors the terms and conditions contained in an agreement as also beyond the scope and ambit of the domestic forum created therefor, the writ petition may be held to be maintainable but indisputably therefor such a case has to be made out.	Reasoning
It may also be true, as has been held by this Court in Amritsar Gas Service (1991) 1 SCC 533 and E. Venkatakrishna (2000) 7 SCC 764 that the arbitrator may not have the requisite jurisdiction to direct restoration of distributorship having regard to the provisions contained in Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 but while entertaining a writ petition even in such a case, the court may not lose sight of the fact that if a serious disputed question of fact is involved arising out of a contract qua contract, ordinarily a writ petition would not be entertained.	Reasoning
A writ petition, however, will be entertained when it involves a public law character or involves a question arising out of public law functions on the part of the respondent.	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied)	None
In the present case, the High Court was evidently concerned over a fundamental issue of public interest, which was the hardship that would be caused to commuters who use the rapid metro as a vehicle for mass transport in Gurgaon.	Reasoning
As such, the High Courts exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 in the present case was justified since noninterference, which would have inevitably led to the disruption of rapid metro lines for Gurgaon, would have had disastrous consequences for the general public.	Reasoning
However, as a measure of abundant caution, we clarify that ordinarily the High Court in its jurisdiction under Article 226 would decline to entertain a dispute which is arbitrable Bisra Lime Stone Co. Ltd. vs Orissa SEB, (1976) 2 SCC 167.	Reasoning
Moreover, remedies are available under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for seeking interim directions either under Section 9 before the Court vested with jurisdiction or under Section 17 before the Arbitral Tribunal itself.	Reasoning
It is also important to note that the termination of the Concession Agreements had consequences in terms of the provisions contained in the Agreement requiring a deposit of 80 per cent of the debt due under Article 24.4.	Reasoning
The contesting parties agreed to an independent thirdparty determination of this amount by a neutral entity, namely the CAG.	Reasoning
The primary function of CAG was to appoint a team of auditors for conducting a financial audit of the debt due and in that process of also examine the scope of the audit.	Reasoning
The orders dated 4 October 2019 and 15 October 2019 issued by the High Court also envisaged that CAG would examine the scope of the audit.	Reasoning
While the earlier order of 4 October 2019 required CAG to examine the scope of the audit of the debt due suggested by HSVP, the subsequent order dated 15 October 2019 required the examination by CAG on the scope of the audit after bearing in mind the suggestions by both the parties in terms of the Concession Agreement.	Reasoning
The expression in terms of the Concession Agreement indicates that the basis of the audit was to be what was envisaged in the Concession Agreements, which specifically defines the expression debt due.	Reasoning
Pertinently, the original order of 20 September 2019 specifies a strict time schedule within which, on a determination being made by the auditor, 80 per cent of the debt due would be deposited by HSVP in the Escrow Account.	Reasoning
This was however subject to the safeguard that it would be subject to any order that may be passed by NCLAT or by a competent statutory authority.	Reasoning
However, it was further clarified that the rest of the disputes between the parties to the lis arising out of the audit report were to be agitated in arbitration proceedings.	Reasoning
This provision, which is embodied in clause (v) of the operative directions of the High Courts consent order dated 20 September 2019, is capable of a reasonable interpretation that once a determination was made in the audit report, 80 per cent would be deposited in the Escrow Account by HSVP and if any dispute arising out of the audit report remained, that would be resolved in arbitration.	Reasoning
As a matter of fact, the subsequent order of 4 October 2019 replaced clause (v) by envisaging that the rest of the disputes between the parties arising out of the CAG report the validity of the termination notices issued by both the parties and any past or future inter se claims liabilities shall be agitated and decided in arbitration proceedings.	Reasoning
HSVP and HMRTC on the one hand, and RMGL RMGSL on the other, were in discussion at arms length when they invited the High Court to pass its order dated 20 September 2019, and agreed to the modifications which have been made by the orders dated 4 October 2019 and 15 October 2019.	Reasoning
A two judge Bench of this Court, speaking through Justice Ruma Pal, in Manish Mohan Sharma vs Ram Bahadur Thakur Limited (2006) 4 SCC 416 has observed 28A consent decree has been held to be a contract with the imprimatur of the Court superadded.	Reasoning
It is something more than a mere contract and has the elements of both a command and a contract.	Reasoning
(See Wentworth v. Bullen 141 ELR 769 C.F. Angadi v. Y.S. Hirannayya 1972 2 SCR 515 ).	Reasoning
As was said by the Privy Council as early as 1929, The only difference in this respect between an order made by consent and one not so made is that the first stands unless and until it is discharged by mutual agreement or is set aside by another order of the Court the second stands until and unless it is discharged on an appeal (See Charles Hubert Kinch v. Edward Keith Walcott and Ors.).	None
In the face of the clear stipulations contained in the order of the High Court, it would be impermissible to interdict the consequences emanating from the working out of the directions contained in the above orders of the High Court upon the submission of the CAG report.	None
CAG in the course of its affidavit filed before this Court and High Court by the Deputy Accountant General Shri KSN Prasad, IAS and AS (Deputy General (Administration), has clarified that it was decided, after examining the scope of the financial audit of the debt due suggested by both the parties, that CAG would examine only those issues which are related and relevant to examining the debt due under the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
CAG followed a process which is fair by making a statement on the scope of the audit before the High Court in advance examining the scope of the audit as suggested by the parties before making its determination appointing a firm of chartered accountants for conducting an audit as was envisaged in the order of the High Court furnishing the contesting parities with a copy of the draft report allowing the parties to submit their response to the draft report granting an extension of time to the State of Haryana to submit its comments and placing the State on notice that it would have to file its objections finally by a prescribed deadline, failing which the report would be finalized.	Reasoning
HMRTC and HSVP are themselves to blame if they did not submit their responses.	Reasoning
CAG has specifically rebutted the objections to the audit report submitted by HMRTC on the ground that as a constitutional authority, CAG decided upon the scope of the audit of the debt in terms of the Concession Agreements, which it submitted to the High Court.	Reasoning
Moreover, it has clarified that this was a financial audit of the debt due and the auditors reported their findings in terms of the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
The FIR lodged by the Economic Offences Wing, the Income Tax Department notice, investigation by the SFIO and Forensic Audit did not form a part of the financial audit conducted by the CAG.	Reasoning
CAG has submitted that a financial audit of the debt due is complete and conclusive under the scope of audit as decided by CAG, and submitted to the High Court.	Reasoning
It is pertinent to remember that the Projects in question have been funded by a consortium led by banks, among which are Canara Bank and Andhra Bank.	Reasoning
The terms of the Concession Agreements expressly recognized that the Projects were being publicly funded through financial institutions.	Reasoning
The audit report emphasized that the proportion between debt and equity was pegged at 7030.	Reasoning
The terms of the Concession Agreement dated 9 December 2009 clearly envisaged the purpose of the Escrow Account in Article 18.	Reasoning
HUDA, the predecessor of HSVP, entered into a Concession Agreement dated 9 December 2009, which in Article 17 expressly recognizes the linkage between the financing package and the Concession Agreement.	Reasoning
In fact, Article 17.2 emphasizes that the rights of the concessionaire would stand waived if financial closure was not to occur within six months within the cure period of six months.	Reasoning
Further, Article 18.1 envisages that all funds constituting the financing package for meeting the concessionaires capital cost shall be credited to the Escrow Account during the period of operations, and all fare and nonfare revenues collected by the concessionaire shall be exclusively deposited in it.	Reasoning
Under Article 18.2, the concessionaire was required to give to the Escrow bank irrevocable instructions while opening the Escrow Account that the deposits into the Escrow Account would be appropriated in the manner indicated in clauses (i) to (ii) of Article 18.2.1.	Reasoning
This includes provision for debt service payments.	Reasoning
These provisions in the Concession Agreement have a vital bearing on the subject matter of the present dispute.	Reasoning
Canara Bank in its affidavit filed before the High Court has stated that on behalf of consortium of lenders, acting as facility agent, it financed RMGSL in the Account Agreement has been entered into in pursuance of the Concession Agreement, and to effectuate the funding of the Project No 2.	Reasoning
As on 31 July 2019, the lenders of RMGSL have an outstanding of Rs 1651 crores approx.	Reasoning
Hence, the Projects which have been executed by RMGL and RMGSL, involved an outlay of funds from Andhra Bank and Canara Bank, who have a vital stake in the financials of the Projects.	Reasoning
As such, HMRTC and HSVP cannot avoid at this stage complying with the directions which were issued by the High Court in its orders dated 20 September 2019, as modified on 4 and 15 October 2019, on the plea that an FIR has been lodged on 16 December 2018 against ILFS group in which there are allegations against RMGL and RMGSL of producing fake invoices and inflating the capital cost of the rapid metro Projects.	Reasoning
The circumstances which have been adverted to in the affidavit filed by HMRTC in the High Court were known to it and to HSVP, when they both agreed to an order which emanated with the consent of the parties on 20 September 2019.	Reasoning
Both HMRTC and HSVP were conscious of their obligation to deposit 80 per cent of the debt due as a consequence of the termination by the provisions contained in the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
They wished to lend an assurance to the determination of the debt due by seeking the involvement of the CAG.	Reasoning
They made a solemn commitment before the High Court that within 30 days of the determination, 80 per cent of the debt due would be deposited in an Escrow Account.	Reasoning
This amount, it must be emphasized, is not being handed over either to RMGL or RMGSL, which have been classified as red entities of the ILFS group.	Reasoning
The placement of the quantum representing 80 per cent of the debt due in Escrow Account is to abide by such directions as may be issued by NCLAT or any other competent statutory authority.	Reasoning
Besides this provision, remedies are available either before the competent Court under Section 9 or before the Arbitral tribunal under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.	Reasoning
Hence, there being an agreement between the parties, to permit HSVP and HMRTC to obstruct or delay compliance with their obligations would be manifestly impermissible for three reasons Firstly, the obligation to deposit 80 per cent debt due as a consequence of the termination emanates from Article 24.4 of the Concession Agreement dated 9 December 2009 Secondly, the obligation to deposit 80 per cent of the debt due as determined in the report of the auditor has been assumed voluntarily before the High Court by HSVP HMRTC from which, as public bodies, they cannot be permitted to resile and Thirdly, there is a vital public interest element in ensuring that the monies which are committed by banks and financial institutions towards financing infrastructure projects are secured to them in terms of the Concession Agreements.	Reasoning
The underlying wrongdoing which was allegedly conducted by the promoters in the erstwhile management of ILFS undoubtedly needs to be investigated.	Reasoning
The process of pursuing the forensic audit, the investigation by the SFIO and by the law enforcement machinery must follow to its logical conclusion.	Reasoning
The NCLT is supervising the resolution process with a government appointed Board now being in charge of the management of ILFS.	Reasoning
Equally, financing arrangements entered into by financial institutions towards fulfilling infrastructure projects, based on the sanctity of the commercial contracts, are to be duly observed.	Reasoning
This facet has to be emphasized since it embodies a vital element of public interest as well.	Reasoning
Commentators have noted that, deterioration in loan recovery not only leads to higher provisions and diminished profitability but also constrains banks lending capacity, thus affecting the economy	Reasoning
adversely(Rekha Mishra, Rajmal and Radheshyam Verma, Determinants of Recovery of Stressed Assets in India An Empirical Study.	Reasoning

Unless the dues which are assured to financial institutions as part of the arrangements which are envisaged in Concession Agreements are duly enforced, the structure of financing for infrastructure projects may well be in jeopardy.	Reasoning
Such a consequence must be avoided by declining to accede to a request, such as that by HMRTC and HSVP, which is to allow it to resile from its obligations.	Reasoning
These obligations arise not only in terms of the Concession Agreements, but have been solemnly assumed before the High Court.	Reasoning
Hence, on both counts, HMRTC and HSVP cannot be permitted to resile.	Reasoning
The intervention of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution was sought having regard to the manner in which the proceedings before the High Court were being derailed.	Reasoning
On 12 October 2020, after HMRTC filed its affidavit, the High Court noted the appellants submission that the matter does not brook any delay and yet adjourned the matter to 16 October 2020.	Reasoning
Thereafter, when the proceedings came up on 16 December 2020, and the response filed by CAG was taken on the record, the hearing of the writ petitions was again deferred to 8 April 2021.	Reasoning
This course of events indicates that the whole object and purpose behind setting down the timelines in the order dated 20 September 2019 stood the risk of being defeated.	Reasoning
This Court has been constrained to intervene in the process in order to ensure that the sanctity of the understanding that was arrived at before the High Court on 20 September 2019 is duly maintained.	Reasoning
As we have already observed earlier, there is a vital public interest element in ensuring that monies which are liable to be deposited in the Escrow Account with a nationalised bank are duly deposited.	Reasoning
HMRTC and HSVP, it must be emphasized, are not left without remedy.	Reasoning
The deposit into the Escrow Account has to be maintained in that form and will abide by such orders that may be passed by NCLAT or by a competent statutory authority.	Reasoning
Besides this, the Concession Agreements provides a clearcut remedy for seeking reliefs under the arbitration agreement.	Reasoning
As noted earlier, the invocation of the writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution by HMRTC and HSVP was to challenge the termination notices dated 17 June 2019, and to obviate the consequence of the cessation of the rapid metro operations, which would have ensued on the expiry of the notice period.	Reasoning
The arbitration clause of the Concession Agreements provides sufficient recourse to remedies which can be availed of.	Reasoning
That apart, the order of the High Court dated 4 October 2019 has also clarified that the rest of the dispute that remains after the deposit of 80 per cent of the debt due, either arising out of the CAG report, the validity of the termination notices issued by both the parties and any past or future inter se claims and liabilities shall be agitated and decided in the arbitration proceedings.	Reasoning
In view of the order which we propose to pass, the dispute between the High Court in the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution shall stand worked out by granting liberty to the parties to avail of their rights and remedies in accordance with law.	Reasoning
Conclusion We accordingly dispose of the appeals in terms of the following directions HSVP shall within a period of three months from the date of the present judgment deposit into the Escrow Account 80 per cent of the debt due as determined in the reports of the auditors dated 23 June 2020, in the case of RMGL and RMGSL respectively The deposit into the Escrow Account shall continue to be maintained in Escrow, subject to any order that may be passed by NCLAT or any competent statutory authority, and shall not be appropriated by the Escrow Bank without specific permission RMGL and RMGSL on the one hand, and HSVP on the other, are at liberty to pursue their rights and remedies in pursuance of the arbitration clause contained in the Concession Agreements on all matters falling within the ambit of the arbitration agreement, including the validity of the notices of termination, any past or future inter	Decision
