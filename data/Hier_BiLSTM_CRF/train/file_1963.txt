On July 22, 2005, this Court passed an order to list the petition for final disposal on a nonmiscellaneous day after three weeks.	Facts
The order dated November 16, 2005 shows that back door admission sacrificing merit was granted to Anusha Singh (respondent No.6) by the Director, Pt. B.D. Sharma, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak.	Facts
The Court observed Learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 8 does not seriously dispute the allegation about the back door admission having been granted to respondent No. 6, as alleged by the petitioner.	Reasoning
Learned counsel further states that, in fact, the said Director had granted other similar admissions as well and some enquiries are pending against him.	Reasoning
This is also the stand of the petitioner.	None
The Court also observed that admission for academic year 2004 could not be granted to the petitioner at that stage.	Facts

11.	None

12.	None
It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner deserved to be adequately compensated for having been denied admission though he was entitled to.	Arguments of Petitioner
The newly added respondent was asked to file affidavit in support of the claim of compensation made by the petitioner.	Arguments of Petitioner
No such affidavit was, however, filed within the stipulated period and time was sought which was granted on August 10, 2006 by the Court on payment of a sum of Rs.5000/ to the petitioner.	Arguments of Petitioner
The affidavit was filed by respondent No. 9 on August 23, 2006 to which a rejoinder was filed by the petitioner on September 7, 2006.13.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.	None
14.	None
The learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that the impugned action taken by the respondentauthorities was totally illegal, unlawful and unconstitutional.	None
Though the petitioner had obtained 128 marks out of 180 marks and he was ranked at Sl.	None
NO. 418, he was arbitrarily placed at rank No. 423 which was improper.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even if it is assumed that the said action could not be said to be illegal and he would have continued at rank No. 423, there was no earthly reason for respondent authorities and particularly respondent No. 9 to grant admission on the last day, i.e. September 30, 2004 to respondent No. 6 who was admittedly placed below at rank No. 442.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the petitioner, the action of respondent No. 9 was clearly malicious and mala fide and back door entry was given to respondent No. 6 on extraneous considerations.	Arguments of Petitioner
From the beginning the modus operandi of respondent No. 9 was apparent inasmuch as petitioner was never informed about the counselling which were to take place.	None
It was only through his own sources that the petitioner came to know about the first, second and third counselling and attended them.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also submitted that he had made it abundantly clear from the beginning that he wanted to get admission in MBBS course in any Government college institute and if he is not in a position to be accommodated in MBBS course, his first choice would be Government Dental College, Rohtak.	Arguments of Petitioner
Respondent No. 9 was, therefore, aware of this fact and yet he granted illegal admission to respondent No. 6.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said action was totally illegal, arbitrary and malicious.	Reasoning
The petitioner was, therefore, entitled to get admission in Government Medical College, Rohtak, when respondent No. 6 Anusha Singh was admitted.	Reasoning
Since he was denied admission and his right was ignored, he is entitled to the difference in payment of fee at Mullana and Rohtak and also to adequate compensation.	Reasoning
So far as the amount of compensation is concerned, the petitioner has filed additional affidavit on November 25, 2005 wherein the breakups have been given in differential amount in tuition fee, hostel charges, etc.	Reasoning
He has claimed Rs. 5 lacs towards loss of better exposure in terms of education and practical training in Government Dental College and better job prospects.	Reasoning
Further amount of Rs. 5 lacs has been claimed towards acute mental and physical agony, frustration and feeling of injustice.	Reasoning
Cost of Rs. 50,000/ is also claimed.	Reasoning
According to the petitioner, all these amounts are required to be paid at the interest of 10 from August 18, 2004, the initial date of payment of tuition fee and hostel charges by the petitioner to respondent No.8.	Reasoning
15.	None
So far as respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 8 are concerned, initially an affidavit was filed on January 12, 2005 by Dr. (Major General) Virendra Singh, Director of Pt. B.D. Sharma Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak in the capacity of Director of the Institute.	Reasoning
In that affidavit, the deponent stated that the petitioner had secured 128 marks and his rank was 418, but after breaking the tie of candidates who had secured 128 marks, his rank was changed from 418 to 423 which was proper and in accordance with rules.	Reasoning
It was also stated that at the first counselling on August 9, 2004, the petitioner could not get admission in BDS course in Government Dental College, Rohtak and was admitted to M.M. Dental College, Mullana under General Category as per his merit and option.	Reasoning
The second and third counselling were held on August 28, and September 29, 2004 respectively for filling up the vacant seats in different medical dental colleges.	Reasoning
The petitioner attended second and third counselling, but he neither opted for any change nor got himself waitlisted for any medical dental college.	Reasoning
It was then stated that on September 30, 2004, a letter was received from the Principal, Government Dental College, Rohtak regarding vacancy of three seats in Government Dental College, Rohtak due to nondeposit of fees by three selected students.	Reasoning
September 30 was the last date for admission for the Academic Session 2004 for all Dental Colleges as held by this Court in Medical Council of India v. Madhu Singh Ors., (2002) 7 SCC 258.	Reasoning
It was, therefore, not possible to conduct counselling at the last moment and the only course available to the authorities was to fill three seats which remained vacant by admitting the next waitlisted candidates.	Reasoning
The three candidates including Anusha Singh, respondent No. 6 were, therefore, admitted on that day.	Reasoning
16.	None
The deponent denied the allegations made by the petitioner against the authorities.	None
Drawing distinction between the case of respondent No. 6 and the petitioner, the Director stated that though the petitioner appeared at the third counselling, he had not opted for any change and secondly there was no vacancy in the Government Dental College, Rohtak on that day.	None
Regarding representation said to have been made by the petitioner, the deponent stated on oath that no representation from the petitioner was received by his office.	None
17.	None
Respondent No. 5 in his affidavit stated that admission was granted to the petitioner and other students on the basis of Entrance Test.	None
In rejoinderaffidavit to counteraffidavit of respondent No. 2 and 5, the petitioner reiterated what he had stated in the petition.	None
He made grievance that respondent No. 2 had not placed before the Court the relevant material as to how the rank of the petitioner was changed from 418 to 423.	None
He also repeated that he got himself waitlisted and respondent No. 2 had wrongly stated that though the petitioner attended second and third counselling, he neither opted for any change nor got himself waitlisted for any other medical dental college.	None
18.	None
The petitioner thereafter stated that if the petitioner had not opted for any change nor had opted himself to be wait listed for any other medical dental college, there was no reason for him to attend the second and third counselling.	Reasoning
From the respondent No. 2s admission that the petitioner had attended the second and third counselling, it is clear that the petitioner wanted to change his college and had opted to be wait listed.	Reasoning
19.	None
It was also stated that respondent No. 2 had not denied that the petitioner at the time of first counselling itself had intimated his preference for MBBS course in any of the Medical Colleges or BDS in Government Dental College, Rohtak and when he was informed that there was no seat available, he opted for BDS in MM College of Dental Science Research, Mullana.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further said that he was allowed to attend all the counselling which also proved that the petitioner stood waitlisted and wanted to take admission in Government Dental College, Rohtak after the first counselling in which he got admission at Mullana.	Arguments of Petitioner
Regarding representation made by him to respondent No. 2, the Petitioner stated in the rejoinderaffidavit that the said representation was sent on October 19, 2004 by speed post and the same was delivered to respondent No. 2.	None
Alongwith the affidavit in rejoinder, he had produced a copy of the original receipt dated October 19, 2004 issued by the Post Office in the nature of Confirmation Report of service upon the authority.	Reasoning
As already stated earlier, the main grievance of the petitioner was that it was the Director who had granted illegal admission by allowing back door entry to respondent No. 6 and the said action was illegal and contrary to law.	Reasoning
In the circumstances, the petitioner filed Interim Application No. 4 of 2005 praying for impleadment of Dr. (Major General) Virendra Singh, ExDirector of Pt. B.D. Sharma Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak which was granted and notice was issued to him directing him to file affidavit in reply.	Reasoning
Respondent No. 9, pursuant to the above order filed additional affidavit at a belated stage on August 23, 2006 denying the allegations of mala fide levelled against him.	Reasoning
In the said affidavit, he had stated that since he had left the institute, he was not aware as to what was happening in the matter.	Reasoning
He also stated that the deponent alone has no role to play in the admission of the students in the college.	Reasoning
He admitted about counselling which took place on August 9, August 28 and September 29, 2004.	Reasoning
He also admitted that the last date for filling up of all the seats was September 30 and the admissions were completed.	Reasoning
According to him, though the petitioner was at rank No. 418, he was placed at Sl.	Reasoning
No. 423 considering the breaking up of tie.	Reasoning
He then stated that the petitioner accepted the seat at BDS, Mullana in the first counselling, but did not request for any waitlisting in any particular college or at all.	Reasoning
On September 29, 2004, the Counselling Committee after filling up all the available seats in all colleges, had ruled that all admissions should be completed by September 30, 2004.	Reasoning
He then stated that in any case, the petitioner had appeared in the first counselling and got his college BDS, Maullana and did not ask for any waitlisting.	Reasoning
He appeared in second counselling but did not seek change of the seat college but asked for wait listing.	Reasoning
He appeared in the third counselling also and did not seek any change and did not waitlist.	Reasoning
There are many who took seats and wanted to waitlist and then did not change the seats.	Reasoning
20.	None
According to the deponent, around 5.00 p.m. on September 30, 2004, a report was received from the Principal, Government Dental College, Rohtak that three candidates had not taken admission and thus three seats were available.	Arguments of Respondent
Then immediately the names of the candidates as per the merit list who were in the waitlist were called and that is how Anusha Singh, respondent No. 6 was granted admission.	Arguments of Respondent
Other persons were not present.	Arguments of Respondent
Since, the petitioner was not present and respondent No. 6 was present who was a waitlisted candidate, she was admitted.	Arguments of Respondent
He also stated that the petitioner did not opt for change and got himself waitlisted clearly indicated that he was satisfied with the seat allotted to him.	Arguments of Respondent
Even if he had waitlisted himself, he was required to remain present at the time of closing of the admission to take a chance that if some seats remained vacant and if candidates above him were not available, he could be admitted.	Arguments of Respondent
21.	None
The Dental Council of India stated that the case of the petitioner should be decided by the authorities in accordance with law.	Arguments of Respondent
But it was submitted that no admission in the BDS Course for the academic year 200405 after September 30, 2004 could be granted.	Arguments of Respondent
22.	None
The learned counsel for the authorities submitted that the impugned action could not be said to be contrary to law.	Arguments of Respondent
So far as respondent No. 9 is concerned, the counsel appearing for him submitted that the said respondent acted in accordance with Admission Rules as also the law laid down by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Since the petitioner neither waitlisted himself nor was present on September 30, 2004, admission was granted to respondent No. 6.	Arguments of Respondent
The petitioner cannot make grievance against such an act.	Arguments of Respondent
Counsel for Medical Council of India submitted that the statutory time schedule for commencement of course and admission to medical dental courses as laid down by this Court in Mridul Dhar v. Union of India, (2005) 2 SCC 65 is required to be complied with and failure to adherence strictly to the said time schedule has created all these problems.	Arguments of Respondent
He, therefore, submitted that this Court may again direct the authorities to adhere to the timeschedule in Mridul Dhar. 23.	Arguments of Respondent
Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, we are of the view that in the light of what has been asserted by the petitioner and denied by respondent No. 9, and in view of order dated November 16, 2005, no admission could be granted to the petitioner in the Government Dental College, Rohtak.	None
There is word against word so far as waitlisting of the petitioner is concerned.	None
According to the petitioner, he got himself waitlisted at the first counselling on August 9, 2004 when he was admitted to Dental College at Mullana.	None
Prima facie, he is right in so submitting keeping in view his subsequent conduct.	None
If he was satisfied with the admission in Dental College, Mullana and was not interested in getting himself admitted to Government Dental College, Rohtak or in changing the institute college, it was not necessary for him to remain present at the second and third counselling.	None
It was because of the fact that though he was admitted to Private Dental College at Mullana, he was seeking admission in Government Dental College, Rohtak that he attended second and third counselling.	None
24.	None
So far as the factum of attendance at second and third counselling is concerned, the fact has not been denied.	None
On the contrary, it is admitted by respondent No. 9 in his affidavit.	None
But, the petitioner has not expressly and unequivocally stated that he was present on September 30, 2004 when respondent No. 6 Anusha Singh was granted admission.	None
According to respondent No. 9, the petitioner was not present.	None
Up to September 29, 2004, no vacant seat was available at Government Dental College, Rohtak.	None
It was only on September 30, 2004 that because of default in payment of fee by three candidates, three vacancies were to be filled in at Rohtak.	None
According to respondent No. 9, the seats were filled by the candidates who were present on that day and admission was granted to those students who were eligible.	None
Respondent No. 6, though she was at Sl.	None
No. 442, got admission as she was present.	None
25.	None
In our opinion, there is intrinsic evidence also which goes to show that probably the petitioner was not present on September 30, 2004.	Reasoning
Admittedly, respondent No. 6 Anusha Singh was granted admission on September 30, 2006.	Reasoning
It is the case of the petitioner from the beginning that on or about October 17, 2004, the petitioner came to know that admission was illegally granted to respondent No. 6 though her rank was 442 and rank of petitioner was 423.	Reasoning
He, therefore, submitted a representation on October 19, 2004.	Reasoning
Had the petitioner been present on September 30, 2004, he would have objected to the admission of respondent No. 6.	Reasoning
Again he would have immediately come to know about her admission.	Reasoning
In that case, he would have instantly approached the authorities putting forward his claim, but it was not done.	Reasoning
In fact, a representation was made for the first time after about 18 days stating therein that he came to know on October 17, 2004 that admission was given to respondent No. 6 ignoring his legitimate claim.	Reasoning
In the circumstances, in our opinion, grant of admission to respondent No. 6 on September 30, 2004 cannot be cancelled at this stage.	None
26.	None
It was then contended by the petitioner that it is clearly established from the facts on record that injustice has been done to him.	Arguments of Petitioner
Initially, the petitioner was at rank No. 418 which was arbitrarily and without there being rational basis placed at 423.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even though the petitioner had waitlisted himself at first counselling on August 9, 2004, and precisely for that reason, he attended the second and third counselling, overlooking his legitimate claim and without affording an opportunity to get admission, respondent No. 6 who was at rank No. 442 had been admitted.	Reasoning
This is, therefore, eminently a fit case, submitted the learned counsel, to direct payment of compensation over and above the difference in payment of tuition fee and hostel fee for Private Dental College as against Government Dental College.	Reasoning
27.	None
In this connection, the learned counsel submitted that it is settled law that a remedy provided by Article 32 (as also by Article 226) of the Constitution is a public law remedy.	Arguments of Petitioner
The lis in this case cannot be said to be a private dispute between two parties.	None
Respondent No. 9 was acting as a public authority and since he had acted arbitrarily, maliciously and deprived the petitioner of his legitimate and rightful claim and extended undeserved benefit to respondent No. 6, an order of payment of compensation would serve the ends of justice.	Reasoning
28.	None
The learned counsel for the petitioner in this connection, invited our attention to several cases.	Arguments of Petitioner
Particular reference was made to a leading case in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, (1987) 1 SCC 395.	Arguments of Petitioner
In M.C.Mehta, a writ petition was filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution directing Shriram, a Public Limited Company to pay compensation to victims of escape of oleum gas.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended on behalf of the Company that the petition was not maintainable and the Company could not be held liable to pay compensation.29.	Arguments of Petitioner
Negativing the contention and holding the Company liable to pay compensation, this Court, speaking through Bhagwati C.J. stated Law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country.	None
As new situations arise the law to be developed in order to meet the challenge of such new situations.	None
Law cannot afford to remain static.	None
We have to evolve new principles and lay down new norms which would adequately deal with the new problems which arise in a highly industralised economy.	None
We cannot allow our judicial thinking to be constricted by reference to the law as it prevails in England or for the matter of that in any other foreign country.	None
We no longer need the crutches of a foreign legal order.	None
We are certainly prepared to receive light from whatever source it comes	None
but we have to build our own jurisprudence and we cannot countenance an argument that merely because the law in England does not recognise the rule of strict and absolute liability in cases of hazardous or inherently dangerous activities or the rule laid down in Rylands v. Fletcher as developed in England recognises certain limitations and exceptions, we in India must hold back our hands and not venture to evolve a new principle of liability since English courts have not done so.	None
We have to develop our own law and if we find that it is necessary to construct a new principle of liability to deal with an unusual situation which has arisen and which is likely to arise in future on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries which are concomitant to an industrial economy, there is no reason why we should hesitate to evolve such principle of liability merely because it has not been so done in England.	None
We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and nondelegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to anyone on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity which it has undertaken.	None
30.	None
Emphasising underlying object of Article 32, the Court said If the Court were powerless to issue any direction, order or writ in cases where a fundamental right has already been violated, Article 32 would be robbed of all its efficacy, because then the situation would be that if a fundamental right is threatened to be violated, the court can injunct such violation but if the violator is quick enough to take action infringing the fundamental right, he would escape from the net of Article 32.	None
That would, to a large extent, emasculate the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 32 and render it impotent and futile.	None
We must, therefore, hold that Article 32 is not powerless to assist a person when he finds that his fundamental right has been violated.	None
He can in that event seek remedial assistance under Article 32.	None
The power of the court to grant such remedial relief may include the power to award compensation in appropriate cases.	None
Reference was also made to another leading decision of this Court in Nilabati Behera vs. State of Orissa Ors., (1993) 2 SCC 746 .	Arguments of Petitioner
In that case, a young man of 22 years was taken to police custody for investigation of an offence.	None
He was handcuffed, tied and severely beaten.	None
On the next day, his dead body was found lying on railway track.	None
Mother of the deceased addressed a letter to this Court alleging custodial death of his son and claimed compensation on the ground of violation of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.	None
The letter was treated as writ petition and compensation was awarded.	None
Referring to earlier decisions, Verma J. (as His Lordship then was) spelt out the principle on which the liability of State arises in such cases.	None
It was held that award of compensation in a proceeding under Article 32 or 226 of the Constitution is a remedy available in public law based on strict liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply.	None
Agreeing with judgments in earlier cases, His Lordship stated We respectfully concur with the view that the court is not helpless and the wide powers given to this Court by Article 32, which itself is a fundamental right, imposes a constitutional obligation on this Court to forge such new tools, which may be necessary for doing complete justice and enforcing the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution, which enable the award of monetary compensation in appropriate cases, where that is the only mode of redress available.	None
The power available to this Court under Article 142 is also an enabling provision in this behalf.	Reasoning
The contrary view would not merely render the court powerless and the constitutional guarantee a mirage but may, in certain situations, be an incentive to extinguish life, if for the extreme contravention the court is powerless to grant any relief against the State, except by punishment of the wrongdoer for the resulting offence, and recovery of damages under private law, by the ordinary process.	Reasoning
It the guarantee that deprivation of life and personal liberty cannot be made except in accordance with law, is to be real, the enforcement of the right in case of every contravention must also be possible in the constitutional scheme, the mode of redress being that which is appropriate in the facts of each case.	Reasoning
This remedy in public law has to be more readily available when invoked by the have not, who are not possessed of the wherewithal for enforcement of their rights in private law, even though its exercise is to be tempered by judicial restraint to avoid circumvention of private law remedies, where more appropriate.	Reasoning
Anand, J. (as His Lordship then was) agreed with the observations of Verma J. and stated Adverting to the grant of relief to the heirs of a victim of custodial death forthe infraction or invasion of his rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, it is not always enough to relegate him to the ordinary remedy of a civil suit to claim damages for the tortuous act of the State as that remedy in private law indeed is available to the aggrieved party.	None
The citizen complaining of the infringement of the indefeasible right under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot be told that for the established violation of the fundamental right to fife, he cannot get any relief under the public law by the courts exercising writ jurisdiction.	None
The primary source of the public law proceedings stems from the prerogative writs and the courts have, therefore, to evolve new tools to give relief in public law by molding it according to the situation with a view to preserve and protect the Rule of Law.	None
While concluding his first Hamlyn Lecture in 1949 under the title Freedom under the Law Lord Denning in his own style warned No one can suppose that the executive will never be guilty of the sins that are common to all of us.	None
You may be sure that they will sometimes do things which they ought not to do and will not do things that they ought to do.	None

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the Court in a Review Petition was not right in setting aside the direction for payment of Rs. 50 lakhs personally from the Minister concerned, particularly when the Court had recorded a finding earlier that act was illegal, improper and unconstitutional act on the part of the Minister concerned.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also submitted that wrong test was applied by the Court in a Review by adopting analogy of criminal trial and referring to provisions of Section 405 and 409 of the Penal Code and by observing that in case of criminal breach of trust, entrustment of property was an essential ingredient, which was not proved.	Arguments of Petitioner
Though we find considerable force in the submission of the learned counsel, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, we are not inclined to enter into larger question in view of the fact that it is not necessary to do so.	None
Since, we are of the view and have held that on September 30, 2004, the petitioner in all probability was not present and admission was granted to respondent No. 6 Anusha Singh and the first complaint was made by him as late as on October 19, 2004 by stating that he had come to know about the illegality of admission in favour of respondent No. 6 on October 17, 2004, in exercise of extraordinary powers under Article 32 of the Constitution, it would not be appropriate for this Court to award compensation to the petitioner either from the authorities or from the respondent No. 9 in his personal capacity.	Reasoning
It is, however, open to the petitioner to take appropriate proceedings in accordance with law, if so advised.	Reasoning
As and when such eventuality arises, the appropriate authority will pass an appropriate order in accordance with law without being inhibited or influenced by the observations made by us in this judgment.	Reasoning
Before closing the matter, we may observe one thing more.	None
As already noted earlier, as early as on November 16, 2005, when the matter was heard by this Court, a grievance was made by the petitioner that though he was higher in rank, admission was illegally given to respondent No. 6 who was lower in rank.	Reasoning
It was a back door admission, sacrificing merit and was granted by Dr. (Major General) Virendra Singh, Director of Pt. B.D. Sharma Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak.	Reasoning
The learned counsel appearing for respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 8 did not seriously dispute the allegation about the back door admission having been granted to respondent No. 6 as alleged by the petitioner.	Reasoning
The Court further observed Learned counsel further states that, in fact, the said Director had granted other similar admissions as well and some enquiries are pending against him.	Reasoning
In the additional affidavit dated November 25, 2005, in para 4, it was stated by the petitioner that as a result of the grave allegation of misuse of public office by Dr. (Maj Gen.) Virendra Singh, he has been removed from the post of Director of Pt. B.D. Sharma Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak and enquiry is pending against him.	Reasoning
After Dr. (Maj Gen.)	Reasoning
Virendra Singh was arrayed as respondent No. 9 and had filed affidavit after the above additional affidavit filed by the petitioner, it was only stated that para No. 4 was absolutely false, wrong and was denied.	Reasoning
It is also clear that he was not holding the post of Director when he filed the said affidavit by admitting that he had left the office.	Reasoning
It was also the case of the State as reflected in the order dated November 16, 2005 passed by this Court that illegal admission was granted by respondent No. 9.	Reasoning
In the circumstances, it would have been appropriate if the State had filed an affidavit placing necessary facts before this Court.	Reasoning
It is the duty of the State Government to see not only that the officers act in consonance with law, but also to ensure that no injustice has been done to meritorious students.	Reasoning
Unfortunately however, the State Government has not properly assisted the Court by placing the relevant facts as are expected to be placed by a public authority.	Reasoning
But in the light of what has been stated earlier, since we are not in a position to grant relief to the petitioner, we leave the matter there.	Reasoning
33.	None
For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner is not entitled to relief from this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution.	Decision
The petition deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed, however without any order as to costs.	Decision
