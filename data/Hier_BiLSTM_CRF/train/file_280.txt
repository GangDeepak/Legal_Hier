Learned senior counsel also relied on the recent judgment of this Court dated 21 st August, 2019 passed in Criminal Appeal No.1165 of 2019 wherein in similar circumstances FIR was quashed by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and after perusing the impugned order and other material placed on record, we are of the view that the High Court exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction conferred under Section 482 CrPC, and quashed the proceedings.	Reasoning
Even before the investigation is completed by the investigating agency, the High Court entertained the Writ Petition, and by virtue of interim order granted by the High Court, further investigation was stalled.	Reasoning
Having regard to the allegations made by the appellant informant, whether the 2nd respondent by clicking inappropriate pictures of the appellant has blackmailed her or not, and further the 2 nd respondent has continued to interfere by calling Shoukin Malik or not are the matters for investigation.	Reasoning
In view of the serious allegations made in the complaint, we are of the view that the High Court should not have made a roving inquiry while considering the application filed under Section 482 CrPC.	Reasoning
Though the learned counsels have made elaborate submissions on various contentious issues, as we are of the view that any observation or findings by this Court, will affect the investigation and trial, we refrain from recording any findings on such issues.	Reasoning
From a perusal of the order of the High Court, it is evident that the High Court has got carried away by the agreement settlement arrived at, between the parties, and recorded a finding that the physical relationship of the appellant with the 2nd respondent was consensual.	Reasoning
When it is the allegation of the appellant, that such document itself is obtained under threat and coercion,it is a matter to be investigated.	Reasoning
Further, the complaint of the appellant about interference by the 2nd respondent by calling Shoukin Malik and further interference is also a matter for investigation.	Reasoning
By looking at the contents of the complaint and the serious allegations made against the 2nd respondent, we are of the view that the High Court has committed error in quashing the proceedings.	Reasoning
During the course of hearing, learned counsel for the appellant, brought to our notice provision Section 114A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.	Reasoning
Section 114A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 deals with the presumption as to absence of consent in certain prosecution for rape.	Reasoning
A reading of the aforesaid Section makes it clear that, where sexual intercourse by the accused is proved and the question is whether it was without the consent of the woman alleged to have been raped, and such woman states in her evidence before the Court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent.	Reasoning
Though Learned senior counsel Sri Mukul Rohatgi relied on the judgment of this Court dated 21 st August,2019 in Criminal Appeal No.1165 of 2019, but we are of the view that the said judgment would not render any assistance to support his case.	Reasoning
Whether in a given case power under Section 482 is to be exercised or not, depends on the contents of the complaint, and the material placed on record.	Reasoning
In that view of the matter, we are of the view that it is a fit case to set aside the order passed by the High Court and allow the investigating agency to proceed with the further investigation in accordance with law.	Reasoning
It is made clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the complaint, and it is open to the investigating agency and competent court, to proceed in accordance with law.	Reasoning
For the aforesaid reasons, this criminal appeal is allowed and the impugned order dated 13 th December, 2018 passed in R Special Criminal Application No.9897 of 2017 by the High Court of Gujarat is setaside.	Decision
The 2nd respondent shall appear before the concerned Police Station on 18112019 at 11.00 a.m. and cooperate with the investigation.	Decision
Till then no coercive action shall be taken against him.	Decision
