Facts
Likewise, there was no reasonable justification to impose any restriction like retention of passport and the Division Bench directed return of the passport to respondent No.1defendant No.4.	Facts
Aggrieved by the order of the Division Bench, the appellant came before us.	Facts
Learned Senior counsel for the appellant has contended that upon initiation of contempt proceedings by the appellant, respondent No.1 gave an unconditional undertaking to clear the charges created over a portion of the suit property within four months however, such undertaking turned out to be mere words and no such charge was cleared by the first respondent within the period which he has undertaken.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that respondent No.1 was repeatedly giving evasive replies and undertakings but failed to comply with the same.	Arguments of Petitioner
Drawing our attention to the affidavit dated 27.08.2016, learned Senior counsel for the appellant has submitted that in the said affidavit, respondent No.1 has stated that he is still residing in Delhi, when in fact he had already shifted along with his family to Singapore in May, 2016 itself.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior counsel further submitted that the present case is not a case of impounding of passport rather the present case is where the learned Single Judge directed respondent No.1 to deposit the passport as per his undertaking in terms of his affidavit dated 10.03.2017 so as to ensure the presence of respondent No.1 since the Court was of the view that respondent No.1 would leave India for Singapore.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that while dealing with the contempt petition, in order to ensure compliance of the orders of the Court and make sure that the parties adhere to the undertakings filed before the Court, the Court has the power to direct deposit of the passport and the Division Bench erred in setting aside the order of the learned Single Judge.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondents has submitted that respondent No.1 and his father Late Sarabjit Prakash has made all the efforts to clear the bank dues but due to unavoidable circumstances, they could not clear the charge.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel submitted that the equitable market value of the suit property No.68, Friends Colony (West), New Delhi was made even in October, 2017 much prior to the alleged exparte stay order dated 02.06.2008.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that the learned Single Judge was not right in passing various orders restricting the jurisdiction of the DRT for recovery of the Bank dues when the Bank of India is not made a party to the suit.	Arguments of Respondent
It was further submitted that there is already an order of statusquo passed in the suit being CS (OS) No.1134 of 2008 and therefore, there was no need for the learned Single Judge to direct respondent No.1 to deposit his passport and issue direction for not leaving the country.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that in 2012, the bank sought the permission of the Court to sell the first floor to recover its dues but the bank did not pursue and resultantly, the said application was dismissed and while so, it was not justified for the learned Single Judge to take the burden of the bank and directing respondent No.1 to clear the dues.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that coercive directions given by the learned Single Judge compelling respondent No.1 to clear the dues was not warranted and rightly set aside by the Division Bench and the impugned order does not warrant interference.	Arguments of Respondent
We have carefully considered the submissions of both the sides and perused the impugned judgment and other materials on record.	None
Sarabjit Prakash was directed to be personally present before the Court on 30.05.2013.	None
On the next date of hearing i.e. 30.05.2013, Sarabjit Prakash was not present in the Court and the matter was listed for 02.07.2013.	None
By the order dated 02.07.2013, Sarabjit Prakash (defendant No.1) and respondent No.1defendant No.4 who were present in the Court stated that if four months time is given to them, they will ensure that the dues of Bank of India are discharged and part of the suit property which is charged with the Bank of India namely, First floor of 68, Friends Colony (West), New Delhi, shall be freed of all charges encumbrances.	None
Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 have also stated that they will file appropriate affidavit to that effect and on such statement, the contempt petition was kept in abeyance for four months.	None
Accordingly, Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 have filed affidavit of undertaking before the Court on 15.07.2013 undertaking that they will clear the dues of Bank of India when the property bearing No.68, First Floor, Friends Colony (West), New Delhi shall be freed of all charges encumbrances within a period of four months and that they will make arrangement of the loan amount to be paid to the Bank of India from other moveable and immoveable properties in the name of Sarabjit Prakash.	Reasoning
When the matter was taken up by the Court, the Court noted that as per undertaking, the amount has not been paid to the Bank and Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 have failed to clear the charge over the suit property as per undertaking.	None
The appellant again filed I.A No.41 of 2013 under Order XXXIX Rule 2A against Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 for not complying with the respective undertaking statement made before the Court.	Facts
On 24.01.2014, Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 filed a joint reply stating that due to unavoidable circumstances, they are unable to clear the charge over the suit property and undertaking to clear the charge over the suit property from the amount received from 33, Sundar Nagar, New Delhi.	Facts
On application filed by the appellant in I.A. No.21764 of 2015, on 20.10.2015, the High Court directed that amount of Rs.3.50 crores will not be utilized by Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 except to the extent of meeting the medical expenses of Sarabjit Prakash.	None

On 02.03.2017, the Court recorded that the encumbrances on the suit property were not cleared till date and directed respondent No.1 to deposit his passport and furnish the security.	Facts
On the next date of hearing i.e. 07.03.2017, respondent No.1 offered three properties owned by his motherinlaw (Rama Khanna from Amritsar) by depositing title deeds stating that he has no other security to offer.	None
Observing that respondent No.1 has failed to comply with his undertakings statements, on 26.05.2017, the learned Single Judge directed respondent No.1 to deposit his passport and made an order restraining respondent No.1 from leaving India.	Facts
According to respondent No.1, he has shown his bonafide by producing additional security before the Court by depositing original title deeds of three properties belonging to his motherinlaw (Rama Khanna from Amritsar) to the tune of Rs.4.45 crores.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has submitted that equitable mortgage of the suit property (i.e. 68, Friends Colony (West), First Floor, New Delhi) was made even in the first week of October, 2007 which was much prior to the exparte stay order dated 02.06.2008.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel further submitted that in October, 2008, additional Working Capital was granted to the companyM s. Soul Attires Creations Private Limited for Rs.5 crores (against Stock and Book Debts) as per banking regulations.	Arguments of Respondent
According to respondent No.1, this enhanced limit is never a loan against the property but only against Stocks and Book Debts.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1 has submitted that respondent No.1 is a bonafide legal owner of the suit property by means of registered will made in his favour by his fatherSarabjit Prakash dated 29.09.2006 who had the legal title in his name by way of registered sale deed executed by his wife Usha Prakash in exercise of the power vested in her through the registered Power of Attorney dated 03.01.2002 given to her by her mother Niamat Sahni and thus, respondent No.1 claims title over the suit property No.68, Friends Colony (West), First Floor, New Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
The question regarding the correctness of the sale deed executed by Usha Prakash mother of respondent No.1 in favour of Sarabjit Prakash and the dispute raised regarding the title of the property could be determined only in the suit after parties adduced oral and documentary evidence.	Arguments of Respondent
The short point falling for consideration is whether respondent No.1 is to be proceeded for contempt and whether the learned Single Judge was right in directing the deposit of first respondents passport.	Issue
Of course, on 15.07.2013, Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 filed an undertaking that they shall clear dues of Bank of India and the suit property shall be cleared of all charges encumbrances within a period of four months and that they shall make arrangement of the loan amount to be paid to the Bank of India from other moveable and immoveable properties.	Reasoning
Subsequently also, Sarabjit Prakash and respondent No.1 filed an undertaking before the Court.	Reasoning
Having filed the undertaking, it was required of the first respondent to keep up to his undertaking filed before the Court.	None
On behalf of respondent No.1, learned counsel submitted that respondent No.1 was making genuine efforts to pay the amount to the Bank and clear the charge on the property but due to unavoidable circumstances, they could not clear the charge over the suit property.	None
As pointed out earlier, Sarabjit Prakash was suffering from illness and passed away within one week after the order was passed on 20.10.2015.	None
Since repeated undertakings were filed and the same were not complied with, learned Single Judge directed respondent No.1 to surrender his passport.	Reasoning
The said order was passed to ensure the presence of the first respondent and compliance of the order of the Court.	Reasoning
It cannot be said that the learned Single Judge exceeded the jurisdiction or committed an error in ordering surrender of the passport.	Reasoning
In order to ensure the presence of the parties in the contempt proceedings, the Court is empowered to pass appropriate orders including the surrender of passport.	Reasoning
While dealing with child custody matter, in David Jude vs. Hannah Grace Jude and Another (2003) 10 SCC 767 , the Supreme Court directed Union of India to cancel the passport of contemnor No.1 and to take necessary steps to secure the presence of contemnor No.1 with the child in India and to ensure her appearance before the Court on the date of hearing.	Reasoning
It is pointed out that the Division Bench proceeded as if the learned Single Judge has ordered impounding of the passport of respondent No.1 whereas, the learned Single Judge has only directed respondent No.1 to deposit his passport in the Court.	Reasoning
As discussed earlier, the purpose of directing respondent No.1 to surrender his passport was only to ensure the presence of respondent No.1 who was filing repeated undertakings before the Court but was not complying with the same.	Reasoning
In our view, the Division Bench was not right in setting aside the order of the learned Single Judge in directing respondent No.1 to deposit his passport before the Court and the judgment of the Division Bench cannot be sustained.	Reasoning
In order to ensure the presence of respondent No.1 and to ensure further progress of the trial, the order of the learned Single Judge directing respondent No.1 to deposit his passport before the Court stands confirmed.	Decision
On behalf of the appellant, it is stated that in view of the order of the Division Bench, the contempt petition has been disposed of by the learned Single Judge on 04.12.2018 and prayed for restoration of the contempt petition.	Arguments of Petitioner
Since the suit is of the year 2008 and much of the courts time has been spent on the interim orders and on the contempt petition, we are not inclined to issue direction for restoration of the contempt petition.	None
Since, the suit is of the year 2008 and the trial has already commenced and the matter is said to have been pending for crossexamination of the defendants witnesses, it is suffice to direct early expeditious disposal of the suit at the same time, ensuring that respondent No.1 will be available at the stage when the suit is disposed and in case he suffers an adverse decree.	Reasoning
The impugned order of the Division Bench dated 01.08.2018 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in FAO (OS) No.210 of 2017 is set aside and this appeal is allowed.	Decision
In order to ensure the presence of respondent No.1 and to ensure further progress of the trial, the order of the learned Single Judge directing respondent No.1 to deposit his passport before the Court stands confirmed.	Decision
The learned Single Judge is requested to take up the civil suit being CS (OS) No.1134 of 2008 and continue with the trial and dispose the same expeditiously preferably within a period of nine months.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
