Mr. T.N. Singh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit(i)	Arguments of Petitioner
The First Information Report is an ante timed one.	Arguments of Petitioner
From a perusal thereof, it would appear that occurrence had taken place on 30th July, 1989, but in the post mortem report, the time of death found to have been occurred within 36 hours therefrom	Arguments of Petitioner
and, thus, the occurrence must be held to have taken place on 30.7.1989 itself.	Arguments of Petitioner
The empty cartridge which was recovered was not sealed at the spot.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was marked with the words KF.	Arguments of Petitioner
The same was not of Indian origin but it bore the mark RF manufactured at Elekaina Company which was a British Company.(ii)	Arguments of Petitioner
Although, Appellant was not declared as an absconder, he was arrested on 20.8.1989 and the gun was seized only on 30.8.1989.(iii) P.W. 1 has made improvements in his deposition before the Court as the details of the occurrences had not been disclosed in the First Information Report.(iv)	Arguments of Petitioner
In the post mortem report, no blackening or tattoing having been found, it was likely that the manner in which the occurrence is said to have taken place, would be incorrect.(v)	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Trial Judge had acquitted Kalyan Singh and two others, the impugned judgment cannot be sustained as the appellant is similarly situated.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ms. Vibha Datta Makhija, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State on the other hand would submit (i) the occurrence took place on 31st July and not on 30th July, as would appear from the First Information Report itself.(ii)	Arguments of Respondent
The duration of occurrence, having been found in the post mortem report, to have occurred within 36 hours, it cannot be said that the occurrence could not have taken place on 31st July.(iii)	Arguments of Respondent
The Ballistic Expert Dr. J.P. Nigam, Assistant Director of Forensic Science Laboratory in his report having categorically stated that the shot was fired from the gun in question, the participation of the appellant in commiting the crime has clearly been established.	Arguments of Respondent
In its report, the ballistic expert opined Ex. EC1.	None
It is an empty Kartoosh of 12 Bore already fired.	None
For filing pin impression it was compared with TCs RB(A1) and TCsLB (A1).	None
Similarity was found between Ex. A1 and TCLB(A1) photomicrography of one condition of its similarity was taken and equal points were marked.	None
Ex.	None
P1  	None
This is a piece of iron whose weight is 4.550 gm.	None
Its length is 0.5 and width is 0.3 on one edge and on other edge is 0.45 It was opined Ex.	None
A1 is a gun of 12 bores of two barrel and Ex.	None
A2 is a gun of two barrels.	None
Both these are in running condition.	None
After chemical examination of the rest portions of barrel it has been confirmed that these were fired earlier, but it is not possible to say the last firing date of this on the basis of scientific certainty.	None
Ex. EC1 is an empty Kartoosh of 12 bores already fired.	None
For firing pin impression it was compared with TCS (A1) by microscope similarity was found between EC1 and TCLB (A1).	None
Therefore Kartoosh of Ex. EC1 has been fired from left barrel of Ex. A1.	None
In the receipt marked as Ext. A1, the empty cartridge was marked as Articles Ext. EC1 in a sealed and packed condition and thus there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the cartridge, in question, was the one which was recovered from the place of occurrence.	None
In his evidence also, the said Dr. J.P. Nigam stated Exhibit EC1	None
This is an empty cartridge fired from 12 bore and for its firing pin impression, its comparison by microscope TC A1, the similarity of EC1 and TCLB (A1) was found.	None
Therefore, Ex EC1 cartridge Ex A1 has been fired from left barrel., which also show the involvement of the appellant.	None
lthough there appeared to be some confusion with the gun bearing mark KF or RF but the same was clarified by P.W. 11 in his evidence stating that he identified the cartridge in question.	None
In regard to the wrong marking, he had stated On spot there was no piece of Karatoosh but there was a Khokha of Karatoosh there.	None
It is not written as RF and KF on Article B Karatoosh but I understood it as KF and accordingly, I had written on Ex. P5 panchnama as K.F. 1 has seen point 3 in sketch from the place A,B. The prosecution case in our opinion stands proved from the evidence of first informant Gyansingh and PW.	None
2 Munnalal.	None
It appears that a confusion in regard to date of occurrence as contended by Mr. Singh arose and only a Xeroxed copy of the F.I.R. was produced before us.	None
Ms. Makhija, however, has produced before us another Xeroxed copy of the first information report, from a perusal whereof it appears that the date of occurrence has therein also written in Hindi to be 31st July.	None
Even otherwise, the original First Information Report categorically shows that the dead body was brought in a tractor directly to the police station on 30.07.1989.	None
P.W. 8 and P.W. 11 also are witnesses to prove that the F.I.R. was recorded on 30.07.1982.	None
Those witnesses were not crossexamined on the question as to whether the occurrence had taken place on 31st July or 30th July.	None
We have noticed hereinbefore that the dead body was sent for post mortem immediately to the hospital.	None
Dr. A.K. Sharma noted in his post mortem report, the time when the dead body had been received at mortuary.	None
P.W. 11 recorded the statements of Ram Prasad, Jagdish Singh, Sughar Singh, P.W. 3, P.W. 4, P.W. 5 respectively on the same day.	None
He visited the spot on that day itself, but could not carry out the further investigation due to darkness.	None
He visited the place of occurrence on the next day and drew the sketch map, found clots of blood and recovered pieces of plastic and a 12 bore kartoosh.	None
He seized blood stained water in a bottle.	None
As noticed hereinbefore, in the Court, he identified the cartridge in question.	None
Identity of the blank cartridge recovered from the spot is not in question.	None
The manner in which the occurrence had taken place is clearly corroborated by the medical evidence, the correctness whereof again is not in question.	None
Duration of time between the actual death and the post mortem examination has been stated to be within 36 hours.	None
Had the occurrence taken place on 30th July, it would have been stated by Dr. Sharma to be more than 36 hours.	None
It is now well settled that the lapse of time of taking place of death cannot be accurately stated.	None
In Amrit Singh v State of Punjab AIR 2007 SC 132 , it was held Exact time as to when the occurrence took place is not known and it would be hazardous to make any guess in this behalf In Ramreddy Rajeshkhanna Reddy and Anr.	None
v State of Andhra Pradesh AIR 2006 SC 1656 , this Court opined In this case, the time of actual offence having regard to the different statements made by different witnesses may assume some importance as one of the grounds whereupon the High Court has based its judgment of conviction is the time of death of the deceased on the basis of the opinion rendered by Dr. P. Venkateshvarlu (P.W.13).	None
In Modis Medical Jurisprudence, 22nd edition, as regard duration of rigor mortis, it is statedAverageMinimumMaximumMaximumHoursMinutesHoursMinutesHoursMinutesDuration of rigor mortis191230400It was, therefore, extremely difficult to report the exact time of death of the deceased, more so when no sufficient reason was assigned in the post mortem report.	None
In Ramjee Rai and Ors. v State of Bihar 2006 (8) SCALE 440 , this Court held A contention was raised that autopsy surgeon opined that the death must have taken place 10 days prior to the post mortem examination and in that view of the matter the prosecution case should be disbelieved.	None
The murder allegedly took place on a boat.	None
The dead body was thrown in the water.	None
It remained under water for more than five days.	None
Rigor mortis was absent and the body was fully decomposed.	None
The soft tissues of some of the parts of the body had been eaten away by fish.	None
Medical science has not achieved such perfection so as to enable a medical practitioner to categorically state in regard to the exact time of death.	None
In a case of this nature, it was difficult to pinpoint the exact time of death.	None
The autopsy surgeon told about the approximate time lag between the date of post mortem examination and the likely date of death.	None
He did not explain the basis for arriving at his opinion.	None
This Court on a number of occasions noticed that it may not be possible for a doctor to pinpoint the exact time of death.	None
In Baso Prasad and Ors. v State of Bihar 2006 (12) SCALE 354 , this Court observed We may deal with the question as regards presence of rigour mortis.	None
In Modis Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology,21st Edn., at page 171, it is statedRigor mortis generally occurs, while the body is cooling.	None
It is in no way connected with the nervous system, and it develops even in paralyzed limbs, provided the paralyzed muscle tissues have not suffered much in nutrition.	None
It is retarded by perfusion with normal saline.	None
Owing to the setting in of rigor mortis all the muscles of the body become stiff, hard, opaque and contracted, but they do not alter the position of body or limb.	None
A joint rendered stiff and rigid after death, if flexed forcibly by mechanical violence, will remain supple and flaccid, but will not return to its original position after the force is withdrawn whereas a joint contracted during life in cases of hysteria or catalepsy will return to the same condition after the force is taken away.	None
The exact time of death, therefore, cannot be established scientifically and precisely, only because of presence of rigour mortis or in the absence of it.	None
Blackenning of the wound can be found only when the shot is fired from a short distance namely at about 3 to 4 feet and not beyond the same.	None
Absence of any blackening of the wound has rightly been not found in the post mortem examination.	None
The purported improvement made by P.W. 1 is not of much significance.	None
First Information Report, as noticed hereinbefore, was lodged at the quickest possible time.	None
A First Information Report is not supposed to be an encyclopedia of the entire event.	None
It cannot contain the minutest details of the events.	None
The essential material facts were disclosed in the First Information Report.	None
Even presence of P.W. 2, Munnalal had also been stated.	None
Statements of the other witnesses namely P.W. 3, P.W. 5 and P.W. 6 had also been recorded by the investigating officer on 31st July itself.	None
It is, therefore, difficult to accept the contentions of the learned counsel.	None
The First Information Report was recorded by the Head Constable.	None
Investigation was taken over from P.W. 11 by P.W. 12, R.S. Raghuvanshi and thereafter only the accused were arrested.	None
Seizure of the gun belonging to the appellant is proved not only by P.W. 12 but also by Murat Singh P.W. 9.	None
We may notice that even Kalyan Singh had surrendered in the Police Station on 20.8.1989.	None
Indisputably the gun as also the empty cartridge found at the spot was sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.	None
Qualification of Shri J.P. Nigam as a ballistic expert has not been doubted.	None
Although, there appears to be some confusion with regard to the marking of the parcel containing the empty cartridge, evidently the same had correctly been marked by Shri Nigam.	None
He found it in a sealed condition.	None
Only because P.W. 8 in his evidence did not state that the recovered empty cartridge was sealed at the spot, the same would not mean that it was planted later on, particularly when recovery of the gun and the report of the expert has not been disputed.	None
The question as to whether the First Information Report is an ante timed one or not must be considered having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case as has been opined by this Court in Meharaj Singh (L Nk.)	None
v State of U.P. (1994)	None
5 SCC 188 , whereupon Mr. Singh placed strong reliance.	None
Having perused the first information report, we are of the opinion that although the same was transcribed by P.W. 8 from the oral statement made by P.W. 1, it contained all the material particulars.	None
The very fact that it was recorded almost immediately after taking place of the occurrence, the question of its being an ante timed one would not arise.	None
In Chandu v State of Maharashtra (2002) 9 SCC 408 , whereupon again reliance has been placed by Mr. Singh, the High Court therein found the story of recovery of weapon of the offences as not believable.	None
Even there was a serious discrepancy in regard to the alleged weapon of offence used, as according to the eye witnesses, a spearblow had been given on the chest after the deceased struck against a cycle, whereas the medical evidence showed that the weapon must have entered the body from upward to downward laterally to right side, only on that basis the prosecution story was not believed.	None
Such is not the case here.	None
Reliance has also been placed on Gorle S. Naidu v State of A.P. and Others A.I.R. 2004 SC 1169 , wherein not only the eye witnesses who were said to have received injuries did not get themselves medically examined, the accused persons were also not specifically named during investigation.	None
The said decisions, therefore, are not applicable to the facts of the present case.	None
A defective investigation by itself cannot be a ground for acquittal.	None
Witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution have been believed both by the learned Trial Judge as also by the High Court.	None
So far as the appellant is concerned, we do not find any reason to differ therefrom.	None
For the reasons aforementioned, there is no merit in this appeal which is dismissed accordingly.	Decision
