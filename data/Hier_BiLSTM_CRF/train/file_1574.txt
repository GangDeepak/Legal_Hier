Before the High Court averments touching upon the lack of integrity and honesty on the part of the appellant were made by the writ petitioners.	None

QUESTIONS BEFORE THE HIGH COURT Before the High Court, the writ petitionersrespondents raised the following questions Whether the earlier recommendations of the Constitutional functionaries under Article 217, viz.	Facts
the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Chief Justice of India and the Collegium of the Supreme Court and of the Central Government that a person should not be considered as a Judge on grounds of unsuitability and as being public interest, are not vital and decisive considerations that should weigh with the Chief Justice of the High Court in considering the same person for appointment to any judicial office under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 or any other similar offices in other Tribunals Commissions ?	None
ii)	None
Since an independent and fair judiciary is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India, can a person found wanting in the necessary intellectual and moral requirements to be a Judge, be considered again for any other judicial office ?	None
iii)	None
If the Government considers and appoints such a person to any judicial office, would it not amount to interfering with the independence of the judiciary contrary to Article 50 of the Constitution of India ?	None
iv) Whether the expression is or has been a Judge of the High Court in Section 16 would include even a Judge, who had demitted office on account of impeachment or unsuitability to hold a judicial office ?	None
Whether an Additional Judge can be considered as a retired Judge to be eligible for appointment to judicial offices in various Tribunals and Commissions ?	None
The High Court inter alia formulated the following three questions for its consideration Whether Respondent No. 1 was ineligible to be appointed as the President of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission?(2) Whether the requirement of consultation with the Honourable the Chief Justice had been fulfilled ?	Facts
Whether the appointment of Respondent No. 1 can be declared illegal and invalid on the ground that such appointment was against public interest?	None
FINDINGS OF THE HIGH COURTRe Question No. 1 Upon considering a few decisions of this Court as also the provisions of the Constitution of India visvis Section 16 of the Act, the High Court held that having regard to the fact that an additional judge appointed for a period of two years can revert back to practice and would be entitled to appear before any court of law including the lower courts, there existed a distinction between a Permanent Judge and an Additional Judge.	Facts
Section 16 of the Act requires that the President of the Commission, be a person who is or has been a judge and accordingly an additional judge who has demitted office being not a retired judge, could not have been appointed.	Facts
Although a literal interpretation having regard to the decision of this Court S.P. Gupta v. Union of India 19822SCR365 may lead to the conclusion that an additional judge would be deemed to be a judge of the High Court for all purposes, in a case of the nature before it, the principle of purposive interpretation should be applied as it would indeed be a travesty of all canons of principles of jurisprudence if it is held, by adopting a cussedly narrow literal interpretation, that a person who was found by the appropriate Constitutional functionaries, which includes the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Collegium of the Supreme Court, unsuitable to be continued as an additional Judge yesterday, is eligible today for being appointed as adhoc Judge, for which only a retired Judge is eligible, on the specious plea, that the person has held the office of a Judge.	Facts
Re  Question No. 2	None
The High Court noticed that no affidavit has been filed by the Chief Justice of the High Court or on his behalf.	Facts
Upon taking into consideration the correspondences entered into by and between the State and the Registry leading to the sending of the panel by the Chief Justice, it was held Judged in the light of the discussion made earlier, the inevitable conclusion is that there has not been any effective consultation mainly on account of the fact that the Consultee, namely, the Honourable the Chief Justice has recommended the name of Respondent No. 1 without at all considering the background as available in the High Court records regarding the circumstances under which there was no extension of the term of Respondent No. 1.	Facts
It is no doubt true that this Court is neither required nor expected to consider the desirability of a person to be appointed for a particular post as that is a matter for the authorities concerned (in this case the State Government and the Honourable the Chief Justice) to consider.	Facts
But, where a decision itself is thickly clouded by non consideration of the most relevant and vital aspect, the ultimate appointment is vitiated not because the appointee is not desirable or otherwise, but because mandatory statutory requirement of consultation has not been rendered effectively and meaningfully.	None
therefore, even assuming that Respondent No. 1 was theoretically eligible for being considered, the process of consultation having been vitiated, the ultimate order is also vulnerable.	None
Re Question No. 3	None
The records produced by the Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Central Government and the learned Counsel for the High Court, despite the fact that no privilege had been claimed, the High Court did not think it fit to permit the counsel for the contesting parties to peruse the same as in its opinion it would open a collateral battle on the question relating to confirmation of Shri Kannadasan which was not and could not be an issue.	None
It was opined Indisputably the allegations made in the said writ petitions that Shri Kannadasan is not entitled to be considered for the post of the chairman of the commission would have to be accepted his tenure as additional judge and or appointed as a permanent judge, having not been confirmed, on the basis of the allegations touching upon his integrity and honestly.(B)	Facts
An additional judge who had demitted the office on the expiry of the term being not a permanent judge was ineligible for appointment in terms of Section 16 of the Act.(C) The recommendations.	Facts
made by the Chief Justice of the High Court is vitiated in law as before him all the relevant records relating to his non appointment as permanent judge and demission of office were not placed and thus the decision making process became vitiated.	None
On the basis of the said findings, Writ Petition No. 18731 of 2008 and Writ Petition No. 21504 of 2008 were allowed.	None
Writ Petition No. l2149 of 2008 for a declaration that the Full Court Reference dated 11.07.2008 was unconstitutional was, however, dismissed.	None
Government of Tamil Nadu and Shri Kannadasan are before us in these four appeals.	None
SUBMISSIONS Mr. K.K. Venugopal and Mr. U.U. Lalit, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants, inter alia, would contend Having regard to the constitutional scheme contained in Articles 216 to 224A of the Constitution of India, a permanent judge as also an additional judge would be a judge for all purposes including power salary remuneration judicial functions control over the subordinate judiciary etc.2.	Arguments of Petitioner
An Additional Judge does not cease to be a judge of the High Court only because he was not reappointed as a Permanent Judge thereof.3.	Arguments of Petitioner
As an Additional Judge of a High Court is not appointed on probation, the High Court committed a serious error in applying in the theory of confirmation in service which is foreign to the concept of appointment and status of a High Court judge.4.	Arguments of Petitioner
A writ of Quo Warranto could be issued only when a candidate does not specify the requisite eligibility criterion specified in the statute.5.	Arguments of Petitioner
Suitability or otherwise of a candidate appointed by the State in exercise of its statutory power cannot be a subject matter of judicial review, far less for the purpose of issuance of a writ of quo warraanto.6.	Arguments of Petitioner
The consultative process having been initiated by the Chief Justice of the High Court by recommending a panel of 3 names, the State was within its right to select any one of them as President of the Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
Recommendations of the Chief Justice of the High Court for appointment to a statutory post being discretionary and based on his subjective satisfaction, the High Court committed a serious error in opining that the Chief Justice should have called for the records files leading to Shri Kannadasans nonappointment as a permanent judge.7.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court itself having held that the records produced by the High Court and or the State could not have been shown to the writ petitioners as the suitability of Shri Kannadasan was not justiciable, committed a serious error in arriving at a different conclusion in regard to his eligibility in terms of the Constitution of India as also the 1984 Act relying on or on the basis of the purported records of his suitability.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Anil Diwan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the writ petitionersrespondents, on the other hand, urged The constitutional provisions make a distinction between a permanent judge and an additional judge who had not been made permanent for one reason or the other.ii) Section 16 of the Act while using the terms is or has been a judge could not have included within is purview an advocate who has been appointed only for two years and was not found fit for appointment as a permanent judge in view of the fact that independence and impartiality of the judiciary plays an important role in the matter of discharge of judicial functions.iii)	Arguments of Respondent
The State Commission being a judicial body and the eligibility criteria having been laid down in the Act, the Chief Justice of the High Court was obligated to take into consideration the past conduct, as also general reputation of the recommendee.iv) Only because a name of a judge has been included in the capacity as a retired judge and is entitled to medical benefits the same by itself would not be sufficient to answer the description of has been a judge within the meaning of the provisions of Section 16 of the Act.v) While taking an important decision like recommending the name of a retired judge who was not found fit to occupy the post of a permanent Judge, the Chief Justice was bound to take into consideration all relevant factors including the question of honesty and integrity of a judge which being a relevant statutory requirement, would determine the eligibility criteria, and thus a writ of quo warranto could be issued.	Arguments of Respondent

None
INTERPRETATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS IN REGARD TO THE STATUS OF AN ADDITIONAL JUDGE	None
The High Court has taken recourse to the rule of purposive construction whereas learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants want us to invoke the rule of literal meaning.	None
Interpretative tools of constitutional provisions and the statutory provisions may be different.	None
Whatever interpretative tool is applied, the Court must not forget that its job is to find out the intention of the legislature.	Reasoning
It can be gathered from the words used.	Reasoning
However, if plain meaning assigned to the section results in absurdity or anomaly, literal meaning indisputably would not be applied.	None
It is also well settled that the Court may have to change the interpretative tool in the event it is necessary to give effective contextual meaning to the Act.	None
It is one thing to say that an Additional Judge would be on the same pedestal as a Permanent Judge for all practical purposes, namely  judicial function administrative function pay and remuneration etc.	Reasoning
but would it mean that the same interpretation would be applicable even in a case where an Additional Judge despite his legitimate expectation to become a Permanent Judge has not been conferred on the said stating allegations of lack of probity.	Reasoning
An Additional Judge on the expiry of his tenure has a right to be considered for reappointment if he is not appointed as a Permanent Judge.	None
He may not, however, be reappointed if it is found that he is otherwise disqualified therefore, namely to satisfy the test of fitness and suitability, physical, intellectual and moral, before the Central Government can, consistently with its constitutional obligation and in public interest, decide to reappoint him as an Additional Judge or appoint him as a Permanent Judge.	Reasoning
SOME PRECEDENT P. GUPTA	None
In the context of Central Governments refusal to reappoint some additional judges as permanent judges, the Supreme Court in S.P. Gupta (supra) had the occasion to consider the said question.	None
Bhagwati, J. (as His Lordship then was) traced the history of appointment of ad hoc or temporary judges, the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1915 Section 220 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and the speech of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru expressing his firm opposition to the practice of appointing acting or Additional Judges to note that the drafting committee took the view that it was possible to discontinue the system of appointment of temporary and Additional Judges in the High Courts altogether by increasing, if necessary, the total number of permanent Judges of such Courts., to notice that the Constitutionmakers did not assume that an acting or Additional Judge would necessarily be made permanent and he would have to go back to the Bar.	None
The learned Judge furthermore noticed the enactment of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, in terms whereof existing Article 224 was substituted by a new Article and the existing Article 224 was added as new Article 224A thereafter.	None
It was held that the object clearly was that Additional Judge should be appointed for a short period in order to dispose of the temporary increase in the business of the High Court and or to clear off the arrears of pending cases.	None
The underlying idea was that there should be an adequate strength of permanent Judges in each High Court to deal with its normal institutions and so far as the temporary increase in the work or the arrears of pending cases were concerned, Additional Judges appointed for a period not exceeding two years should assist in disposing of such work.	None
Additional Judges while entering into the High Court judiciary had a legitimate expectation that they would not have to go back on the expiration of their term and that they would be either reappointed as Additional Judges for a further term or if in the meanwhile, a vacancy in the post of a permanent Judge became available, they would be confirmed as permanent Judges.	None
The Government, in view of the constitutional scheme, could not drop an additional Judge at its sweet will.	None
The expectation has been raised through a practice followed for almost over a quarter of a century.	None
The expression every Judge occurring in Article 217 must include not only a permanent Judge but also an Additional Judge.	None
The Additional Judge, on the expiry of his tenure, could not just be dropped without consideration (be of his reappointment or made a permanent judge).	None
As Additional Judge is entitled to be appointed without anything more, the process of selection in regard to his appointment need not be gone any further.	None
An Additional Judge is as much a Judge as a permanent Judge with the same jurisdiction and the same powers and to treat him as he were on probation, would not only detract from his status and dignity but also affect his independence by making his continuance as a Judge dependent on the good opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Governor of the State and the Chief Justice of India.	None
Although factors relevant for consideration of his appointment as permanent Judge have not been laid down having regard to the object and purpose of Article 217(1), it is obvious that fitness and suitability, physical, intellectual and moral, would be the governing considerations to be taken into account in deciding the question of appointment.	None
The Central Government, however, in view of the constitutional obligations, was, therefore, required to consider whether the Additional Judge is fit and suitable to be reappointed as an Additional Judge or appointed as a permanent Judge, as the case may be, must consider as to whether he is physically, intellectually or moral, unfit or unsuitable to be appointed as such.	Reasoning
Justice Fazal Ali, J. in his concurring judgment opined Thus, the position is that even if an Additional Judge is not appointed afresh and somebody else is appointed, there is no question of judicial review nor is there any question of the nonappointment of an Additional Judge afresh casting any reflection or aspersion on the reputation or character of an Additional Judge because he was appointed only for a particular period and for a particular purpose and is not on probation.	None
Both Brother Desai and Brother Venkataramiah, JJ. have stressed this aspect of the matter in their own way and I agree with their views.	None
SUPREME COURT ADVOCATESONRECORD ASSOCIATION This Court in Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Association and Ors.	None
v. Union of India AIR1994SC268 adopted a new approach opining that keeping in view the fact that independence of judiciary is one of the cardinal principles of constitution, the primacy of appointment shall be with the Chief Justice of India as also the Chief Justice of the High Court.	None
However, before making recommendations in terms of Articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution, they would have to consult two other senior most Judges who would be the members of the Collegium.	None
It was opined that S.P. Gupta (supra) should be read with Ashok Kumar Yadav v. State of Haryana AIR1987SC454 .	None
As regards justiciability of appointment and transfer it was laid down Except on the ground of want of consultation with the named constitutional functionaries or lack of any condition of eligibility in the case of an appointment, or of a transfer being made without the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India, these matters are not justiciable on any other ground, including that of bias, which in any case is excluded by the element of plurality in the process of decisionmaking.	None
SPECIAL REFERENCE In Re  Special Reference No. 1 of 1998, (1998) 7 SCC 739, in regard to justiciability of such power this Court held that having a plurality of judges in the formation of opinion provides sufficient safeguards and that they are sufficient checks against arbitrariness in the decision making process relating to Appointment and Transfers, stating The majority judgment ends with a summary of its conclusions.	None
Conclusions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 14 are relevant for our purposes.	None
They read thus(1)	None
The process of appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court and the High Courts is an integrated participatory consultative process for selecting the best and most suitable persons available for appointment and all the constitutional functionaries must perform this duty collectively with a view primarily to reach an agreed decision, subserving the constitutional purpose, so that the occasion of primacy does not arise.	None
(5) In exceptional cases alone, for stated strong cogent reasons, disclosed to the Chief Justice of India, indicating that the recommendee is not suitable for appointment, that appointment recommended by the Chief Justice of India may not be made.	None
However, if the stated reasons are not accepted by the Chief Justice of India and the other Judges of the Supreme Court who have been consulted in the matter, on reiteration of the recommendation by the Chief Justice of India, the appointment should be made as a healthy convention.	None
(10) In making all appointments and transfers, the norms indicated must be followed.	None
However, the same do not confer any justiciable right in anyone.(11)	None
Only limited judicial review on the grounds specified earlier is available in matters of appointments and transfers.	None
(14)	None
The majority opinion in S.P. Gupta v. Union of India insofar as it takes the contrary view relating to primacy of the role of the Chief Justice of India in matters of appointments and transfers, and the justiciability of these matters as well as in relation to Judgestrength, does not commend itself to us as being the correct view.	None
The relevant provisions of the Constitution including the constitutional scheme must now be construed, understood and implemented in the manner indicated herein by us.	None
It was furthermore held The questions posed by the Reference are now answered, but we should emphasise that the answers should be read in conjunction with the body of this opinion1.	None
The expression consultation with the Chief Justice of India in Articles 217(1) and 222(1) of the Constitution of India requires consultation with a plurality of Judges in the formation of the opinion of the Chief Justice of India.	None
The sole individual opinion of the Chief Justice of India does not constitute consultation within the meaning of the said articles.	None
4.	None
The Chief Justice of India is not entitled to act solely in his individual capacity, without consultation with other Judges of the Supreme Court, in respect of materials and information conveyed by the Government of India for nonappointment of a Judge recommended for appointment.	None
8.	None
The Chief Justice of India is obliged to comply with the norms and the requirement of the consultation process, as aforestated, in making his recommendations to the Government of India.	None
INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 16 OF THE ACT For this purpose, we will proceed on the basis that save and except for certain purposes an additional judge and a permanent judge enjoy equal status.	None
It could be said that for the purpose of appointment as Chairperson of some Tribunal, the name of an additional judge may also be taken into consideration but would that mean that an additional judge whose services were tainted or having regard to his general reputation or lack of integrity, wherefore he had not been made permanent as opposed to a situation where having regard to the policy decision of the Central Government or the purpose for which the additional judges are appointed to clear the back log is the question which falls for consideration.	Reasoning
This Court in T. Fenn Walter 2002SUPP1SCR134 laid down some broad guidelines as to the manner in which the appointment of a sitting Judge of a High Court to a Commission should be made.	Reasoning
In view of the said decision, it is expected that a sitting judge may not be recommended by the Chief Justice of the High Court for such appointment.	Reasoning
The words is or has been refer to the person holding the office of a Judge or who has held the said office.	Reasoning
It may be said to have the same meaning so far as eligibility is concerned.	Reasoning
Suitability of a person to be considered for appointment as a Chairman of a State Commission having regard to the provisions contained in Article 217 of the Constitution of India has been assumed by this Court to be available for the eligible persons who are retired Judges which would mean that those Judges who had retired from service without any blemish whatsoever and not merely a person who has been a judge.	None
See Ashish Handa v. The Honble the Chief Justice of High Court of Punjab and Haryana and Ors.19963SCR474 .	None
An Additional Judge holding a tenure post stricto sensu does not retire.	None
It is one thing to say that having regard to the constitutional embargo, he would not hold office after he attains the age of 62 years but it is another thing to say that for all other purposes, he can be equated with a sitting Judge.	None
There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that ordinarily a literal meaning should be given to the provisions of the Constitution as also a statute.	None
However, while applying the golden rules of literal interpretation one must be clear in his mind that same should not defeat the object and purpose for which the Act was enacted.	None
We could advert to this question a little later.	None
The jurisdiction of the consumer courts and particularly that of the State Commission and the National Commission is of great importance.	None
Various complicated questions of law and facts arise for their consideration.	None
It must, save and except for very cogent reasons refuse to entertain a claim application and ask the parties to agitate their grievances before a civil Court.	None
Indisputably, the functions of the Commission are judicial.	None
The State Commission, as noticed hereinbefore, not only exercises original jurisdiction but also appellate jurisdiction.	None
The guidelines clearly point out as to why, considering the basic feature of the Constitution, namely the independence of the judiciary, a sitting Judge must maintain the high traditions.	None
While a sitting Judge may be appointed to a statutory post or Tribunal, this Court as pointed out in T. Fenn Walter (supra) that he would not discharge the duties both as the Presiding Officer of a Judicial Tribunal and as a sitting Judge of the High Court.	None
An Additional Judge who has not been confirmed, may for the purpose of giving effect to the constitutional provisions be considered to be a former Judge but when it comes to the question of his appointment in the said capacity, in our opinion, it is possible to take somewhat different view having regard to his present status, viz., an advocate or a district judge, as the case may be.	None
He despite being a former Judge is entitled to practice in the same High Court, which other Judges are not permitted to do so.	None
He may appear before the Tribunal and subordinate courts.	None
A person for the aforementioned purpose must answer the test of his being qualified to be a Judge.	None
For the purpose of Section 16 of the Act, he must be equated with a sitting Judge of a High Court.	None
In other words, he could, but for the reasons like reaching the age of superannuation, continue as a Judge.	None
In S.P. Gupta (supra), this Court has categorically held that a person who has not been confirmed would not be recommended for reappointment.	None
If that be so, he could not continue to hold the High office of a Judge, although he was otherwise eligible therefore.	None
In Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Association (supra), this Court laid down the qualities of a Judge Under our constitutional scheme, the judiciary has been assigned the onerous task of safeguarding the fundamental rights of our citizens and of upholding the rule of law.	None
Since the Courts are entrusted the duty to uphold the Constitution and the laws, it very often comes in conflict with the State when it tries to enforce its orders by exacting obedience from recalcitrant or indifferent State agencies.	None
therefore, the need for an independent and impartial judiciary manned by persons of sterling quality and character, undaunting courage and determination and resolute impartiality and independence who would dispense justice without fear or favour, ill will or affection.	None
Justice without fear or favour, ill will or affection, is the cardinal creed of our Constitution and a solemn assurance of every Judge to the people of this great country.	None
There can be no two opinions at the Bar that an independent and impartial judiciary is the most essential characteristic of a free society.	None
A Judge must have these basic qualities and, thus, must be found to possess the same.	None
A person found to be lacking these qualities would not be recommended for appointment of a permanent judge.	None
The system of governance established by the Constitution is based on distribution of powers and functions amongst the three organs of the State.	None
It is the prerogative of the Legislature to enact laws responsibility of the Executive to enforce the laws and administer the country and the duty of the Judiciary to adjudicate upon the disputes that arise between individuals, between an individual the State or between different States.	None
In this scheme of things, Supreme Court has been assigned the duty of being the final arbiter, including on the question of interpretation of the Constitution the laws.	None
It is the majesty of the institution that has to be maintained and preserved in the larger interest of the rule of law by which we are governed.	None
It is the obligation of each organ of the State to support this important institution.	None
Judiciary holds a central stage in promoting and strengthening democracy, human rights and rule of law.	None
Peoples faith is the very foundation of any judiciary.	None
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere and therefore the Peoples faith in the Judiciary cannot be afforded to be eroded.	None
Independence of judiciary is a much wider concept.	None
Key note is judiciary and not the Judge.	None
If a person does not have qualification for continuing to hold the office of the Judge of a High Court, it is difficult to conceive as to how despite such deficiency in qualification, he could be recommended for appointment to a statutory post, the eligibility criteria wherefore is inter alia a former Judge.	None
A Chief Justice of a High Court, thus, before making recommendations for his appointment in terms of Section 16 of the Act must satisfy himself that the recommendee has had those basic qualities.	None
While making recommendations the Chief Justice performs a constitutional duty.	None
If while discharging his duty, he finds a former judge to be ineligible, the question of his being considered for appointment would not arise.	None
If such a person cannot be recommended being unfit or ineligible to hold the post, it would not be correct to contend that despite the same he fulfils the eligibility criteria.	None
Whether the condition has been a judge is not necessary to be construed for the purpose of Article 217 of the Constitution of India, it is required for the purpose of interpreting Section 16 of the Act as to whether he should be recommended for being appointed as a Chairman of the state commission.	None
In our constitutional scheme, the judge made law becomes a part of the Constitution.	None
It has been so held in M. Nagaraj and Ors.	None
v. Union of India and Ors.	None
AIR2007SC71 in the following terms The Constitution, according to the respondents, is not merely what it says.	None
It is what the last interpretation of the relevant provision of the Constitution given by the Supreme Court which prevails as a law.	None
The interpretation placed on the Constitution by the Court becomes part of the Constitution and, therefore, it is open to amendment under Article 368.	None
An interpretation placed by the Court on any provision of the Constitution gets inbuilt in the provisions interpreted.	None
Such articles are capable of amendment under Article 368.	None
If a person has made himself disqualified to hold the post of a judge, the Chief Justice should not consider his name at all.	None
If a duty had been cast on the Chief Justice not to recommend, which is a constitutional duty for all intent and purpose  he must be held to be disqualified.	None
If he stands disqualified following S.P. Gupta (supra) and other cases question of his candidature being considered does not arise.	None
It is in that sense  the principle of purposive construction is to be taken recourse to.	None
If the Collegium of the Supreme Court Judges including the Chief Justice of India, which is a constitutional authority in the matter of appointment of Judges and reappointment of Additional Judges did not find him eligible, it would be beyond anybodys comprehension as to how Chief Justice of a High Court could find him eligible suitable for holding a statutory post requiring possession of qualification of holder of a constitutional office.	None
If no recommendation by the Chief Justice is constitutionally permissible, the question of the eligibility criteria being not satisfied certainly is relevant.	None
Question is not whether he is a former judge or not.	None
Question is whether he was eligible for appointment, having not been found fit for re appointment.	None
If he was ineligible for being recommended, that is the end of the matter.	None
PURPOSIVE INTERPRETATION A case of this nature is a matter of moment.	None
It concerns public interest.	None
Public information about independence and impartiality of a judiciary would be in question.	None
The duty of all organs of the State is that the public trust and confidence in the judiciary may not go in vain.	None
Construction of a statute would not necessarily depend upon application of any known formalism.	None
It must be done having regard to the text and context thereof.	None
For the aforementioned purpose, it is necessary to take into consideration the statutory scheme and the purpose and object it seeks to achieve.	None
A construction of a statute, as is well known, must subserve the tests of justice and reason.	None
It is a wellsettled principle of law that in a given case with a view to give complete and effective meaning to a statutory provision, some words can be read into some words can be subtracted.	None
Provisions of a statute can be read down (although sparingly and rarely).	None
In Carew and Company Ltd. v. Union of India 19761SCR379 , Krishna Iyer, J. opined The law is not a brooding omnipotence in the sky but a pragmatic instrument of social order.	None
It is an operational art controlling economic life, and interpretative effort must be imbued with the statutory purpose.	None
No doubt, grammar is a good guide to meaning but a bad master to dictate.	None
Notwithstanding the traditional view that grammatical construction is the golden rule, Justice Frankfurter used words of practical wisdom when he observed There is no surer way to misread a document than to read it literally.	None
Yet Again in K.P. Varghese v. Income Tax Officer, Ernakulam and Anr 1981131ITR597(SC) , the strict literal reading of a statute was avoided as by reason thereof several vital considerations, which must always be borne in mind, would be ignored, stating The task of interpretation of a statutory enactment is not a mechanical task.	None
It is more than a mere reading of mathematical formulae because few words possess the precision of mathematical symbols.	None
It is an attempt to discover the intent of the legislature from the language used by it and it must always be remembered that language is at best an imperfect instrument for the expression of human thought and as pointed out by Lord Denning, it would be idle to expect every statutory provision to be drafted with divine prescience and perfect clarity.	None
We can do no better than repeat the famous words of Judge Learned Hand when he laidit is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary and ordinarily the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning of any writing be it a statute, a contract or anything else.	None
But it is one of the surest indexes of a mature and developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress out of the dictionary but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaningthe meaning of a sentence may be more than that of the separate words, as a melody is more than the notes, and no degree of particularity can ever obviate recourse to the setting in which all appear, and which all collectively create.	None
In the aforementioned case, therefore, some words were read into and the plain and natural construction was not given.	None
In Bhudan Singh and Anr.	None
v. Nabi Bux and Anr.	None
19702SCR10 , this Court held The object of every legislation is to advance public welfare.	None
In other words as observed by Crawford in his book on Statutory Constructions that the entire legislative process is influenced by considerations of justice and reason.	None
Justice and reason constitute the great general legislative intent in every peace of legislation.	None
Consequently where the suggested construction operates harshly, ridiculously or in any other manner contrary to prevailing conceptions of justice and reason, in most instance, it would seem that the apparent or suggested meaning of the statute, was not the one intended by the law makers.	None
In the absence of some other indication that the harsh or ridiculous effect was actually intended by the legislature, there is little reason to believe that it represents the legislative intent.	None
This Court Atma Ram Mittal v. Ishwar Singh Punia (1994)IIILLJ972SC Judicial time and energy is more often than not consumed in finding what is the intention of Parliament or in other words, the will of the people.	None
Blackstone tells us that the fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the legislator is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law was made, by signs most natural and probable.	None
And these signs are either the words, the context, the subjectmatter, the effects and consequence, or the spirit and reason of the law.	None

this Court noticed (SCC p. 366, paras 2526)25.	None
In regard to purposive interpretation, Justice Frankfurter observed as follows Legislation has an aim, it seeks to obviate some mischief, to supply an inadequacy, to effect a change of policy, to formulate a plan of Government.	None
That aim, that policy is not drawn, like nitrogen, out of the air it is evidenced in the language of the statute, as read in the light of other external manifestations of purpose Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Columbia LR 527, at p. 538	None
(1947).x x x38.	None
In The Interpretation and Application of Statutes by Reed Dickerson, the author at p. 135 has discussed the subject while dealing with the importance of context of the statute in the following termsThe essence of the language is to reflect, express, and perhaps even affect the conceptual matrix of established ideas and values that identifies the culture to which it belongs.	None
For this reason, language has been called conceptual map of human experience.	None
In New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadia and Anr.	None
AIR2008SC876 , this Court held Barak in his exhaustive work on Purposive Construction explains various meanings attributed to the term purpose.	None
It would be in the fitness of discussion to refer to Purposive Construction in Baraks wordsHart and Sachs also appear to treat purpose as a subjective concept.	None
I say appear because, although Hart and Sachs claim that the interpreter should imagine himself or herself in the legislators shoes, they introduce two elements of objectivity First, the interpreter should assume that the legislature is composed of reasonable people seeking to achieve reasonable goals in a reasonable manner and second, the interpreter should accept the nonrebuttable presumption that members of the legislative body sought to fulfil their constitutional duties in good faith.	None
This formulation allows the interpreter to inquire not into the subjective intent of the author, but rather the intent the author would have had, had he or she acted reasonably.(Aharon Barak, Purposive Interpretation in Law, (2007) at p.87.)	None
In Union of India v. Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited and Ors. AIR2008SC2286 , this Court held that the principles of purposive construction may be employed for making an exemption notification a workable one.	None
We may notice that in Regina v. Secretary of State for Health ex parate Quintavalle 2003 UKHL 13, the House of Lords stated the law as under The basic task of the court is to ascertain and give effect to the true meaning of what Parliament has said in the enactment to be construed.	None
But that is not to say that attention should be confined and a literal interpretation given to the particular provisions which give rise to difficulty.	None
Such an approach not only encourages immense prolixity in drafting, since the draftsman will feel obliged to provide expressly for every contingency which may possibly arise.	None
It may also (under the banner of loyalty to the will of Parliament) lead to the frustration of that will, because undue concentration on the minutiae of the enactment may lead the court to neglect the purpose which Parliament intended to achieve when it enacted the statute.	None
Every statute other than a pure consolidating statute is, after all, enacted to make some change, or address some problem, or remove some blemish, or effect some improvement in the national life.	None
The courts task, within the permissible bounds of interpretation, is to give effect to Parliaments purpose.	None
So the controversial provisions should be read in the context of the statute as a whole, and the statute as a whole should be read in the historical context of the situation which led to its enactment.	None
The pendulum has swung towards purposive methods of construction.	None
This change was not initiated by the teleological approach of European Community jurisprudence, and the influence of European legal culture generally, but it has been accelerated by European ideas see, however, a classic early statement of the purposive approach by Lord Blackburn in River Wear Commissioners v Adamson (1877) 2 App Cas 743, 763.	None
In any event, nowadays the shift towards purposive interpretation is not in doubt.	None
Yet again, the Australian High Court in Australian Finance Direct Limited v. Director of Consumer Affairs Victoria 2007 HCA 57, held This explanation of the approach to be taken to a problem of construction has been cited, restated and applied in this Court so many times that it should be uncontroversial.	None
Some judges have not been sympathetic to the purposive approach39.	None
Some have clearly yearned for a return to the perceived simplicities of literalism, either generally or in particular fields of law.	None
On the whole, however, this Court has adhered to the doctrinal shift with a fair degree of consistency.	None
In my view, there is a need for such consistency.	None
We should avoid opportunistic reversions to the old approach of literalism which the legal mind sometimes finds congenial.41.	None
Obviously, a balance must be struck between, on the one hand, an exclusive focus on the text of legislation and, on the other, reference to extrinsic information that assists to explain its purpose.	None
Those bound by the law will often have no access to such information.	None
Cases do arise where the legal prescription is relatively clear on the face of the written law.	None
To the extent that external inquiries are necessary, they obviously add to marginal costs and can sometimes occasion disputes and uncertainty which the words of the law alone would not have produced.	None
Mr. Venugopal would, however, place strong reliance on Harbhajan Singh v. Press Council of India and Ors.	None
20022SCR369 to emphasise that the golden rule is that the words of statute must be prima facie given their ordinary meaning.	None
In that case, itself, this Court has referred to the Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh wherein it has been stated that the Judges can adopt a purposive interpretation if they can find in a statute read as a whole or in material to which they are permitted by law to refer as aids to interpretation an expression of Parliaments purpose or policy.	None
Although ordinarily, an ordinary meaning cannot be departed from by the Judges in the light of their own views as to policy.	None
Eligibility of a Judge of a High Court should not be construed in a pedantic manner.	None
It in the context of a large number of decisions of this Court including S.P. Gupta (supra) must also be held to include suitability of a person concerned.	None
For the aforementioned purpose, the principles of purposive interpretation is required to be resorted to.	None
Reliance has also been placed on Sangeeta Singh v. Union of India and Ors. AIR2005SC4459	None
wherein also while dealing to principles of construction, it was clearly stated It is a wellsettled principle in law that the court cannot read anything into a statutory provision or a stipulated condition which is plain and unambiguous.	None
A statute is an edict of the legislature.	None
The language employed in a statute is the determinative factor of legislative intent.	None
Similar is the position for conditions stipulated in advertisements.	None
PRECEDENTS GOVERNING APPOINTMENT OF CHAIRMAN, STATE COMMISSION.	None
The question in regard to the appointment of a former Judge of the High Court as the President of the State Commission has been considered by this Court in Ashish Handa v. The Honble the Chief Justice of High Court of Punjab and Haryana and Ors.	None
(supra) wherein it was opined The scheme is that these three agencies constituted for redressal of consumer disputes at different levels have as its President a person who is, or has been a Judge at the corresponding level.	None
This is so because the function of these agencies is primarily the adjudication of consumer disputes and, therefore, a person from the judicial branch is considered to be suitable for the office of the President.	None
The appointment to the office of the President of the State Commission is to be made only after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court and to the office of the President of the National Commission after consultation with the Chief Justice of India.	None
Such a provision requiring prior consultation with the Chief Justice is obviously for the reason that he is the most suitable person to know about the suitability of the person to be appointed as the President of the CommissionThe expression after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court and after consultation with the Chief Justice of India must be construed in the same manner as the expression after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Justice of the High Court in Article 217 of the Constitution of India made in Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Assn. v. Union of India.	None
Accordingly, the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court and the requirement of consultation with him according to the proviso in Section 16(1)(a) must have the same status as that of the Chief Justice of the High Court in the appointment of a High Court Judge under Article 217 of the Constitution of India and the process of appointment to the office of the President of the State Commission must also be similar.	None
It is unnecessary to restate the same which is summarised in the majority opinion in the JudgesII case.	None
This is necessary to maintain independence of the judiciary and to avoid any possibility of a sitting or a retired Judge depending on the executive for such an appointment The requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice in the proviso to Section 16(1)(a) and Section 20(1)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act being similar to that in Article 217, the principles enunciated in the majority opinion in the JudgesII case must apply, as indicated earlier, even for initiating the proposal.	None
The executive is expected to approach the Chief Justice when the appointment is to be made for taking the steps to initiate the proposal, and the procedure followed should be the same as for appointment of a High Court Judge.	Reasoning
That would give greater credibility to the appointment made.	Reasoning
Yet again in Ashok Tanwar and Anr.	None
v. State of Himachal Pradesh and Ors.	None
AIR2005SC614 this Court held A person to be appointed as President of the State Commission has to be necessarily a sitting or a retired Judge of a High Court and not that any person can be appointed as President of the State Commission.	None
This being the position, it does not stand to reason as to why again in respect of a sitting or retired Judge of a High Court the whole process contemplated under Article 217 of the Constitution must be resorted to.	None
To put in clear terms so as to remove any doubt, we state that in the matter of appointment of a sitting or retired Judge of a High Court as President of the State Commission, process must be initiated by the Chief Justice under Section 16 of the Act and consultation contemplated in the said section is consultation only with the Chief Justice of the High Court and not with the collegium.(emphasis added)	Reasoning
The Constitution Bench in Ashok Tanwar, however, clearly held that the consultation process in terms of Article 217 of the the Constitution of India, for the purpose of finding out of the suitability or otherwise of the candidate, namely the members of the Collegium is not necessary.	None
Such a finding was arrived at inter alia on the premise that an appointment was required to be made by a sitting or a retired judge whose antecedents are known to the Chief Justice stating It is thus clear that the expression consultation used in Article 217 of the Constitution in relation to appointment of High Court Judges cannot be read in the same way into consultation as contemplated under Section 16 of the Act in the light of what is stated above in Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Assn.	None
The meaning of the word consultation must be given in the context of an enactment.	None
If the argument that the consultation process in regard to appointment of a Judge or retired Judge of the High Court to the State Commission under Section 16 must be in the same manner as required under Article 217 of the Constitution is accepted, it will lead to anomalous situation.	None
Under Article 217(1) of the Constitution, consultation contemplated with constitutional functionaries mentioned therein is for the purpose of appointment of a Judge of a High Court and not for appointment of a person as the President of the State Commission under Section 16 of the Act.	None
If the consultation to be made for appointment of a person as President of the State Commission, as required under Section 16 of the Act, is to be similar as under Article 217 of the Constitution, then, even in case of appointment of a retired Judge as President of the State Commission, such consultation has to be made with all constitutional functionaries, which does not stand to reason.	None
Hence, obviously for appointment of a person as President of the State Commission, consultation as required under Article 217 of the Constitution as against the requirement stated in Section 16 of the Act is not necessary.	None
If that be so, not only the opinion of two senior most Judges of the High Court should be obtained but also the consultation should be made with other constitutional functionaries as contemplated under Article 217 of the Constitution including the Chief Justice of India.	None
Hence insistence on consultation by the Chief Justice of a High Court with his two senior most colleagues in the High Court for the purpose of Section 16 of the Act, in our view, is unwarranted.	None
CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION Independence and impartiality of judiciary is a basic feature of the Constitution.	None
Constitutionalism envisages that all laws including the constitutional provisions should be interpreted so as to uphold the basic feature of the Constitution.	Reasoning
A person lacking probity would not be a person who could be found fit for appointment as a High Court Judge.	Reasoning
A case of this nature where no reappointment was made or an Additional Judge despite existence of vacancy was not made a Permanent Judge, in our opinion, deserves serious consideration.	Reasoning
It is not a case where reappointment as an Additional Judge or appointment to a Permanent Judge was not possible for want of vacancy or the purpose for which such appointments had been made was achieved.	Reasoning
An Additional Judge may not be made permanent or reappointed in the said capacity if If the requirement contemplated under Article 224 no longer exists (b) He had attained the age of 62 years (c) He is not inclined to continue further (d)	Reasoning
His inability to continue further on account of physical or mental capacity In S.P. Gupta (supra) a Seven Judge Bench of this Court has clearly held that every reappointment should undergo the same processes as envisaged under Article 217 of the Constitution of India.	None
We are although not oblivious of a decision of the Division Bench of this Court in Shanti Bhushan and Anr.	Reasoning
v. Union of India and Anr. 2009(234)ELT9(SC)	None
wherein it has been held that extension of the tenure of an Additional Judge is the prerogative of the Chief Justice of India but therein this Court was not concerned with a situation of this nature.	Reasoning
In this case the collegium have found him unfit to continue as a Judge.	None
We have gone through the records produced before us.	Reasoning
We are satisfied that for good and sufficient reasons, he was found not fit to be recommended for appointment as a Permanent Judge.	Reasoning
We say no more being wholly unnecessary.	Reasoning
An Additional Judge who had not been made permanent, technically, could be appointed as an acting or Additional Judge but then the question which was required to be asked was should a person who had not been found fit be so appointed?	Reasoning
The answer to the aforementioned question clearly would a big emphatic no.	None
Before us both the High Court as also the Union of India have produced records in relation whereto the High Court, stated The learned Counsel sought leave of this Court to wade through the entire file containing the correspondence and the discussions touching upon the question of confirmation of the Respondent No. 1.	None
Even though all such papers have been made available to us by the Addl.	None
Solicitor General appearing for the Central Government and Shri Muthukumarasamy, Senior Counsel, for the High Court and no privilege has been claimed, we have not thought it fit to permit the Counsels for the contesting parties to peruse such papers, because, in our considered opinion, it would open a collateral battle on the question relating to confirmation of Respondent No. 1, which is not and cannot be an issue.	None
Moreover, it is not for us to decide about the suitability of Respondent No. 1 for the post of President of the Consumer Commission as that was a matter for the State Government to decide in consultation with the Chief Justice.	None
If the appointment of a person is otherwise legal, the Judiciary may not be justified in interfering with such appointment on the ground that it is against public interest.	None
As already noticed, the sentiment expressed in R.K. Jain case is clear on this aspect.	None
We have perused the records ourselves.	None
We are satisfied that it was necessary for the Chief Justice of the High Court to apprise himself the reasons with reference to the backdrop of events as to why the collegium of the Supreme Court of India did not find the appellant to be a fit person for reappointment or made a Permanent Judge.	Reasoning
Names of eight persons were recommended together.	Reasoning
A large number of vacancies existed.	Reasoning
Six of them were recommended to be appointed as Permanent Judges.	Reasoning
In respect of one name, the Chief Justice of India exercised his prerogative jurisdiction to extend his term from time to time.	Reasoning
He had also been made a Permanent Judge.	Reasoning
See Shanti Bhushan (supra) Only in relation to the appellant herein the collegium refused to make a recommendation which was also accepted by the Chief Justice of India.	None
We may also place on record that at least in a few decisions, this Court has held that only a sitting or retired Judge is suitable for appointment.	None
In our opinion, the same clearly goes to show that Judge whose tenure ended by way of non extension as a stigma would not come within the purview of the definition of term has been a Judge of the High Court.	Reasoning
We say so for more than one reason.	None
Section 16(1)(b)(iii) of the Act in relation to appointment of a Member of the Commission lays down inter alia	Reasoning
the qualifications of a person of ability, integrity and standing.	Reasoning
If in the case of a Member, ability, integrity and standing are essential qualifications, it is difficult to perceive why the same qualification is not required for appointment as Chairman of the Commission within the meaning of Clause (a) thereof.	Reasoning
The said criteria was not necessary to be expressly stated as the same could be presumed as recommendation in that behalf, to be made by the Chief Justice of a High Court.	None
It is also of some significance to notice that in the matter of appointment of the Fast Track Court Judges, this Court in Brij Mohan Lal v. Union of India 20023SCR810 , observed as under We find substance in the stand taken by the learned Counsel who have highlighted the non desirability of appointing judicial officers who did not carry good reputation so far as their honesty and integrity is concerned.	None
It is to be noted that in All India Judges Assn. v. Union of India and in All India Judges Assn. v. Union of India this Court took note of the nondesirability to grant the benefit of two years extension in service i.e. from 58 years to 60 years in the case of officers who were not found to be of continued utility.	None
In each case an evaluation of the service records was directed to be undertaken to find out whether the officer has or lacks potentiality for getting such benefit.	None
As regards the qualifications of a Fast Track Court Judges, keeping in view the laudable object with which the Scheme had been conceived and introduced, inter alia the following directions were issued The second preference in appointments to Fast Track Courts shall be given to retired judges who have good service records with no adverse comments in their ACRs, so far as judicial acumen, reputation regarding honesty, integrity and character are concerned.	None
Those who were not given the benefit of two years extension of the age of superannuation, shall not be considered for appointment.	None
It should be ensured that they satisfy the conditions laid down in Articles 233(2) and 309 of the Constitution.	None
The High Court concerned shall take a decision with regard to the minimum maximum age of eligibility to ensure that they are physically fit for the work in Fast Track Courts.3.	None
No judicial officer who was dismissed or removed or compulsorily retired or made to seek retirement shall be considered for appointment under the Scheme.	None
Judicial officers who have sought voluntary retirement after initiation of departmental proceedings inquiry shall not be considered for appointment.	None
In Pareena Swarup v. Union of India 2008(231)ELT210(SC) , this Court intervened stating legislative amendments are carried out to protect judicial independence in a case involving the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.	None
Qualification to hold the post was found to be necessary also in B.R. Kapur v. State of T.N. and Anr.	None
CONSULTATION We may consider as to whether the consultative process required to be gone into for the purpose of appointment of Chairman, State Commission was complied with.	None
The word consultation may mean differently in different situations depending on the nature and purport of the statute.	None
Consultation, although in regard to the appointment of the High Court and the Supreme Court Judges, having regard to the decision of this Court in Supreme Court Advocateson Record Association (supra) would mean concurrence, should it for the purpose of the provisions of Section 16 mean differently is the question.	None
Indisputably, in view of the decisions of this Court in Ashok Tanwar (supra) and Ashish Handa (supra) consultation with the Chief Justice would not mean the consultation with the Collegium of the High Court.	None
Concedingly again, proposal for such appointment must be initiated by the Chief Justice.	None
The manner of initiation of proposal for consultation need not be as laid down in Ashish Handa (supra) but as laid down in Ashok Tanwar (supra) wherein it was clearly laid down that the manner of initiation of proposal must remain the same throughout as the law in this behalf is quite well settled and the Bench was felt bound by the same.	None
In State of Haryana and Ors.	None
v. National Consumer Awareness Group and Ors.AIR2005SC2356	None
this Court did not give a literal meaning to Subsection (1A) of Section 16 to hold that both Subsection 1(a) and (1A) of Section 16 must be harmoniously construed, stating The learned Counsel, alternatively, argued that the scheme contemplated by Subsection (1A) is quite workable even in a situation where there exists already a President, but the question arises of his reappointment which would make him unable to act as Chairman of the Selection Committee.	None
In such cases, a sitting Judge of the High Court could be nominated by the Chief Justice of the High Court to act as a Chairman.	None
Even this argument does not commend itself to us.	None
A literal reading of Subsection (1A) may prima facie suggest that appointments under clauses (a) and (b) of Subsection (1) are also governed by the procedure contemplated therein, under Subsection (1A), but as rightly held by the High Court the two Subsections have to be harmoniously construed.	None
The procedure contemplated under Subsection (1A) can apply only in respect of appointment of members falling within the contemplation of Clause (b) of Subsection (1) of Section 16.	None
In our view, the High Court has given adequate and justifiable reasons for this interpretation with which we agree.	None
The interpretation given by the circular, and the view taken by the Union of India in the matter of Section 16(1A), is incorrect and we hold that the procedure contemplated therein applies only to the appointments made under Clause (b) of Subsection (1) of Section 16.	None
While approving Ashish Handa (supra) and Ashok Tanwar (supra) it was observed A careful reading of Ashok Tanwar shows that the Constitution Bench differed from Ashish Handa only on the issue whether consultation with the Chief Justice meant consultation with the collegium of the High Court.	None
In other respects, Ashish Handa is approved.	None
This Court in S.P. Gupta (supra) opined that the principles as regards consultation for appointment of Judges in terms of Article 217 of the Constitution of India would be the same as laid down in State of Gujarat v.	None
Sankalchand Khodidas Patel 19782SCR178 and other cases, stating The word consult implies a conference of two or more persons or an impact of two or more minds in respect of a topic in order to enable them to evolve a correct or at least a satisfactory solution and added In order that the two minds may be able to confer and produce a mutual impact, it is essential that each must have for its consideration full and identical facts, which can at once constitute both the source and foundation of the final decision.	None
Krishna Iyer, J. speaking on behalf of himself and Fazal Ali, J. also pointed out that all the materials in the possession of one who consults must be unreservedly placed before the consultee and further a reasonable opportunity for getting information, taking other steps and getting prepared for tendering effective and meaningful advice must be given to him and the consultant in turn must take the matter seriously since the subject is of grave importance (SCC p. 267).	None
The learned Judge proceeded to add (SCC p. 267) therefore, it follows that the President must communicate to the Chief Justice all the material he has and the course he proposes.	None
The Chief Justice, in turn, must collect necessary information through responsible channels or directly, acquaint himself with the requisite data, deliberate on the information he possesses and proceed in the interests of the administration of justice to give the President such counsel of action as he thinks will further the public interest, especially the cause of the justice system.	None
These observations apply with equal force to determine the scope and meaning of consultation within the meaning of Clause (2) of Article 124 and Clause (1) of Article 217.	None
Each of the constitutional functionaries required to be consulted under these two articles must have for his consideration full and identical facts bearing upon appointment or nonappointment of the person concerned as a Judge and the opinion of each of them taken on identical material must be considered by the Central Government before it takes a decision whether or not to appoint the person concerned as a Judge.	None
In regard to the position of the Additional Judges, it was clearly held that same process must be followed.	None
Fazal Ali, J. in his concurrent judgment noticed Union of India v. Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth 19781SCR423 wherein it was opined that for purposeful consideration of a matter, the President while consulting the Chief Justice must make the relevant data available to him, stating If the facts necessary to arrive at a proper conclusion are not made available to the Chief Justice, he must ask for them because, in casting on the President the obligation to consult the Chief Justice, the Constitution at the same time must be taken to have imposed a duty on the Chief Justice to express his opinion on nothing less than a full consideration of the matter on which he is entitled to be consulted.	None
The fulfilment by the President, of his constitutional obligation to place full facts before the Chief Justice and the performance by the latter, of the duty to elicit facts which are necessary to arrive at a proper conclusion are parts of the same process and are complementary to each other.	None
The faithful observance of these may well earn a handsome dividend useful to the administration of justice.	None
Consultation within the meaning of Article 222(1), therefore, means full and effective, not formal or unproductive consultation.	None
It was held that both consultor and consultee must have before them full and identical facts.	None
The source of foundation therefore must also be the same.	None
It was opined that if the Chief Justice of India had not been consulted fully, purposeful, effectively and was not informed about all the relevant facts, the same would render an order of transfer unconstitutional.	None
What would be the necessary concomitants of an effective consultation was stated thus in SP Gupta (supra) If the consultation with the C.J.I. has not been done before transferring a judge, the transfer becomes unconstitutional.	None
(5) The fulfilment by the President of his constitutional obligation and performance of his duty by the C.J.I. are parts of the same process and after this process is fully complied with, the consultation becomes full and effective and not formal or unproductive.	None
(7) After the data, facts or materials are placed before the consulate and the consultee, there should be a full and complete application of minds in respect of the subject to enable them to reach a satisfactory conclusion.	None
In other words, the two minds must be able to confer and produce a mutual impact on the identical facts which would constitute both the source and the foundation of the final decision.(8)	None
The C.J.I. owes a corresponding duty both to the President and to the Judge who is proposed to be transferred to consider every relevant fact before tendering his opinion to the President.	None
Appointment to the post of President of a State Commission must satisfy not only the eligibility criteria of the candidate but also undertaking of the process of consultation.	None
Keeping in mind the aforementioned legal scenario the question as to whether the consultative process had been gone into, must be considered.	None
Indisputably, the decision by the Chief Justice must be an informed one with respect to the post of a Chairman of a State Commission, keeping in view the importance thereof having regard to the fact that the Commission is required to perform judicial functions, both the Chief Justice as also the State Government were required to be duly informed about the person who is going to be appointed.	Reasoning
With a view to fulfill the constitutional obligations as to whether he is a fit person, it is absolutely essential that all relevant information should be placed before the consultor as also the consultee.	Reasoning
As far as the proviso appended to Section 16 of the Act is concerned, keeping in view the constitutional post held by a Chief Justice, there cannot be an iota of doubt that the recommendations made by him shall carry great weight.	Reasoning
Save and except for very cogent reasons, his recommendation must be accepted.	None
The Constitution Bench of this Court in Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Association (supra) and in the Presidential Reference, Special Reference No. 1 of 1998 (supra) laid down the law that consultation would mean concurrence wherefore the primacy has been shifted to the Collegium which provision in turn being applicable to the case of appointment of a Chairman of a State Commission in terms of Section 16 of the Act, save and except for the difference that recommendation, instead and in place of the Collegium, would be that of the Chief Justice alone.	Reasoning
We have no doubt in our mind that he is bound to take into consideration all facts relevant therefore and must eschew irrelevant facts.	None
As suitability of a person, in view of S.P. Gupta (supra), depends upon several factors which are necessary to be considered for reappointment and or making Additional Judge a permanent one, there does not exist any reason whatsoever why the same shall not be considered to be a relevant factor for recommending the name of a person who would hold such a high office.	Reasoning
It has not been denied or disputed that for one reason or the other the Chief Justice of the High Court did not have the occasion to go through the said file.	Reasoning
The Original record maintained by the High Court as also by the Central Government had been placed before the High Court as also before us.	Reasoning
The superior courts must take into consideration as to what is good for the judiciary as an institution and not for the judge himself.	None
An act of balancing between public interest and private interest must be made.	Reasoning
Thus, institution as also public interest must be uppermost in the mind of the court.	Reasoning
When such factors are to be taken into consideration, the court may not insist upon a proof.	Reasoning
It would not delve deep into the allegations.	Reasoning
The court must bear in mind the limitations in arriving at a finding in regard to lack of integrity against the person concerned.	Reasoning
As has been noticed in S.P. Gupta (supra), the test which must be applied for the purpose of assessing the suitability of a person for appointment as a Judge must be whether the Chief Justice of the High Court or for the matter of that, any other constitutional authority concerned in the appointment is satisfied about the integrity of the person under consideration and, thus, if he does not enjoy good reputation, it would not be possible for the Chief Justice of the High Court to say that he is satisfied about the integrity of such person and in such an event he would be justified in not recommending him for appointment and in fact it would be his duty not to recommend his name.	Reasoning
We may notice that recently a Division Bench of this Court of which one of us (Dr. Justice Mukundakam Sharma) was a member in Shanti Bhushan and Anr.	None
v. Union of India and Anr.	None
(supra) referring to S.P. Gupta (supra), Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Association (supra) and other decisions, noticed Pathak, J (as the Honble Judge then was) had expressed similar opinion by observing that in following the procedure of Article 217(1) while appointing an Additional Judge as a Permanent Judge there would be reduced emphasis with which the consideration would be exercised though the process involves the consideration of all the concomitant elements and factors which entered into the process of consultation at the time of appointment earlier as an additional Judge.	None
The position was succinctly stated by observing that there is a presumption that a person found suitable for appointment as an Additional Judge continues to be suitable for appointment as a Permanent Judge, except when circumstances or events arise which bear adversely on the mental and physical capacity, character and integrity or other matters rendering it unwise to appoint him as a permanent Judge.	None
There must be relevant and pertinent material to sufficiently convince a reasonable mind that the person is no longer suitable to fill the high office of a Judge and has forfeited his right to be considered for appointment.	None
It was furthermore opined As rightly submitted by learned Counsel for the Union of India unless the circumstances or events arise subsequent to the appointment as an Additional Judge, which bear adversely on the mental and physical capacity, character and integrity or other matters the appointment as a permanent Judge has to be considered in the background of what has been stated in S.P. Guptas case (supra).	None
Though there is no right of automatic extension or appointment as a permanent Judge, the same has to be decided on the touchstone of fitness and suitability (physical, intellectual and moral).	None
The weightage required to be given cannot be lost sight of.	None
It was observed But at the same time we find considerable substance in the plea of the petitioners that a person who is not found suitable for being appointed as a permanent Judge, should not be given extension as an Additional Judge unless the same is occasioned because of non availability of the vacancy.	None
If a person, as rightly contended by the petitioners, is unsuitable to be considered for appointment as a permanent Judge because of circumstances and events which bear adversely on the mental and physical capacity, character and integrity or other relevant matters rendering it unwise for appointing him as a permanent Judge, same yardstick has to be followed while considering whether any extension is to be given to him as an Additional Judge.	None
A person who is functioning as an Additional Judge cannot be considered in such circumstances for re appointment as an Additional Judge.	None
If the factors which render him unsuitable for appointment as a permanent Judge exist, it would not only be improper but also undesirable to continue him as an Additional Judge.	None
Mr. Venugopal, however, has drawn our attention to S.P. Gupta (supra) so far as it while dealing with the case of Shri O.N. Vohra was concerned to contend that as he had accepted the decision of the President of India not to extend his term and indeed as a person concerned should not litigate his claim to this high office which would lower its dignity by making it subject matter of litigative controversy, even refused to look into the correspondences exchanged between the Law Minister, the Chief Justice of Delhi and the Chief Justice of India as being not relevant to the issues arising for determination in the writ petition holding that the Union of India could not be required to disclose it.	Arguments of Petitioner
While saying so, the court while considering the case of S.N. Kumar who had claimed relief from the court in regard to his continuance as an Additional Judge not only looked into the files but made a deep probe in the matter.	None
The court further noticed the opinion of the Chief Justice of India in that behalf, holding At any rate, without going into further details as several constitutional functionaries were involved, two facts emerge(1) That C.J., Delhi who had undoubtedly a better chance of observing the performance and the functioning of Justice Kumar, was in a position to get first hand knowledge of his reputation, has honestly believed that Kumars reputation of integrity was doubtful.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has not revealed the sources from which he came to know about the reputation of Justice Kumar.	Arguments of Petitioner
The C.J.I., however, took a contrary view but he has also not disclosed the names of the lawyers or Judges who had given him a contrary version.	Arguments of Petitioner
In my opinion both of them did not disclose the names because the Judges or the lawyers concerned must have given the information in confidence and they would have been seriously embarrassed if their names were disclosed.(2)	Arguments of Petitioner
These views were put before the Central Government and it was open to the President to accept one view or the other.	Arguments of Petitioner
The President chose to accept the view taken by the C.J., Delhi more particularly because he was in a position to have firsthand information both regarding the reputation and working of the Additional Judge.	Arguments of Petitioner
528.	None
I might just state that even if the documents were not disclosed, the conclusion would have been the same because in the affidavits it was not disputed that the two C.Js. had taken a contrary view regarding the doubtful reputation of Justice Kumar, nor was it suggested that C.J., Delhi had any ill will or animus against Justice Kumar.	Arguments of Petitioner
The disclosure of the documents, however, unfortunately resulted in grave and serious consequences of farreaching effect on the future of not only the judicial institutions but also almost all the government departments.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is, thus, one thing to say that in the absence of any document, any reflection or aspersion on the reputation or character of an Additional Judge shall not be cast but it is another thing to say that the ultimate result, viz., that an Additional Judge did not obtain any extension or was not made a Permanent Judge of the High Court, would totally be ignored.	None
It may be true that the appellant did not question the decision of the collegium not to re appoint him, but, the fact remains that he was not appointed by the collegium wherefore sufficient material existed.	None
Arriving at such a conclusion was an objective opinion on the part of the collegium.	None
It was contended that if such a consideration is given an importance, those Chief Justices who had not been elevated to the Supreme Court despite seniority but were appointed as Chairman of various statutory authorities may be treated to be incompetent.	None
Appointment of a Judge of a Supreme Court in effect and substance is merit based.	None
Only because for one reason or the other he has been overlooked, the same, by itself, in our opinion, would not make him unfit for appointment on any other post.	None
The same has nothing to do with eligibility or suitability.	None
We agree with Mr. Venugopal that ordinarily it might not have been necessary for the Chief Justice of the High Court to call for such a file as the same would be a wellknown fact.	None
The Chief Justice of the High Court had joined sometime in May, 2008.	None
The letter of the State Government was received in July, 2008.	None
Prior thereto, as noticed hereinbefore, pursuant to a resolution adopted by a Full Court, the name of the appellant was put on the register of retired Judges.	None
The materials brought on records before this Court clearly demonstrate that no other fact was brought to his notice.	None
S.P. Gupta (supra), Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Association (supra) and other decisions to which we have adverted to hereinbefore in no uncertain terms lay down the law that the reason for nonappointment of an Additional Judge keeping in view the materials on the basis whereof the constitutional functionary, viz., the Chief Justice of the High Court, the State Government, the collegium of the Supreme Court as also the Central Government and ultimately the President of India had arrived at a decision would be a relevant factor.	Reasoning
We have noticed hereinbefore that the integrity of the holder of a high office plays an important role.	None
It was, thus, a factor which was required to be taken into consideration not only by the Chief Justice of the High Court but also by the State.	None
The consultative process brings within its ambit a heavy duty so as to enable the holder of a high office like Chief Justice to know the same.	None
It must be shown that he had access and in fact was aware of the fact that the appellant had not been made a Permanent Judge.	Reasoning
The matter might have been different if such a fact had been taken into consideration.	Reasoning
If a decision for the purpose of making a recommendation in terms of proviso appended to Section 16 of the Act necessitates looking into all relevant materials, non consideration of such a vital fact, in our opinion, cannot be ignored as the opinion is a subjective one and not based on objective criteria.	Reasoning
We are more than sure that had the records been brought to his notice, the Chief Justice would not have made the recommendation.	Reasoning
JUDICIAL REVIEW Judicial review in our constitutional scheme itself is a part of its basic structure.	None
Decisions whether arrived at by the Executive or the Judiciary are subject to judicial review.	None
The Chief Justice of a High Court, while making such recommendations, exercises statutory functions.	None
While it is incumbent upon the State Government to consult the Chief Justice, keeping in view a large number of decisions of this Court we have referred to hereinbefore, indisputably the Chief Justice of the High Court would have a heavy burden on his shoulder to recommend the name of a person who would be suitable therefore.	Reasoning
We are not oblivious of the fact that no court howsoever high would have any power of judicial review in relation thereto.	None
Power of judicial review, although is very restricted, cannot be denied to be exercised when relevant fact is not considered.	Reasoning
It is now a well settled principle of Administrative Law that the doctrine of error of law apparent on the face of the record inter alia would take within its umbrage a case where statutory authority in exercising its discretionary jurisdiction did not take into consideration a relevant fact or based its decision on wholly irrelevant factors not germane for passing the order.	Reasoning
What is not the subject matter of judicial review is the opinion of the Chief Justice touching upon the merit of the decision but the decision making process is subject to judicial review.	Reasoning
It stands conceded that the proviso appended to Section 16 of the Act is imperative in nature.	Reasoning
An appointment made without consulting the Chief Justice being wholly without jurisdiction would be void ab initio.	Reasoning
If the State is bound to consult the Chief Justice, we reiterate, such consultation must be an effective and informed one.	Reasoning
Both the State Government as also the Chief Justice before forming opinion must have access to all relevant informations.	Reasoning
Application of mind on the part of consultant and consulttee on such relevant information was, in our considered opinion, absolutely imperative.	None
Indisputably, a writ petition even at the instance of a busy body for issuance of a writ of quo warranto questioning the appointment of Chairman of a State Commission made in terms of Section 16 of the Act would be maintainable.	None
For the aforementioned purpose the eligibility criteria as laid down in Section 16 of the Act as also the question as to whether in making such an appointment the State consulted the Chief Justice of High Court as envisaged under the proviso appended thereto would fall for consideration.	None
An appointment to a statutory post is an administrative decision.	Reasoning
The act of consultation is an executive act.	None
In Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Association (supra), it was opined that the matter of appointment is an Executive Act.	None
It was furthermore held The object of selecting the best men to constitute the superior judiciary is achieved by requiring consultation with not only the judiciary but also the executive to ensure that every relevant particular about the candidate is known and duly weighed as a result of effective consultation between all the consultees before the appointment is made.	None
It is the role assigned to the judiciary and the executive in the process of appointment of Judges which is the true index for deciding the question of primacy between them, in case of any difference in their opinion.	None
The answer which best subserves this constitutional purpose would be the correct answer.	None
Section 16 of the Act envisages a limitation on the power of both the State as also the Chief Justice in the matter of making an appointment.	None
The facts relevant for such an appointment must be placed before both the statutory authorities.	None
One of such fact is that an Additional Judge, for one reason or the other was found not fit to be made permanent or to be given an extension of his tenure.	None
Indisputably, a person having doubtful integrity should neither be recommended by the High Court nor appointed by the State Government.	None
Opinion of a Chief Justice by itself may not lead to an administrative decision but it, having regard to his primacy, save and except for cogent reasons, would lead to an appointment.	None
Indisputably, his opinion is final and, thus, for all intent and purport, decisive.	None
The recommendations made, thus, may be arrived at on the basis of his subjective satisfaction, but it must be based on objective criteria.	None
Such subjective satisfaction must be arrived at on consideration of all relevant criteria.	None
When recommendation of a Former Judge of a High Court is made for appointment as Chairman of the State Commission ordinarily a judicial review shall not lie.	None
It is true that recommendation would be as a result of due application of mind.	None
He is required to recommend the name of one of the former Judges of the said Court.	None
All relevant facts leading to formation of an opinion as regards suitability of the person would presumably be known to him.	None
But a Chief Justice coming from outside may not know the former judges of the concerned High Court.	None
He may not consult his brother judges keeping in view the element of confidentiality attached to such recommendation.	None
It may be true that the statute does not lay down an objective criterion.	None
Such objective criteria cannot also be laid down keeping in view the status of the parties.	None
Such appointment, however, must be made keeping in view the independence of judiciary as the incumbent of the post would discharge judicial functions of grave importance.	None
Mr. Venugopal submits that the reason for nonreappointment of the Additional Judge concerned need not be ascertained by the Chief Justice.	Arguments of Petitioner
But the fact that he was not found fit therefore should have been made known to him.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court noticed that apart from placing the records to which reference has been made in its judgment, no other material was brought before the High Court to establish that the Chief Justice was aware of the said fact.	None
We are not in a position to persuade ourselves that the opinion of the Collegium that the appellant was not found fit to be continued as a judge was not relevant.	None
The opinion of the collegium is based on certain material.	Reasoning
It might have been arrived at without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Judge concerned.	Reasoning
What is relevant is the availability of materials on record to enable the Chief Justice of India visvis the collegium to make any recommendation that he was a fit person to be appointed.	Reasoning
If the collegium could not make such a recommendation, a fortiori ordinarily the Chief Justice of High Court would also not make such a recommendation.	None
In Special Reference No. 1 of 1998, RE (supra), it was concluded The questions posed by the Reference are now answered, but we should emphasise that the answers should be read in conjunction with the body of this opinionx x x2.	None
The transfer of puisne Judges is judicially reviewable only to this extent that the recommendation that has been made by the Chief Justice of India in this behalf has not been made in consultation with the four senior most puisne Judges of the Supreme Court and or that the views of the Chief Justice of the High Court from which the transfer is to be effected and of the Chief Justice of the High Court to which the transfer is to be effected have not been obtained.	None
The High Court in a case of this nature could have peeped into consultative process visvis eligibility of the candidate through a narrow hole.	None
Howsoever limited be the field of judicial review, it cannot, in our opinion, be held to be beyond its pale.	None
While we say so, we are not oblivious of the fact that the recommendations are required to be made from amongst the limited category of High Court Judges who were former Judges of that court.	None
However, the Chief Justice may even recommend the Judge of another High Court.	None
There is no constitutional bar that only a Judge of the High Court of that State in which the post has fallen vacant must be recommended.	None
We have noticed hereinbefore that the Madras High Court maintains a register of retired Judges.	None
Attention of the Chief Justice was drawn only to the said register.	None
Names of five Judges were proposed.	None
Mr. Venugopal has placed strong reliance on a judgment of the Privy Council in The Hubli Electricity Co. Ltd. v. The Province of Bombay AIR 1949 PC 136, wherein it was held Their Lordships now turn to the question of construction of Section 4(1)(a).	None
Their Lordships are unable to see that there is anything in the language of the Subsection or in the subjectmatter to which it relates upon which to found the suggestion that the opinion of the Government is to be subject to objective tests.	Arguments of Petitioner
In terms the relevant matter is the opinion of the Government  not the grounds on which the opinion is based.	Arguments of Petitioner
The language leaves no room for the relevance of a judicial examination as to the sufficiency of the grounds on which the Government acted in forming an opinion.	None
In that case the question which arose for consideration was as to whether in view of Section 4(1)(a) of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the licence for generation of electricity could be revoked where the licensee in the opinion of the Provincial Government makes willful and unreasonably prolonged default in doing anything required of him by or under the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 4(1)(a) of the Electricity Act underwent an amendment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even in Province of Bombay v. Kusaldas S. Advani and Ors. reported in 19501SCR621 this Court referred to The Hubli Electricity Co. Ltd. (supra) to opine that objective criteria were, in fact, laid down in the relevant provisions of the therein.	None
It was, however, observed It is abundantly clear from the authorities cited above that questions of fact such as the existence of a public purpose or the interest of the public safety or the defence of the realm or the efficient prosecution of the war, or the maintenance of essential supplies and the like may well be and, indeed, are often left to the subjective opinion or satisfaction of the executive authority.	None
Merely because such a matter involves a question of fact it does not follow at all that it must always, and irrespective of the language of the particular enactment, be determined judicially as an objective fact Everything, thus, depends upon the nature of the legal provision.	None
Administrative law moreover has much developed since then.	None
The approach of the Privy Council decision does not commend to us.	None
Where an opinion was not formed on relevant facts or within the restraints of the statute as an alternative safeguard to rules of natural justice where the function is administrative, evidently judicial review shall lie.	None
See Barium Chemicals Ltd. and Anr.	None
v. Company Law Board and Ors.	None
19671SCR898	None
In fact The Hubli Electricity Co. Ltd. (supra) has been considered by this Court in Narayanan Sankaran Mooss v. The State of Kerala and Anr.	None
19742SCR60 , stating The power to revoke the licence is a drastic power.	None
The revocation of licence results in severe abridgement of the right to carry on business.	None
Having in mind the requirements of Article 19(1)(g).	None
Parliament has, it seems to us, prescribed certain conditions to prevent the abuse of power and to ensure just exercise of power.	None
Clauses (a) to (d) of Section 4 prescribe some of the conditions precedent for the exercise of power.	None
The order of revocation, in breach of any one of those conditions, will undoubtedly be void.	None
The clause if in its opinion the public interest so requires is also a condition precedent.	None
On a successful showing that the order of revocation has been made without the Government applying its mind to the aspect of public interest or without forming an honest opinion on that aspect, it will, we have no doubt, be void.	None
The phrase after consulting the State Electricity Board is sandwiched between the clause if in its opinion the public interest so requires and clauses (a) to (d).	None
In this context it appears to us that consultation with the Board is also a condition precedent for making the order of revocation.	None
Accordingly the breach of this condition precedent should also entail the same consequence as the breach of the other conditions referred to earlier.	None
It may be observed that the phrase after consulting the State Electricity Board did not find place in Section 4 as it stood originally.	None
It was introduced in Section 4 in 1959 by an amendment.	None
It seems to us that it was introduced in Section 4 with the object of providing an additional safeguard to the licensee In Rohtas Industries v. S.D. Agarwal and Ors.	None
19693SCR108 , it was categorically held that the Judicial Committee was considering a preconstitutional provision which was not subject to the mandate of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.	None
While exercising the power of judicial review in a case of this nature, the court would not be concerned with the merit of the decision but with the decision making process.	None
If it is found that the decision making process has not been adhered to, indisputably, judicial review would lie.	None
Mr. Venugopal would submit that such an interpretation would open a floodgate.	None
We do not think so.	None
We even wish no occasion like the present one arises in future before the Superior Courts for their consideration.	None
Even otherwise, the floodgate argument does not appeal to us.	None
In Coal India Ltd. and Ors.	None
v. Saroj Kumar Mishra AIR2007SC1706 , this Court held The floodgate argument also does not appeal to us.	None
The same appears to be an argument of desperation.	None
Only because there is a possibility of floodgate litigation, a valuable right of a citizen cannot be permitted to be taken away.	None
This Court is bound to determine the respective rights of the parties.	None
See Zee Telefilms Ltd. v. Union of India and Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee v.	None
C.K. Rajan	None
It will also not be correct to contend that as nonappointment of the appellant did not cast a stigma, such a fact was not necessary to be noticed.	None
We have noticed S.P. Gupta (supra) that where facts are brought to the notice of the court, whether by way of affidavit by the constitutional authorities or by placing before the court the entire material, it is permissible to delve deep into the matter.	None
Once, thus, decision making process had been undergone in terms of the constitutional scheme in its correct perspective, judicial review may not be maintainable.	None
QUO WARRANTO Respondents herein filed the writ petitions inter alia for issuance of a writ of Quo Warranto.	None
A Writ of Quo Warranto can be issued when the holder of a public office has been appointed in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions.	None
Section 16 of the Act lays down the qualifications inter alia for appointment of the Chairman of the State Commission.	None
Clause (a) of Subsection (1) of Section 16 provides that the candidate must be is or has been a Judge.	None
The proviso appended thereto, however, mandates consultation by the State Government with the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court.	None
Concedingly, judicial review for the purpose of issuance of writ of Quo Warranto in a case of this nature would lie (A) in the event the holder of a public office was not eligible for appointment Processual machinery relating to consultation was not fully complied.	None
The writ of quo warranto proceedings affords a judicial remedy by which any person who holds an independent substantive public office is called upon to show by what right he holds the same so that his title to it may be duly determined and in the event it is found that the holder has no title he would be directed to be removed from the said office by a judicial order.	None
The proceedings not only give a weapon to control the executive from making appointments to public office against law but also tend to protect the public from being deprived of public office to which it has a right.	None
It is indisputably a high prerogative writ which was reserved for the use of Crown.	None
The width and ambit of the writ, however, in the course of practice, have widened and it is permissible to pray for issuance of a writ in the nature of quo warranto.	None
In Corpus Juris Secundum 74 C.J.S. Quo Warranto 14, Quo Warranto is defined as under Quo warranto, or a proceeding in the nature thereof, is a proper and appropriate remedy to test the right or title to an office, and to remove or oust an incumbent.	None
It is prosecuted by the state against a person who unlawfully usurps, intrudes, or holds a public office.	None
The relator must establish that the office is being unlawfully held and exercised by respondent, and that realtor is entitled to the office.	None
In the Law Lexicon by J.J.S. Wharton, Esq., 1987, Quo Warranto has been defined as under QUO WARRANTO, a writ issuable out of the Queens Bench, in the nature of a writ of right, for the Crown, against him who claims or usurps any office, franchise, or liberty, to enquire by what authority he supports his claim, in order to determine the right.

Indisputably a writ of Quo Warranto can be issued inter alia when the appointment is contrary to the statutory rules as has been held by this Court in High Court of Gujarat v. Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor Panchayat, (supra) and R.K. Jain v. Union of India and Ors.	None

We may furthermore notice that while examining if a person holds a public office under valid authority or not, the court is not concerned with technical grounds of delay or motive behind the challenge, since it is necessary to prevent continuance of usurpation of office or perpetuation of an illegality.	None
See Dr. Kashinath G. Jalmi and Anr.	None
v. The Speaker and Ors.	None
19932SCR820 .	None
Issuance of a writ of quo warranto is a discretionary remedy.	None
Authority of a person to hold a high public office can be questioned inter alia in the event an appointment is violative of any statutory provisions.	None
There concededly exists a distinction in regard to issuance of a writ of quo warranto and issuance of a writ of certiorari.	None
The scope and ambit of these two writs are different and distinct.	None
Whereas a writ of quo warranto can be issued on a limited ground, the considerations for issuance of a writ of certiorari are wholly different.	None
In Dr. Kashinath G. Jalmi (supra), it was held that even the motive or conduct of the appellants may be relevant only for denying them the costs even if their claim succeeds but it cannot be a justification to refuse to examine the merits of the question raised therein, since that is a matter of public concern and relates to good governance of the State.	None
In Shri Kumar Prasad v. Union of India and Ors.	None
(1993)IILLJ972SC , this Court held It is in the above context that we have to interpret the meaning of expression judicial office under Article 217(2)(a) of the Constitution of India.	None
The High Court Judges are appointed from two sources, members of the Bar and from amongst the persons who have held judicial office for not less than ten years.	None
Even a subordinate judicial officer manning a court inferior to the District Judge can be appointed as a Judge of a High Court.	None
The expression judicial office in generic sense may include wide variety of offices which are connected with the administration of justice in one way or the other.	None
Under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 powers of judicial Magistrate can be conferred on any person who holds or has held any office under the Government.	None
Officers holding various posts under the executive are often vested with the Magisterial powers to meet a particular situation.	None
Did the framers of the Constitution have this type of offices in mind when they provided a source of appointment to the high office of a Judge of High Court from amongst the holders of a judicial office.	None
The answer has to be in the negative.	None
We are of the view that holder of judicial office under Article 217(2)(a) means the person who exercises only judicial functions, determines causes interparties and renders decisions in a judicial capacity.	None
He must belong to the judicial service which as a class is free from executive control and is disciplined to uphold the dignity, integrity and independence of judiciary.	None
It was held that the Law Secretary although was holder of a judicial office but being not a judicial officer was not qualified to be appointed as a Judge of the High Court and, thus, his appointment was quashed.	None
In B.R. Kapur v. State of T.N. and Anr.	None
(supra), the question which arose for consideration was as to whether the Chief Minister of a State, who having been convicted in a criminal case, disqualified herself to become a member of a Legislative Assembly in terms of Article 191(1) of the Constitution of India could be appointed as the Chief Minister for a period of six months in terms of Article 164 thereof.	None
This Court having regard to Article 164(4) of the Constitution of India opined that if a person is disqualified to become a member of the legislative assembly, he cannot be inducted into the Council of Ministers for a short term which would extend beyond a period of six months.	None
It was held that a Writ of Quo Warranto can be issued even when the President or the Governor had appointed a person to a constitutional office.	None
It was furthermore held that the qualification of that person to hold that office can be examined in a quo warranto proceedings and the appointment can be quashed.	None
In R.K. Jain (supra), consultation by the executive which Chief Justice having found to be not necessary, it was held that no case for issuance of writ of quo warranto has been made out, stating Judicial review is concerned with whether the incumbent possessed of qualification for appointment and the manner in which the appointment came to be made or the procedure adopted whether fair, just and reasonable.	None
Exercise of judicial review is to protect the citizen from the abuse of the power etc.	None
by an appropriate Government or department etc.	None
In our considered view granting the compliance of the above power of appointment was conferred on the executive and confided to be exercised wisely.	None
When a candidate was found qualified and eligible and was accordingly appointed by the executive to hold an office as a Member or VicePresident or President of a Tribunal, we cannot sit over the choice of the selection, but it be left to the executive to select the personnel as per law or procedure in this behalf In that case, it was held that no case for issuance of a writ of certiorari had been made out as a third party had no locus standi to canvass the legality or correctness of the action seeking for issuance of a writ of certiorari.	None
Only public law declaration would be made at the behest of the appellant who was a public spirited person.	None
We may incidentally place on record that a declaratory relief had also been prayed for in the writ petitions filed by the respondents.	None
Reliance has also been placed on a decision of this Court in Union of India and Ors.	None
v. Kali Dass Batish and Anr.AIR2006SC789 wherein it was held Even assuming that the Secretary of the department concerned of the Government of India had not apprised himself of all necessary facts, one cannot assume or impute to a high constitutional authority, like the Chief Justice of India, such procedural or substantive error.	None
The argument made at the Bar that the Chief Justice of India might not have been supplied with the necessary inputs has no merit.	None
If Parliament has reposed faith in the Chief Justice of India as the paterfamilias of the judicial hierarchy in this country, it is not open for anyone to contend that the Chief Justice of India might have given his concurrence without application of mind or without calling for the necessary inputs.	None
The argument, to say the least, deserves summary dismissal.(Emphasis supplied) The decision in that case was rendered in the factual matrix obtaining therein.	None
Noticing that where members of the bar were required to be considered for important judicial posts, their antecedents are verified through the Intelligence Bureau and a report is obtained from it.	None
It was noticed that the Secretary (Personnel) had forwarded all necessary papers including the IB Report and sought for concurrence of the Chief Justice with regard to the names recommended by the Central Government.	None
In that case, as concurrence to the proposal of the Chief Justice of India was obtained after consideration of all the material, it was held It must be remembered that a member of an Administrative Tribunal like CAT exercises vast judicial powers, and such member must be ensured absolute judicial independence, free from influences of any kind likely to interfere with independent judicial functioning or militate there against.	None
It is for this reason, that a policy decision had been taken by the Government of India that while considering members of the Bar for appointment to such a post, their antecedents have to be verified by IB.	None
The antecedents would include various facts, like association with antisocial elements, unlawful organisations, political affiliations, integrity of conduct and moral uprightness.	None
All these factors have necessarily to be verified before a decision is taken by the appointing authority to appoint a candidate to a sensitive post like member of CAT.	None
In Delhi Admn.	None
v. Sushil Kumar this Court emphasised that even for the appointment of a constable in police services, verification of character and antecedents is one of the important criteria to test whether the selected candidate is suitable for a post under the State.	None
Even if such candidate was found physically fit, had passed the written test and interview and was provisionally selected, if on account of his antecedent record, the appointing authority found it not desirable to appoint a person of such record as a constable, the view taken by the appointing authority could not be said to be unwarranted, nor could it be interdicted in judicial review.	None
These are observations made in the case of a constable, they would apply with greater vigour in the case of appointment of a judicial member of CAT.	None
It is for this precise reason that Subsection (7) to Section 6 of the Act requires that the appointment of a member of CAT cannot be made except after consultation with the Chief Justice of India.	None
We may, however, notice that the Bench itself opined that for appointment as a member of an Administrative Tribunal like CAT, absolute judicial independence must be ensured.	Reasoning
It was furthermore opined This consultation should, of course, be an effective consultation after all necessary papers are laid before the Chief Justice of India, and is the virtual guarantee for appointment of absolutely suitable candidates to the post.	None
The observations of the Bench, as noticed hereinbefore, must be understood in the factual backdrop of the case.	None
The argument which was advanced therein, viz., the Chief Justice of India might not have been supplied with necessary inputs was found to be wholly meritless deserving summary rejection thereof.	Reasoning
In a case of this nature, there would not be any IB enquiry.	None
It was necessary for the Chief Justice to apprise himself fully with the background of the former judge concerned particularly where for one reason or the other he was not made permanent.	None
Our attention has furthermore been drawn to a decision of this Court in High Court of Gujarat and Anr.	None
v. Gujarat Kishan Mazdoor Panchayat and Ors.	None
(supra) wherein, one of us was a member.	None
Therein the question which arose for consideration was as to whether without appointing the members, the President of the Industrial Court, which was to consist of three or more members out of which one may be a President, could have been appointed straightway without appointing him as a member.	None
It has, however, been contended that disqualification cannot be read into or implied into the wording of a section.	None
Reliance in this behalf has been placed on Manohar Nathurao Samarth v. Marotrao and Ors.	None
19793SCR1078 wherein it has been held that Regulation 25 of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Staff) Regulations 1960 framed under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 and read with Section 15(g) of the City of Nagpur Corporation Act, 1948 provided for disciplinary action and not disqualificatory, observing 11No ground rooted in public policy compels us to magnify the disciplinary prescription into a disenfranchising taboo.	None
To revere the word to reverse the sense is to do injustice to the art of interpretation.	None
Reed Dickerson quotes a passage from an American case to highlight the guidelineThe meaning of some words in a statute may be enlarged or restricted in order to harmonize them with the legislative intent of the entire statute It is the spiritof the statute which should govern over the literal meaning.	None
13.	None
It is quite conceivable, if the legislature so expresses itself unequivocally, that even in a law dealing with disciplinary control, to enforce electoral disqualifications provided the legislature has competence.	None
The present provision does not go so far.14.	None
Even assuming that literality in construction has tenability in given circumstances, the doctrinal development in the nature of judicial interpretation takes us to other methods like the teleological, the textual, the contextual and the functional.	None
The strictly literal may not often be logical if the context indicates a contrary legislative intent.	None
Courts are not victims of verbalism but are agents of the functional success of legislation, given flexibility of meaning, if the law will thereby hit the target intended by the lawmaker.	None
Here the emphasis lies on the function, utility, aim and purpose which the provision has to fulfil.	None
A policy oriented understanding of a legal provision which does not do violence to the text or the context gains preference as against a narrow reading of the words used.	None
Indeed, this approach is a version of the plain meaning rule, and has judicial sanction.	None
In Hutton v. Phillips the Supreme Court of Delaware said(Interpretation) involves far more than picking out dictionary definitions of words or expressions used.	None
Consideration of the context and the setting is indispensable property to ascertain a meaning.	None
In saying that a verbal expression is plain or unambiguous, we mean little more than that we are convinced that virtually anyone competent to understand it, and desiring fairly and impartially to ascertain its signification, would attribute to the expression in its context a meaning such as the one we derive, rather than any other and would consider any different meaning, by comparison, strained, or farfetched, or unusual, or unlikely.	None
The said decision, thus, is an authority that in a given case, the disciplinary prescription may be magnified to a disenfranchising taboo, if any ground rooted in public policy is found therefore.	None
Emphasis has been laid on policy oriented understanding of a legal profession and not the strict literal meaning which may not often be logical if the context indicates a contrary legislative intent.	None
We have found hereinbefore that the appellant was not eligible for appointment of a public office and in any event the Processual machinery relating to consultation was not fully complied.	None
WRIT OF DECLARATION In this case, moreover, a writ of declaration was sought for.	None
This Court in Shri Kumar Padma Prasad (supra) issued a writ of declaration although a writ of quo warranto was sought for.	None
Declaring that the appellant therein was not qualified to be appointed as a Judge of the High Court, a consequential order directing him not to appoint was also issued.	None
PANEL The Chief Justice of the High Court forwarded a panel of three Judges including the appellant herein.	None
Whether Section 16 of the Act contemplates such a situation is the question.	None
Independence of the judiciary as embedded in Article 50 of the Constitution of India needs no overemphasis.	None
We have noticed hereinbefore that the State of Tamil Nadu in its letter dated 30th May, 2008 addressed to the Registrar of the Madras High Court while intimating that a vacancy had arisen in the post of President, State Commission, made a request to him to send a panel of eligible names of retired High Court Judges after approval by Honble the Chief Justice of the High Court of Madras for its consideration therefore.	None
Pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof, the Chief Justice only forwarded a panel of three Judges.	None
The Executive Government of the State made a final choice therefrom.	None
The process of selection in view of the decisions of this Court in Ashish Handa (supra) and Ashok Tanwar (supra) and National Consumer Awareness Group (supra) must be initiated by the High Court itself.	None
Having regard to the fact that the Chief Justice has the primacy as regards recommendations of the name for appointment to the post of Chairman of the State Commission, the method adopted herein, in our considered view, is impermissible in law.	Reasoning
For the said purpose only one name must emanate from the Chief Justice only one name can be recommended by him and not a panel of names.	Reasoning
Having regard to processual mandate required for the purpose of appointment to the post of Chairman, State Commission, the Executive Government of the State cannot have any say whatsoever in the matter.	Reasoning
The process for preparation of a panel requested by the Executive Government of the State and accepted by the Chief Justice of the High Court, in our opinion, was impermissible in law.	Reasoning
If the State is granted a choice to make an appointment out of a panel, as has been done in the instant case, the primacy of the Chief Justice, as opined by this Court in the aforementioned decisions, would stand eroded.	Reasoning
It will bear repetition to state that even for the said purpose the procedure laid down by this Court in Supreme Court AdvocatesonRecord Association (supra) as also the Special Reference, for recommendation of the name of the High Court Judge, as contained in Article 217 of the Constitution of India, should be followed.	Reasoning
It is accepted at the Bar that by reason of judicial constitutional interpretation of Articles 217 and 124 of the Constitution of India, the procedures laid down thereunder has undergone a drastic change.	Reasoning
A recommendation instead and in place of Chief Justice of India must emanate from the Collegium.	Reasoning
However, for the purpose of making recommendation in terms of Section 16(1) the opinion of the Chief Justice alone shall prevail.	None
It is difficult to accept the submission of Mr. K.K. Venugopal that such consultation would not be concurrence as like the Collegium in the matter of making recommendation for appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts where the view of he Collegium shall have the primacy.	Reasoning
For appointment as President of the State Commission, the Chief Justice of the High Court shall have the primacy and thus the term consultation even for the said purpose shall mean concurrence only.	Reasoning
It is true that if a panel of names is suggested and the State makes an appointment of one out of the three, the question of meeting of mind between the Chief Justice and the Executive would not arise but there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that by reason thereof the ultimate authority to appoint would be the Executive which in view of the decisions of this Court would be impermissible.	None
Mr. Venugopal would contend that for the aforementioned purpose the principle of purposive interpretation may be resorted to hold that the Chief Justice by sending a panel of Judges is merely recommending the names of the Judges, who is his opinion, are independent and fit persons to be appointed.	Reasoning
We are not in a position to accept the same.	None
For the aforementioned purpose the Court must bear in mind that the constitutional scheme of independence of the judiciary embodied in Article 50 of the Constitution of India should by no means be allowed to be eroded.	None
In A. Pandurangam Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Ors.	None
19761SCR602 this Court has held that the procedure adopted by the High Court by sending list of all the candidates for appointment to the post of District Judge so as enable the State to appoint the selectees out of the said panel is illegal stating The recommendation of the High Court for filling up the six vacancies was contained in its letter dated July 13, 1973.	None
Government was not bound to accept all the recommendations but could tell the High Court its reasons for not accepting the High Courts recommendations in regard to certain persons.	Reasoning
If the High Court agreed with the reasons in case of a particular person the recommendation in his case stood withdrawn and there was no question of appointing him.	Reasoning
Even if the High Court did not agree the final authority was the Government in the matter of appointment and for good reasons it could reject the High Courts recommendations.	Reasoning
In either event it could ask the High Court to make more recommendations in place of those who have been rejected.	Reasoning
But surely it was wrong and incompetent for the Government to write a letter like the one dated July 26, 1973 inviting the High Courts attention to Instruction 12(5) of the Secretariat instructions and on the basis of that to ask it to send the list of persons whom the High Court considered to have reasonable claims to the appointment.	Reasoning
On the basis of the furore created by the two Bar Associations of Hyderabad and the High Courts letter dated July 26, 1973 written in reply to the Governments letter dated July 24, 1973 no persons candidature recommended by the High Court had been rejected when the letter dated July 26, 1973 was written by the Government.	Reasoning
Even after rejection the Government could not ask the High Court to send the list of all persons whom the High Court considered to have reasonable claim to the appointment.	Reasoning
We feel distressed to find that instead of pointing out the correct position of law to the Government and itself acting according to it, a letter like the one dated August 1, 1973 was sent by the High Court in reply to the Governments letter dated July 26, 1973.	Reasoning
It is not clear from this letter whether it was written under the directions of Chief Justice and the other Judges of the High Court as in the case of the letter dated July 13, 1973.	Reasoning
But surely it was very much wrong on the part of the High Court to forward the entire list of the candidates interviewed with the marks obtained by them and adding at the same time that the High Court had no further remarks to offer.	Reasoning
We could not understand the reason for writing such a letter by the High Court.	Reasoning
But if we may hazard a surmise it seems to have been written in utter disgust at the Governments unreasonable attitude displayed in its letter dated July 26, 1973.	Reasoning
By no means could it be, nor was it, a recommendation by the High Court of all the 263 candidates interviewed, that all of them had a reasonable claim, or in other words, were fit to be appointed District Judges.	Reasoning
We must express our displeasure at and disapproval of all that happened between the Government and the High Court  in the former writing the letter dated July 26, 1973 and the latter sending the reply dated August 1, 1973.10.	Reasoning
Then comes the letter dated November 30, 1973.	Reasoning
After tracing the history of the recommendations made by the High Court in its letter dated July 13, 1973 and in the light of further information about these candidates as required from High Court, Government decided to select the six candidates mentioned therein including Respondents 3 to 6 as if they were from the list recommended by the High Court.	Reasoning
It was further stated in this letter Reasons for not selecting candidates placed by the High Court higher than those now selected are given in the annexure enclosed to this DO letter.	Reasoning
The High Court, to be more accurate, the Chief Justice to whom the letter dated November 30, 1973 was addressed seems to have not resented or protested against the selection so made by the Government in clear violation of Article 233 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
We find it intriguing that the letter written by the Registrar to the High Court on August 1, 1973 was treated as a recommendation of all the 263 candidates as having been found fit for appointment as District Judges.	Reasoning
By no means could it be so.	Reasoning
It was not so.	Reasoning
And yet the High Court or the Chief Justice did not object to the appointment of Respondents 3 to 6 as District Judges.	Reasoning
They were not eligible to be so appointed as their names had never been recommended.	None
In Ashok Tanwar (supra) it was held On 732000 the Registrar General of the High Court addressed a letter to the Financial CommissionercumSecretary (FS) of the State Government conveying recommendation of the Chief Justice for appointment of Mr Justice Surinder Swaroop, a sitting Judge of the High Court, as President of the State Commission holding additional charge of the post.	Reasoning
In the said letter it was also stated that steps could be taken for appointment of Mr Justice Surinder Swaroop (Respondent 3 herein) as President of the State Commission in accordance with the law and rules.	Reasoning
Thereafter, a notification dated 1332000 was issued by the Governor, Himachal Pradesh, appointing Justice Surinder Swaroop as President of the State Commission.x x x9.	Reasoning
The High Court, after consideration of the respective contentions advanced on behalf of the parties and in the light of the decisions of this Court, held that the case of Ashish Handa related to the initiation of process, which was required to be followed in making appointment of President of the State Commission, and that such process should not have been initiated by the Government but it ought to have been initiated by the Chief Justice.	Reasoning
On facts the High Court found that although initially the process was started by the Government proposing the name of Respondent 3, Respondent 2, however, was aware of the legal position and it immediately drew the attention of Respondent 1 that the procedure adopted by Respondent 1 was not in accordance with law.	Reasoning
therefore, a second letter was addressed by Respondent 1 to Respondent 2.	Reasoning
Respondent 2 on receipt of the second letter made the recommendation to appoint Respondent 3 as President of the State Commission.	Reasoning
On that issue the High Court held that the action taken either by Respondent 1 or by Respondent 2 could not be said to be contrary to law or the directions issued by this Court in the case of Ashish Handa.	Reasoning
Consequently the writ petition was dismissed.	Reasoning
Hence, this appeal.	None
In National Consumer Awareness Group (supra) this Court has held Justice Amarjeet Chaudhary, the then incumbent, was to demit his office on 492003 on completion of his term as President of the Haryana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter referred to as the State Commission).	Reasoning
On 2582003 the Chief Minister of Haryana addressed a letter to the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court drawing his attention to the vacancy that was likely to arise on 592003, and expressed his view that Justice R.S. Mongia, retired Chief Justice of the Gauhati High Court, would be a befitting incumbent to be appointed to the said post and requested for communication of the views of the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.	Reasoning
By a communication dated 2682003, the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court drew the attention of the Chief Minister to the decision of this Court in Ashish Handa v. Chief Justice of High Court of Punjab Haryana and took the stand (SCC p. 148, para 3)even for initiation of the proposalthe executive is expected to approach the Chief Justice when the appointment is to be made for taking the steps to initiate the proposal, and the procedure followed should be the same as for appointment of a High Court Judge.	Reasoning
That would give greater credibility to the appointment made.	Reasoning
He, however, postponed a decision, as the senior most Judge of the collegium was out of station.	Reasoning
By a confidential communication dated 27 82003, the Chief Justice informed the Chief Minister that the collegium of the High Court had met and considered the names of several persons, and unanimously decided to recommend Justice R.C. Kathuria (retired) of the Punjab and Haryana High Court as most suitable and fit for appointment as President of the State Commission.	Reasoning
A copy of the relevant resolution was forwarded for information.	Reasoning
The resolution took note of the credentials of the three retired Judges, whose suitability was considered, and decided to recommend Mr Justice R.C. Kathuria as most suitable and fit for appointment.	Reasoning
Justice R.S. Mongia was also one of the three retired Judges, whose suitability was considered by the said resolution.8.	Reasoning
By a letter dated 29102003 the Chief Minister, Haryana, raised certain objections to the proposal made by the Chief Justice.	Reasoning
The collegium of the High Court considered the letter dated 29 102003 of the Chief Minister, Haryana and reiterated its earlier recommendation.	Reasoning
By a letter of 1122003 the Chief Minister drew the attention of the Chief Justice to what he considered were the deficiencies in the candidature of the learned Judge, whose name was proposed by the High Court.	Reasoning
Once again, the High Court after calling for several records and considering various other aspects of the matter reiterated its stand that there was no reason to recall the earlier recommendations to appoint Justice R.C. Kathuria (retired) as the President of the State Commission.	Reasoning
By another letter dated 712004, the Chief Minister of Haryana drew the attention of the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to the newly introduced Section 16(1A), vide (Amendment) Act 62 of 2002, and stated that since the post of the President of the State Commission was vacant at the moment, an Honble sitting Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court was required to be nominated to act as Chairman of the Selection Committee to be constituted under Section 16(1A).	Reasoning
There was certain other correspondence about certain representations made, which is not material.x x x18.	Reasoning
We are unable to accept this contention of the learned Counsel for the Union of India.	Reasoning
It is inconceivable that Subsection (1A) is intended for appointment of the President of the State Commission itself.	Reasoning
In the first place, we cannot accede to the contention that the Chairman of the State Commission, who is or has been a Judge of the High Court, can be selected by a Selection Committee comprising two Secretaries of the State Government.	Reasoning
Nothing could be more erosive of judicial independence than such interpretation of Subsection (1A).	Reasoning
This conclusion of ours is driven home by the proviso to Subsection (1A).	Reasoning
This proviso is intended to take care of a contingency where there exists a President of the State Commission, who is unable to chair the Selection Committee meeting because of absence or other similar reasons.	Reasoning
It is only in such a situation, that the State Government may request the Chief Justice of the High Court to nominate a sitting Judge to act as Chairman of the Selection Committee.	Reasoning
If the argument of the learned Counsel of the Union of India and the construction canvassed by him is admitted, it would mean that even where the President of the State Commission is appointed for the first time, the procedure would be that he would be appointed by a Committee of which two Secretaries would be members.	Reasoning
That would be obviously destructive of judicial independence.	None
Even in Union of India v. Kali Dass Batish, (supra) whereupon strong reliance has been placed by Mr. Venugopal, this Court held Consequently, Parliament has taken great care to enact, vide Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, that no appointment of a person possessing the qualifications prescribed in the Act as a member shall be made, except after consultation with the Chief Justice of India.	None
The consultation with the Chief Justice of India is neither a routine matter, nor an idle formality.	Reasoning
It must be remembered that a member of an Administrative Tribunal like CAT exercises vast judicial powers, and such member must be ensured absolute judicial independence, free from influences of any kind likely to interfere with independent judicial functioning or militate there against.	None
We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the process adopted by the High Court and the Chief Justice in asking for a panel of name and sending the same was not legally permissible.	None
CONCLUSION193.	None
The summary of our aforementioned discussions is as under Judicial review although has a limited application but is not beyond the pale of the superior judiciary in a case of this nature.(ii)	Decision
The superior courts may not only issue a writ of quo warranto	Decision
but also a writ in the nature of quo warranto.	Decision
It is also entitled to issue a writ of declaration which would achieve the same purpose.(iii)	Decision
For the purpose of interpretation of Constitution in regard to the status of an Additional Judge, the word has been would ordinarily mean a retired Judge and for the purpose of examining the question of eligibility, not only his being an Additional judge but also a qualification as to whether he could continue in the said post or he be appointed as an acting or ad hoc judge, his suitability may also be taken into consideration.(iv)	Decision
Section 16 of the Act must also be given a contextual meaning.	Decision
In a case of this nature, the court having regard to the wider public policy as also the basic feature of the Constitution, viz., independence and impartiality of the judiciary, would adopt a rule of purposive interpretation instead of literal interpretation.(v)	Decision
Due consultative process as adumbrated by this Court in various decisions in this case having not been complied with, appointment of Shri Kannadasan was vitiated in law.(vi)	Decision
The Government of the State of Tamil Nadu neither could have asked the High Court to send a panel of names of eligible candidates nor the Chief Justice of the High Court could have sent a panel of names of three Judges for appointment to the post of Chairman, State Commission.	None
Before parting, however, we would place on record that Mr. Ramamurthy, learned Counsel on 5.5.2009 filed a memorandum before us stating that the appellant Shri N. Kannadasan has submitted his resignation.	None
It is, however, not stated that the said offer of resignation has been accepted by the State of Tamil Nadu.	Decision
Moreover, there is no prayer for withdrawal of the special leave petition.	None
We, in the aforementioned situation, are proceeding to pronounce our judgment.	None
We must also place on record our deep appreciation for the learned Counsel for the parties and in particular Shri G.E. Vahanvati, the learned Solicitor General of India for rendering valuable assistance to us.	None
For the reasons aforementioned, we do not find any merit in these appeals, which are dismissed accordingly.	None
No costs.	Decision
