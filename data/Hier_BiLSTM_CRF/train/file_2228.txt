14.7.88 is legal and justified?	Facts
If not to what relief the concerned workman is entitled?	None
Before the Tribunal a contention was raised by the Respondent No.1 herein that the Appellant is not a workman within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act.6.	Facts
By reason of its award dated 28.5.1996, the Tribunal held that in view of the fact that the Appellant was discharged after the completion of the apprenticeship period, he must be held to be a workman within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act.7.	Facts
The Respondent No.1 filed a writ petition before the Allahabad High Court questioning the said award.	Facts
Before the High Court, the Appellant herein relied upon a decision of this Court in S.K. Verma vs. Mahesh Chandra and Another (1983) 3 SCR 799 (1983) 4 SCC 214 ) in support of its contention that a Development Officer of the Corporation is a workman.8.	Facts
The High Court, however, relying on or on the basis of a Constitution Bench decision of this Court in H.R. Adyanthaya and others vs. Sandoz (India) Ltd. and others (1994) 5 SCC 737 ) held that as therein S.K. Verma (supra) was held to have been rendered per incuriam, it was no longer a good law.	Facts
The writ petition was allowed on that premise.	Facts
Ms. Indira Jaisingh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant would contend that in S.K. Verma (supra) this Court upon taking into consideration the works performed by a Development Officer came to the conclusion that as neither the same are managerial or supervisory in nature, he would be deemed to be a workman and, furthermore, in view of the fact that the said decision has not been overruled by this Court in H.R. Adyanthaya (supra), the High Court has committed a manifest error in passing the impugned judgment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. K. Ramamoorthy, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents, on the other hand, would submit that in H.R. Adyanthaya (supra) a Constitution Bench of this Court has clearly laid down the law that even if a person does not perform managerial or supervisory duties, with a view to hold that he is a workman, it must be established that he performs skilled or unskilled, manual, supervisory, technical or clerical work for hire or reward and as it has not been established that the Appellant herein performed any of the jobs enumerated in Section 2(s) of the Act, he is not a workman.	None
The learned counsel has also drawn our attention to a Scheme known as the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Apprentice Development Officers) Recruitment Scheme, 1980 (for short the Scheme) for the purpose of showing that an Apprentice Development Officer, is a person recruited for training and subsequent appointment to the cadre of Development Officers.	None
It was submitted that as the Appellant was appointed in terms thereof, unless he was appointed and confirmed as a Development Officer the question of his becoming a workman would not arise.	Arguments of Respondent
The Scheme framed by the Corporation although is not a statutory one but the same governs the terms and conditions of appointment of Apprentice Development Officer.	None
An Apprentice Development Officer is a person recruited for training and subsequent appointment to the cadre of Development Officer.	None
Clause 4 of the Scheme lays down the eligibility criteria for recruitment as also the recruitment procedure.	None
Clause 5 of the said Scheme provides for apprenticeship and training.	None
The period of apprenticeship is one year.	None
During the said period, the Apprentice is required to undergo theoretical training at training centre for two months, training in a selected rural branch for one month and a field training for a period of nine months.	None
An Apprentice Development Officer is paid a monthly stipend.	None
The period of apprenticeship is not counted as service for any purpose including seniority, increments, gratuity, etc.	None
Clause 6.1 of the Scheme provides that an Apprentice Development Officer may be discharged at any time without any notice or without assigning any reason whatsoever.	None
Only upon satisfactory completion of the apprenticeship period an Apprentice Development Officer is appointed as a Development Officer on probation, the period wherefore is also one year.	None
The terms and conditions of service of a Development Officer are governed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960.	None
The question as to whether a sale representative is a workman within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act came up for consideration before a 3Judge Bench of this Court in Management of M s. May and Baker (India) Ltd. vs. Their Workmen (AIR 1967 SC 678 ) wherein upon considering the definition of workman, as it then stood, it was held At that time the definition of the word workman under S.2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act did not include employees like Mukherjee who was a representative.	None
A workman was then defined as any person employed in any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual or clerical work for hire or reward.	None
Therefore, doing manual or clerical work was necessary before a person could be called a workman.	None
This definition came for consideration before industrial tribunals and it was consistently held that the designation of the employee was not of great moment and what was of importance was the nature of his duties.	None
If the nature of the duties is manual or clerical then the person must be held to be a workman.	None
On the other hand if manual or clerical work is only a small part of the duties of the person concerned and incidental to his main work which is not manual or clerical, then such a person would not be a workman.	None
It has, therefore, to be seen in each case from the nature of the duties whether a person employed is a workman or not, under the definition of that word as it existed before the amendment of 1956.	None
The nature of the duties of Mukherjee is not in dispute in this case and the only question, therefore, is whether looking to the nature of the duties it can be said that Mukherjee was a workman within the meaning of S.2(s) as it stood at the relevant time.	None
We find from the nature of the duties assigned to Mukherjee that his main work was that of canvassing and any clerical or manual work that he had to do was incidental to his main work of canvassing and could not take more than a small fraction of the time for which he had to work.	None
In the circumstances the tribunals conclusion that Mukherjee was a workman is incorrect.	None
The tribunal seems to have been led away by the fact that Mukherjee had no supervisory duties and had to work under the directions of his superior officers.	None
That, however, would not necessarily mean that Mukherjees duties were mainly manual or clerical.	None
From what the tribunal itself has found it is clear that Mukerjees duties were mainly neither clerical nor manual.	None
Therefore, as Mukerjee was not a workman his case would not be covered by the Industrial Disputes Act and the tribunal would have no jurisdiction to order his reinstatement A similar view was taken by this Court in Western India Match Co. Ltd. vs. Workmen (1964)	None
3	None
SCR 560 , Burmah Shell Oil Storage Distribution Co. of India Ltd. vs. Burmah Shell Management Staff Assn. (1970) 3 SCC 378 and in other cases.	None
A Division Bench of this Court, however, without noticing the aforementioned binding precedent, in S.K. Verma (supra) held that the duties and obligations of a Development Officer of Life Insurance Corporation of India being neither managerial nor supervisory in nature, he must be held to be a workman.	None
Correctness of S.K. Verma (supra) came up for consideration before a Constitution Bench of this Court in H.R. Adyanthaya (supra).	None
Referring to this Courts earlier decisions in May and Baker (supra), Western India Match Co. (supra) and Burmah Shell Oil Storage (supra), it was observed that as in S.K. Verma (supra) the binding precedents were not noticed and furthermore in view of the fact that no finding was given by the court as to whether the Development Officer was doing clerical or technical work and admittedly not doing any manual work, the same had been rendered per incuriam.	None
The Constitution Bench summarized the legal position that arose from the statutory provisions and from the decisions rendered by this Court, stating Till 29.8.1956 the definition of workman under the ID Act was confined to skilled and unskilled manual or clerical work and did not include the categories of persons who were employed to do supervisory and technical work.	None
The said categories came to be included in the definition w.e.f. 29.8.1956 by virtue of the Amending Act 36 of 1956.	None
It is, further, for the first time that by virtue of the Amending Act 46 of 1982, the categories of workmen employed to do operational work came to be included in the definition.	None
What is more, it is by virtue of this amendment that for the first time those doing nonmanual unskilled and skilled work also came to be included in the definition with the result that the persons doing skilled and unskilled work whether manual or otherwise, qualified to become workmen under the ID Act.	None
Considering the decisions in May and Baker (supra), Western India Match Co.	None
(supra), Burmah Shell Oil Storage (supra) as also S.K. Verma (supra) and other decisions following the same, this Court in H.R. Adyanthaya (supra) observed However, the decisions in the later cases, viz.	None

SCR 169 , and Ciba Geigy (1985) 3	None
SCR 371 1985 SCC (L S) 808 1985 Supp (1) SCR 282) cases did not notice the earlier decisions in May Baker (1961) 2 LLJ 94 AIR 1967 SC 678 (1961) 2 FLR 594 ) WIMCO (1964) 3	None
SCR 560 AIR 1964 SC 472 (1963) 2 LLJ 459 ), and Burmah Shell (1970) 3 SCC 378 (1971) 2	None
SCR 758 AIR 1971 SC 922 (1970) 2 LLJ 590) cases and the very same contention, viz.	None
if a person did not fall within any of the categories of manual, clerical, supervisory or technical, he would qualify to be workman merely because he is not covered by either of the four exceptions to the definition, was canvassed and though negatived in earlier decisions, was accepted.	None
Further, in those cases the Development Officer of the LIC, the Security Inspector at the gate of the factory and StenographercumAccountant respectively, were held to be workmen on the facts of those cases.	None
It is the decision of this Court in A. Sundarambal case (1988) SCC (L S) 892) which pointed out that the law laid down in May and Baker case (1961) 2 LLJ 94 (AIR 1967 SC 678 (1961) 2 FLR 594 ) was still good and was not in terms disowned.	None
The Constitution Bench although noticed the distinct cleavage of opinion in two lines of cases but held These decisions are also based on the facts found in those cases.	None
They have, therefore, to be confined to those facts.	None
Hence the position in law at it obtains today is that a person to be a workman under the ID Act must be employed to do the work of any of the categories viz., manual, unskilled, skilled, technical, operational, clerical or supervisory.	None
It is not enough that he is not covered by either of the four exceptions to the definition.	None
We reiterate the said interpretation.	None
The said reasons are, therefore, supplemental to the ones recorded earlier viz (i) They were rendered per incurium and (ii) May and Baker (supra) is still a good law.21.	Reasoning
Once the ratio of May and Baker (supra) and other decisions following the same had been reiterated despite observations made to the effect that S.K. Verma (supra) and other decisions following the same were rendered on the facts of that case, we are of the opinion that this Court had approved the reasonings of May and Baker (supra) and subsequent decisions in preference to S.K. Verma (supra).22.	Reasoning
The Constitution Bench further took notice of the subsequent amendment in the definition of workman and held that even the Legislature impliedly did not accept the said interpretation of this Court in S.K. Verma (supra) and other decisions23.	Reasoning
It may be true, as has been submitted by Ms. Jaisingh, that S.K. Verma (supra) has not been expressly overruled in H.R. Advanthaya (supra) but once the said decision has been held to have been rendered per incuriam, it cannot be said to have laid down a good law.	Reasoning
This Court is bound by the decision of the Constitution Bench.24.	Reasoning
From a perusal of the award dated 28.5.1996 of the Tribunal, it does not appear that the Appellant herein had adduced any evidence whatsoever as regard the nature of his duties so as to establish that he had performed any skilled, unskilled, manual, technical or operational duties.	Reasoning
The offer of appointment dated 16.7.1987 read with the Scheme clearly proved that he was appointed as an apprentice and not to do any skilled, unskilled, manual, technical or operational job.	Reasoning
The onus was on the Appellant to prove that he is a workman.	Reasoning
He failed to prove the same.	Reasoning
Furthermore, the duties and obligations of a Development Officer of the Corporation by no stretch of imagination can be held to be performed by an apprentice.25.	Reasoning
Even assuming that the duties and obligations of a Development Officer, as noticed in paragraph 8 of S.K. Verma (supra) are applicable in the instant case, it would be evident that the Appellant herein could not have organized or developed the business of the Corporation without becoming a fullfledged officer of the Corporation.	Reasoning
Only an officer of the Corporation duly appointed can perform the functions of recruiting agents and take steps for organizing and developing the business of the Corporation.	Reasoning
No area furtherance could be allotted to him for the purpose of recruiting active and reliable agents drawn from different communities and walks of life in view of the categorical findings of the Tribunal that he had been working as an apprentice.	Reasoning
If organizing and developing the business of the Corporation and to act as a friend, philosopher and guide of the agents working within his jurisdiction were the primary duties and obligations of a Development Officer, an apprentice evidently cannot perform the same.26.	Reasoning
We may consider the matter from another angle, viz., the appointment of the Appellant as an apprentice under the Scheme visavis the Apprentices Act, 1961.27.	Reasoning
The expression Apprentice has been included in the definition of workman contained in Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947	Reasoning
but by reason of a subsequent Parliamentary legislation, namely, Apprentices Act, 1961 (the 1961 Act), the term apprentice has been defined in Section 2(aa) to mean a person who is undergoing apprenticeship training in a designated trade in pursuance of a contract of apprenticeship.	Reasoning
Section 18 of the 1961 Act provides that apprentices are trainees and not workers save as otherwise provided in the Act.	Reasoning
Clause (a) and (b) of Section 18 of the 1961 Act read thus (a) every apprentice undergoing apprenticeship training in a designated trade in an establishment shall be a trainee and not a worker and(b) the provisions of any law with respect to labour shall not apply to or in relation to such apprentice.	Reasoning
The term employee under various labour laws has been defined by different expressions but Section 18 of the 1961 Act carves out an exception to the applicability of labour laws in the event the concerned person is an apprentice as contradistinguished from the expressions worker, employee and workman, used in different statutes.29.	Reasoning
Apprentice under the general law means a person who is bound by a legal agreement to serve an employer for an agreed period and the employer is bound to instruct him.	Reasoning
In Halsburys Laws of England, 4th Edn.	None
Volume 16, it is stated Form and parties.	None
A contract of apprenticeship is unenforceable if it is not in writing.	None
Usually the contract is effected by deed under which the apprentice is bound to serve a master faithfully in a trade of business for an agreed period and the master undertakes to give the apprentice instruction in it and either to maintain him or pay his wages.	None
Technical words are not necessary.	None
An apprentice cannot be bound without his own consent, and consent without execution of the instrument is insufficient.	None
The instrument must be executed by the apprentice himself, for no one else has a right to bind him.	None
In the case of a minor his father or mother or other guardian, although not necessary parties to the contract, usually execute it too in order to covenant for the apprentices due performance of the contract since, in the absence of a local custom, an apprentice who is a minor cannot be sued on his own covenant.	None
A contract of apprenticeship is binding on a minor only if it is on the whole beneficial to him.	None
It is not essential that the master should execute a deed of apprenticeship, but where a master had in fact executed one part of an instrument of apprenticeship, a recital in that part of the instrument that the apprentice had bound himself apprentice to the master is evidence against the master that the apprentice had executed the other part of the instrument.	None
A corporation may take an apprentice.	None
Apprentice, as noticed hereinbefore, is defined to mean a who is undergoing apprenticeship training pursuant to a contract apprenticeship.	Reasoning
How a contract of apprenticeship would be entered into is to be found in subsection (1) of Section 4 of the 1961 Act.	Reasoning
The embargos placed in this regard are (i) entering into a contract of apprenticeship with a minor in which event the contract must be executed by his guardian and (ii) on such terms or conditions which shall not be inconsistent with any provision of the Act or any rule framed thereunder.31.	Reasoning
Furthermore, the apprentice must satisfy the statutory requirements as regard qualification to be appointed as an apprentice.32.	Reasoning
Training of apprenticeship by reason of subsection (2) of Section 4 shall be deemed to have commenced on the date on which the contract of apprenticeship has been entered into under subsection (1) thereof.33.	Reasoning
The provisions of the Scheme framed by the Corporation conform to the provisions of the Apprentices Act and Rules framed thereunder.	Reasoning
It is worth noticing that Provident funds and insurance have been specified to be a designated trade within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Apprentices Act, 1961 by a notification	Reasoning
No. G.S.R. 463(E) dated 23rd August, 1975.34.	Reasoning
The definition of workman as contained in Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 includes an apprentice, but a workman defined under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 must conform to the requirements laid down therein meaning thereby, inter alia, that he must be working in one or the other capacities mentioned therein and not otherwise.35.	Reasoning
We may further notice before the Tribunal a contention was raised by the Appellant that upon expiry of the period of one year he was appointed as a probationary officer but the said plea was categorically rejected by the Tribunal holding The concerned workman has also pleaded that after expiry of one year he was appointed as Probationary Development Officer.	Reasoning
No date of issuance of such order has been filed.	None
In its absence the version of the concerned workman is disbelieved and it is held that concerned workman after expiry of apprenticeship was not appointed as Probationary Development Officer.	None
Instead he continued to work as Apprentice.	None
A workman within the meaning of Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 must not only establish that he is not covered by the provisions of the Apprenticeship Act but must further establish that he is employed in the establishment for the purpose of doing any work contemplated in the definition.	Reasoning
Even in a case where a period of apprenticeship is extended, a further written contract carrying out such intention need not be executed.	Reasoning
But in a case where a person is allowed to continue without extending the period of apprenticeship either expressly or by necessary implication and regular work is taken from him, he may become a workman.	Reasoning
A person who claims himself to be an apprentice has certain rights and obligations under the statute.37.	Reasoning
In case any person raises a contention that his status has been changed from apprentice to a workman, he must plead and prove the requisite facts.	Reasoning
In absence of any pleading or proof that either by novation of the contract or by reason of the conduct of the parties, such a change has been brought about, an apprentice cannot be held to be workman.38.	Reasoning
It is true that the definition of workman as contained in Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act is exhaustive.39.	Reasoning
The interpretation clause contained in a statute although may deserve a broader meaning having employed the word includes but therefor also it is necessary to keep in view the scheme of the object and purport of the statute, which takes him out of the said definition.	Reasoning
Furthermore, the interpretation section begins with the words unless the context otherwise requires.	Reasoning
In Ramesh Mehta vs. Sanwal Chand, Singhvi and others reported in 2004 (5) SCC 409 , it was noticed A definition is not to be read in isolation.	None
It must be read in the context of the phrase which would define it.	None
It should not be vague or ambiguous.	None
The definition of words must be given a meaningful application where the context makes the definition given in the interpretation clause inapplicable, the same meaning cannot be assigned.	None
In State of Maharashtra vs. Indian Medical Assn. one of us (V.N. Khare, CJ.) stated that the definition given in the interpretation clause having regard to the contents would not be applicable.	None
It was stated (SCC p.598, para 8)8.	None
A bare perusal of Section 2 of the Act shows that it starts with the words in this Act, unless the context otherwise require.	None
Let us find out whether in the context of the provisions of Section 64 of the Act the defined meaning of the expression management can be assigned to the word management in Section 64 of the Act.	None
In para 3 of the Regulation, the Essentially Certificate is required to be given by the State Government and permission to establish a new medical college is to be given by the State Government under Section 64 of the Act.	None
If we give the defined meaning to the expression management occurring in Section 64 of the Act, it would mean the State Government is required to apply to itself for grant of permission to set up a government medical college through the University.	None
Similarly it would also mean the State Government applying to itself for grant of Essentially Certificate under para 3 of the Regulation.	None
We are afraid the defined meaning of the expression management cannot be assigned to the expression management occurring in Section 64 of the Act.	None
In the present case, the context does not permit or requires to apply the defined meaning to the word management occurring in Section 64 of the Act.	None
In Sri Chittaranjan Das vs. Durgapore Project Limited and others (1995 (2) CLJ 388 ), it was opined In my opinion, it is not difficult to resolve the apparent conflict.	None
Both in the Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Act, 1946 as also the certified Standing Order of the company the word including an apprentice occurs after the word person.	None
In that view of the matter in place of the word person, the word apprentice can be substituted in a given situation but for the purpose of becoming a workman either within the meaning of the 1946 Act or the standing order framed thereunder, he is required to fulfil the other conditions laid down therein meaning thereby he is required to be employed in an industry to do the works enumerated in the said definition for hire or reward, whether the terms of employment be express or implied.	None
The question as to who would answer the description of the term workman fell for consideration before this Court in Dharangadhra Chemical Works Ltd. vs. State of Saurashtra and others (AIR 1957 SC 264 ), wherein this Court held The essential condition of a person being a workman within the terms of this definition is that he should be employed to do the work in that industry, that there should be, in other words, an employment of his by the employer and that there should be the relationship between the employer and him as between the employer and employee or master and servant.	None
Unless a person is thus employed there can be no question of his being a workman within the definition of the term as contained in the Act.	None
Yet again in Workmen of Dimakuchi Tea Estate vs. Management of Dimakuchi Tea Estate (AIR 1958 SC 353 ), this Court held A little careful consideration will show, however, that the expression any person occurring in the third part of the definition clause cannot mean anybody and everybody in this wide would.	None
First of all, the subject matter of dispute must relate to (i) employment or nonemployment or (ii) terms of employment or conditions of labour of any person these necessarily import a limitation in the sense that a person in respect of whom the employer employee relation never existed or can never possibly exist cannot be the subject matter of a dispute between employers and workman.	None
Secondly, the definition clause must be read in the context of the subject matter and scheme of the Act, and consistently with the objects and other provisions of the Act.	None
It is well settled that the words of a statute, when there is a doubt about their meaning are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject of the enactment and the object which the legislature has in view.	None
Their meaning is found not so much in a strictly grammatical or etymological propriety of language, nor even in its popular use, as in the subject or in the occasion on which they are used, and the object to be attained.	None
(Maxwell, Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition, p.55).	None
For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that no case has been made out for interference with the impugned judgment.	Decision
45	None
There is no merit in these appeals, which are dismissed accordingly.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
