1.	None
Whether the prosecution proves that accused on 6.3.2012 at about 16.00 Hrs.	None
in the vicinity of Indira Nagar, old Jalna, T aluka and District Jalna, kidnapped xxx	Facts
d o Iliyas Pathan a minor girl under 16 years of age from her lawful guardianship without his consent, and thereby committed an offence punishable u s 363 of I.P .C.?	Facts
Whether the prosecution further proves that accused on above date, time and place of offence, committed rape on xxx and thereby committed an offence punishable u s 376 of IPC?	None
Whether the prosecution further proves that accused on above date, time and place of offence, committed carnal intercourse against the order of nature with minor girl xxx and thereby committed an offence punishable u s 377 of IPC?	None
Whether the prosecution further proves that accused on above date, time and place of offence, committed murder intentionally or knowingly causing death of xxx, and thereby committed an offence punishable u s 302 of IPC??	None
The Trial Court discussed the evidence at length in the context of each point and answered them in the affirmative.	None
It held the appellant guilty of the offences referred to above.	Facts
The Trial Court thereafter compared the aggravating circumstances?	Facts
visavis the mitigating circumstances?	Facts
and having found that the crime was committed in a most brutal, diabolical and revolting manner which shook the collective conscience of the society, it found that the R.R. T est (rarest of the rare cases) is fully attracted, hence capital punishment was imposed on the appellant under Section 302, IPC.	None
The High Court considered the death reference as well as the appeal preferred by the appellant against the trial Court judgment and after scrutinising the prosecution evidence, reached the following factual issues ?A. Accused was found with victim girl in a house one door of which was locked from outside and another door closed from inside, Multiple injuries found on the person of victim, Medical evidence showing that the girl was forcibly raped and done to death, Recovery of blood stained jeans pant and full bush shirt (torn) from the accused, Motive, F .	None
Failure of accused to offer plausible explanation to the incriminating circumstances against him.?	Facts
The High Court held that the circumstances conclusively prove that all the pieces of the puzzle fit so perfectly that they leave no reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the hypothesis of the innocence of the appellant, rather the same leads to the irrefutable conclusion that it is the appellant who took away the victim child to his house, sexually assaulted her, committed unnatural intercourse and throttled her to death.	Facts
Consequently, the conviction of the appellant under Sections 302, 376, 377 and 363 of the IPC.	Facts
was upheld.	Facts
The High Court thereafter engaged itself on the question of quantum of sentence and as to whether the R.R. T est was attracted to the facts and circumstances of this case.	Facts
The High Court drew up the balance sheet of the aggravating?	Facts
and mitigating?	Arguments of Respondent
circumstances and after their comparative analysis, it concurred with the extreme penalty awarded by the trial Court and confirmed the death sentence.	Facts
We have heard Ms. Nitya Ramkrishnan, Learned Counsel for the appellant and Mr. Nishant R. Katneshwarkar, Learned Counsel for the State of Maharashtra on merits as well as on the contentious issue re quantum of sentence and have minutely perused the relevant record.	None
Learned Counsel for the appellant argued that there are chinks in the culpability calculus that have a direct bearing on the quantum of sentence as well.	Arguments of Petitioner
She urged that according to Azbar (P .W.2), the appellant was distributing chocolates to children near Maroti T emple around 3.30 to 4.00 p.m. and that the mother of the victim called her husband Iliyas (P .W.9)	Arguments of Petitioner
around 5.00 p.m. to inform that the deceasedvictim had been missing since 4.00 p.m.	Arguments of Petitioner
There is no evidence that she was one amongst the children to whom the appellant was distributing chocolates where had the victim been until 4.00 p.m. and where and when was she last seen and in whose company?	Arguments of Petitioner
The argument is that the victim was not lastly seen in the company of the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was then urged that the appellant?s house is four houses away from that of the victim there are other houses next and opposite to that of the appellant, therefore, it is unbelievable that nobody saw the victim child being taken away by the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
She pointed out that five policemen entered the house of the appellant and the informant (P .W.9) also statedly accompanied them but the police officials in their depositions have not made any such reference.	Arguments of Petitioner
13.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to Learned Counsel for the appellant, Azbar (P .W.2) also went to the house of the appellant only after learning that the victim had been traced in the house of the appellant, yet he claims to have seen the appellant under the cot while the victim was on the cot inside the house.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was unbelievable that even after the police had entered the 10x10 room and had hunted him out, the appellant would still remain under the cot until P .W.2 reached the spot.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similarly, Aslam (P .W.5) who is the maternal uncle of the victim, also went to the appellant?s house only after the victim had been found there.	Arguments of Petitioner
Yet, he too found the appellant under the cot.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Learned Counsel, all these witnesses, namely, P .W.2, P .W.3, P .W.4, P .W.5	Arguments of Petitioner
and	Arguments of Petitioner
P .W.9 have been set out after learning that the child had been found purportedly to describe a scene immediately upon entering the house, which naturally cannot be the case.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was strongly urged that most of these persons did not witness the crime or scene of the crime as they have deposed that the child and the appellant were found in a state of undress, only Dilip Pralhadrao T ejan (P .W.3), who is a police official, says that the appellant was found outraging the modesty of the child.	Arguments of Petitioner
It thus suggests that the testimony of all these witnesses is not accurate and at best it leads to an inference that the child was found in the same house as was the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that the testimony of P .W.3, P .W.4 and P .W.9	Arguments of Petitioner
varies at the point as to what they saw on entering the house.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, P .W.3?s statement claiming that the appellant was found outraging the modesty of the child under the bed, is different from the version of others who found a cloth around the bed and could see the appellant and the victim only when the cloth was removed.	Arguments of Petitioner
P .W.9	Arguments of Petitioner
(father of the victim child) does not state the same facts as have been described by P .W.3	Arguments of Petitioner
or P .W.4	Arguments of Petitioner
and thus there is inconsistent version on what was seen inside the appellant?s house upon entering.	Arguments of Petitioner
14.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was then urged that the houses in the area were in a close cluster and it would have been difficult for the appellant to take the child away without being noticed by anyone.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, prosecution has failed to establish two crucial facts, namely, the place where the victim child was last seen and the estimated time of her death.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the absence of surety of these two facts as to when was the victim child last seen alive and her approximate time of death, the recovery of her dead body between 9.3010.00 p.m. in the house of the appellant per se is insufficient to establish the charge beyond reasonable doubt.	Arguments of Petitioner
15.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that even as per P .W.9	Arguments of Petitioner
(the informant) the appellant along with his family had been residing in that very house since the past 710 years, but the prosecution has failed to explain as to where had the other members of the family been during those six hours, between 4.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. on that fateful day.	Arguments of Petitioner
This assumes significance in view of the DNA report which merely indicates that they are from the same paternal progeny.	Arguments of Petitioner
16.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel lastly urged that since the basis for the match in DNA report is the comparison with the blood sample of the appellant, it was imperative upon the prosecution to establish that the sample indeed was that of the appellant only.	Arguments of Petitioner
The person, who drew the blood sample has not been examined as a witness nor the contemporary record of the procedure for taking blood sample has been explained.	Arguments of Petitioner
There is only a bald statement of the Investigating Officer that the appellant was referred to Ghati hospital, Aurangabad.	Arguments of Petitioner
There is no memo or material to show as to who collected the blood sample of the appellant, when was the sample collected and where and how was it preserved.	Arguments of Petitioner
As against it, the medical examination reports and sample collection reports of the appellant (Exbts.	Arguments of Petitioner
21, 21A and 22) indicate that no blood sample was taken which shows the incorrectness of the Investigating Officer?s testimony.	Arguments of Petitioner
The chemical lab at Mumbai also does not mention any receipt of a blood sample of the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
She argued that the prosecution has strongly relied on the D.N.A. evidence despite the fact that the method of analysis used, i.e., YChromosome Short T andem Repeat Polymorphism (YSTR) has certain inherent limitations due to which accurate identification of the accused cannot be established beyond a reasonable doubt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Unlike other processes like autosomal STR analysis, YSTR analysis does not allow for individual identification in the same male lineage.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was thus contended that the prosecution has failed to bring the guilty at home, hence the appellant deserves the benefit of doubt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned State Counsel, however, refuted all the appellant?s contentions and took us through the ocular and medical evidence, especially the eyewitness?s account to urge that there is no error or lapse worth whispering committed by the prosecution in establishing the appellant?s guilt.	Arguments of Respondent
He extensively referred to the relevant parts of the impugned judgments to explain as to how the aggravating?	Arguments of Respondent
and mitigating?	Arguments of Respondent
circumstances have been drawn up and weighed before awarding or confirming the death sentence.	Arguments of Respondent
Before entering the hassled arena of sentencing, it is apropos to recapitulate the facts and evidence on record to find out whether the prosecution has been able to prove the charges against the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt.	Issue
The victim was not even 2year old when she died an unnatural death.	Reasoning
The post mortem was conducted on 07.03.2012 by a panel of doctors, which included Dr. B.L. Survesh (P .W.7)	Reasoning

P .W.12 has been subjected to a fairly long crossexamination but no discrepancy, having bearing on the merits of the case, has been extracted.	None
After a tenacious analysis of the testimonies of the witnesses with respect to the facts seen by each one of them, there remains no room to doubt that on 06.03.2012 the appellant after taking liquor was seen distributing chocolates to children sometime around 3.30/4.00 p.m.	None
The victim child went missing around 4.00 p.m. as was informed to Ilias (P .W.9)	Reasoning
by his wife at about 5.00 p.m. The information of her missing was immediately circulated amongst the family members relatives and all of them desparately started searching for her.	Reasoning
Meanwhile, the missing report was lodged with police as well.	Reasoning
During such search operations by the police and also the family members of the missing child, it surfaced that the appellant was distributing chocolates to allure children near Maroti T emple on that day and around that time the child went missing.	Reasoning
The policeteam, Iliyas the father of the victim and his brother, genuinely apprehensive and smelling something foul, reached the house of the appellant and nabbed him redhanded under the bed with the victim in naked condition.	Reasoning
It further stands established conclusively that deceased had been brutally assaulted and subjected to vaginal and unnatural intercourse.	Reasoning
The victim had been inflicted multiple injuries on face, head, neck, external genetalia as well as inside the uterus and urethra.	Reasoning
We may in this regard refer to, in particular, the deposition of Dilip Pralhadrai T ejan (P .W.3), who after making forceful entry inside the appellant?s house, found him outraging the modesty of the child.	Reasoning
The appellant had the special knowlege as to in what circumstances the victim child suffered those multiple injuries.	Reasoning
The burden to prove that those injuries were not caused by him was on the appellant alone in view of Section 106 of the Evidence Act, which he has miserably failed to discharge though the evidence on record proves beyond doubt that the victim child was in unlawful custody of the appellant from about 4.00 p.m. till she breathed her last breath due to the beastly attack on her.

He has further deposed that all samples were seized and handed over to the police.	None

Shrikant Lade (P .W.11) accordingly prepared the DNA report which is duly attested by the Assistant Chemical Analyser also.	None
On seeing the contents of his report, P .W.11 has pertinently deposed that ?	None
I can opine on going through the reports Exbts.	None
7576 that there were sexual intercourse and unnatural intercourse on the victim by the accused Ravi.?	None
emphasis applied.	None
The unshakable scientific evidence which nails the appellant from all sides, is sought to be impeached on the premise that the method of DNA analysis ?	None
YSTR?	Reasoning
followed in the instant case is unreliable.	Reasoning
It is suggested that the said method does not accurately identify the accused as the perpetrator and unlike other methods say autosomalSTR analysis, it cannot distinguish between male members in the same lineage.	Reasoning
We are, however, not swayed by the submission.	Reasoning
The globally acknowledged medical literature coupled with the statement of P .W.11 Assistant Director, Forensic Science Laboratory leaves nothing mootable that in cases of sexual assualt, DNA of the victim and the perpetrator are often mixed.	Reasoning
Traditional DNA analysis techniques like ?	Reasoning
autosomal STR? are not possible in such cases.	Reasoning
YSTR method provides a unique way of isolating only the male DNA by comparing the Y Chromosome which is found only in males.	Reasoning
It is no longer a matter of scientific debate that YSTR screening is manifestly useful for corroboration in sexual assault cases and it can be well used as excalpatory evidence and is extensively relied upon in various jurisdictions throughout the world.	Reasoning
Science and Researches have emphatically established that chances of degradation of the Loci?	Reasoning
in samples are lesser by this method and it can be more effective than other traditional methods of DNA analysis.	Reasoning
Although YSTR does not distinguish between the males of same lineage, it can, nevertheless, may be used as a strong circumstantial evidence to support the prosecution case.	Reasoning
YSTR techniques of DNA analysis are both regularly used in various jurisdictions for identification of offender in cases of sexual assault and also as a method to identify suspects in unsolved cases.	Reasoning
Considering the perfect match of the samples and there being nothing to discredit the DNA analysis process, the probative value of the forensic report as well as the statement of P	Reasoning
.W.11 are very high.	Reasoning
Still further, it is not the case of the appellant that crime was committed by some other close relative of him.	Reasoning
Importantly, no other person was found present in the house except the appellant.	Reasoning
There is thus overwhelming eyewitness account, circumstantial evidence, medical evidence and DNA analysis on record which conclusively proves that it is the appellant and he alone, who is guilty of committing the horrendous crime in this case.	Reasoning
We, therefore, unhesitatingly uphold the conviction of the appellant.	Reasoning
Motive Though the High Court has observed that satisfaction of lust?	Reasoning
and removal of trace?	Reasoning
was the appellant?s motive but motive is not an explicit requirement under the Indian Penal Code, though motive?	Reasoning
may be helpful in proving the case of the prosecution in a case of circumstantial evidence.	Reasoning
This Court has held in a catena of decisions that lack of motive would not be fatal to the case of prosecution as sometimes human beings act irrationally and at the spur of the moment.	Reasoning
The case in hand is not entirely based on circumstantial evidence as there are reliable eyewitness depositions who have seen the appellant committing the crime, may be in part.	Reasoning
Such an unshakable evidence with dense support of DNA test does not require the definite determination of the motive of the appellant behind the gruesome crime.	Reasoning
Sentencing On the question of sentence, Learned Counsel for the appellant vehemently urged that the Courts below have been largely influenced by the nature?	Arguments of Petitioner
and brutality?	Arguments of Petitioner
of the crime while awarding the extreme sentence of death penalty.	Arguments of Petitioner
She referred to a list of as many as 35 decisions rendered by this Court in the cases of rape and murder of a childvictim in which the death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that brutality of the crime alone is not sufficient to impose the sentence of death it is imperative on the State to establish that the convict is beyond reform and to this end it is relevant to see whether this is the first conviction or there has been previous crimes.	Arguments of Petitioner
The socio economic conditions of the convict and the state of mind must be assessed by the Court before awarding such a penalty the death penalty must not be awarded in a case of circumstantial evidence as any chink in the culpability calculus would interdict the extreme penalty.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel heavily relied upon (i) Kalu Khan v. State of Rajasthan (2015) 16 SCC 492 in which a threeJudge Bench of this Court commuted the death sentence in murder, abduction and rape, holding that the life imprisonment would serve the object of reformation, retribution and prevention and that giving and taking life is divine, which cannot be done by Courts unless alternatives are foreclosed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Another threeJudge Bench decision in Sunil v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2017) 4 SCC 393 where a 25 year old was held guilty of murder and rape of a 4year old child, but not sent to gallows on the parameters that he could be reformed and rehabilitated, has been pressed into aid.	Arguments of Petitioner
She, in specific, cited several threeJudge Bench judgments where the young age of the accused was taken as a mitigating circumstance and in the absence of previous criminal history, the conduct of the accused while in custody and keeping in view the socioeconomic strata to which he belonged, the possibility of reform was not ruled out and death penalty was commuted.	Arguments of Petitioner
39.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel for the appellant placed great reliance on a threeJudge Bench decision of this Court dated December 12, 2018 rendered in Rajindra Pralhadrao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra in Review Petition(Crl.)	Arguments of Petitioner
Nos. 306307/2013 in which the appellant was held guilty of rape and murder of a 3 year old child and the death sentence was substituted by the life imprisonment with a rider, ?that the convict shall not be released for the rest of his life?.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Court viewed in that case that (a) the case was solely based on circumstantial evidence, (b) probability of reformation and rehabilitation could not be ruled out, (c) DNA sample of the accused was taken, but not submitted in the Trial Court, and (d) the factum of pendency of two similar cases against the accused reflecting on his bad character was not admissible.	None
Yet another threeJudge Bench decision of this Court in Parsuram v. State of Madhya Pradesh (Criminal Appeal Nos. 314315 of 2013), decided on 19 th February, 2019 where also death sentence awarded to a 22year old who was found guilty of rape and murder of a minor girl, was commuted on the principles quoted above, has been relied upon.	Arguments of Petitioner
40.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant?s Counsel urged that the High Court ought not to have followed (i) Dhanjoy Chaterjee v. State of West Bengal (1994) 2 SCC 220 , which was later on doubted by this Court in Shankar Kishanrao Khade v. State of Maharashtra (2013) 5 SCC 546 and (ii) Shivaji v. State of Maharashtra (2008) 3 SCC 269 which too was held to be per curian in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra (2009) 6 SCC 498.	Arguments of Petitioner
She very passionately urged that neither the High Court nor the Trial Court have given reasons for imposition of death penalty as both the Courts have been influenced by the nature of the crime.	Arguments of Petitioner
The mitigating circumstances of the appellant were inadequately represented.	Arguments of Petitioner
The brutality of the crime is the predominant ground for imposition of death penalty though this Court has cautioned contrarily in a catena of decisions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Both the Courts have failed in recording a finding that the appellant was beyond reform and unless it was so found, the case cannot belong to the rarest of the rare?	Arguments of Petitioner
category.	Arguments of Petitioner
41.	Arguments of Petitioner
Relying upon the facts like (i) lack of criminal antecedents (ii) no record of antisocial conduct prior to the crime (iii) appellant being 2530 years of age (iv) brutality of crime cannot be a ground to award death sentence and (v) the appellant belongs to poor section of society, his learned Counsel urged that this is not a fit case for imposition of death penalty.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned State Counsel, contrarily, maintained that the instant case satisfies the principle of rarest of the rare cases?	Arguments of Respondent
and the appellant who committed the crime of rape and murder of a barely 2year old innocent toddler in the most dastardly manner, does not deserve any liniency.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, the appellant is a menace to the society and to deter such like crimes against mankind, this Court should show no misplaced sympathy.	Arguments of Respondent
The question which eventually falls for consideration is whether the instant case satisfies the test of rarest of the rare cases?	Issue
and falls in such exceptional category where all other alternatives except death sentence, are foreclosed and whether this Court should explore the award of actual life imprisonment as prescribed by this Court in Swamy Shraddananda Murli Manohar Mishra v. State of Karnataka (2008) 13 SCC 767 which has got seal of approval of the Constitution Bench in Union of India v. V. Sriharan Murugan Ors.	Issue
(2016) 7 SCC 1.	Issue
The Constitution Bench of this Court in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1980) 2 SCC 684 , while upholding the constitutionality of death penalty under Section 302 IPC and the sentencing procedure embodied in Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, struck a balance between the protagonists of the deterrent punishment on one hand and the humanity crying against death penalty on the other and elucidated the strict parameters to be adhered to by the Courts for awarding death sentence.	None
While emphasising that for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule?	None
and death setnence an exception?, this Court viewed that a rule abiding concern for the dignity of the human life postulates resistance in taking the life through laws instrumentality and that the death sentence be not awarded ?save in the rarest of the rare cases?	None
when the alternative option is foreclosed.	None
In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab (1983) 3 SCC 470 , this Court formulated the following two questions to be considered as a test to determine the rarest of the rare cases in which the death sentence can be inflicted ?	None
(a) Is there something uncommon, which renders sentence for imprisonment for life inadequate calls for death sentence?	None
Rather the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative, but to impose the death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speaks in favour of the offender??	None
Machhi Singh then proceeded to lay down the circumstances in which death sentence may be imposed for the crime of murder and held as follows The reasons why the community as a whole does not endorse the humanistic approach reflected in ?death sentenceinnocase?	None
doctrine are not far to seek.	None
In the first place, the very humanistic edifice is constructed on the foundation of ?reverence for life?	None
principle.	None
When a member of the community violates this very principle by killing another member, the society may not feel itself bound by the shackles of this doctrine.	None
Secondly, it has to be realized that every member of the community is able to live with safety without his or her own life being endangered because of the protective arm of the community and on account of the rule of law enforced by it.	None
The very existence of the rule of law and the fear of being brought to book operates as a deterrent for those who have no scruples in killing others if it suits their ends.	None
Every member of the community owes a debt to the community for this protection.	None
When ingratitude is shown instead of gratitude by ?killing?	None
a member of the community which protects the murderer himself from being killed, or when the community feels that for the sake of self preservation the killer has to be killed, the community may well withdraw the protection by sanctioning the death penalty.	None
But the community will not do so in every case.	None
It may do so ?	None
in rarest of rare cases?	None
when its collective conscience is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty.	None
The community may entertain such a sentiment when the crime is viewed from the platform of the motive for, or the manner of commission of the crime, or the antisocial or abhorrent nature of the crime, such as for instance I. Manner of commission of murder 33.	None
When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community.	None
For instance, (i) when the house of the victim is set aflame with the end in view to roast him alive in the house.	None
(ii) when the victim is subjected to inhuman acts of torture or cruelty in order to bring about his or her death.	None
(iii) when the body of the victim is cut into pieces or his body is dismembered in a fiendish manner.	None
II.	None
Motive for commission of murder 34.	None
When the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness.	None
For instance when (a) a hired assassin commits murder for the sake of money or reward (b) a coldblooded murder is committed with a deliberate design in order to inherit property or to gain control over property of a ward or a person under the control of the murderer or visavis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of trust, or (c) a murder is committed in the course for betrayal of the motherland.	None
III.	None
Antisocial or socially abhorrent nature of the crime 35.	None
(a) When murder of a member of a Scheduled Caste or minority community etc., is committed not for personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse social wrath.	None
For instance when such a crime is committed in order to terrorize such persons and frighten them into fleeing from a place or in order to deprive them of, or make them surrender, lands or benefits conferred on them with a view to reverse past injustices and in order to restore the social balance.	None
(b) In cases of ?bride burning?	None
and what are known as ?dowry deaths?	None
or when murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry another woman on account of infatuation.	None
IV.	None
Magnitude of crime 36.	None
When the crime is enormous in proportion.	None
For instance when multiple murders say of all or almost all the members of a family or a large number of persons of a particular caste, community, or locality, are committed.	None
V. Personality of victim of murder 37.	None
When the victim of murder is (a) an innocent child who could not have or has not provided even an excuse, much less a provocation, for murder (b) a helpless woman or a person rendered helpless by old age or infirmity (c) when the victim is a person visavis whom the murderer is in a position of domination or trust (d) when the victim is a public figure generally loved and respected by the community for the services rendered by him and the murder is committed for political or similar reasons other than personal reasons?	None
It thus spells out from Machhi Singh (supra) that extreme penalty of death sentence need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability and where the victim of a murder is (a) an innocent child who could not have or has not provided even an excuse, much less a provocation for murder?, such abhorent nature of the crime will certainly fall in the exceptional category of gravest cases of extreme culpability.	Reasoning
This Court in Machhi Singh?s case confirmed the death sentence awarded to Kashmir Singh  one of the appellants as he was found guilty of causing death to a poor defenceless child (Balbir Singh) aged 6 years.	Reasoning
The appellant Kashmir Singh was categorised as a person of depraved mind with grave propensity to commit murder.	Reasoning
Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh, the Constitution Bench and the ThreeJudge Bench decisions respectively, continue to serve as the foundationstone of contemporary sentencing jurisprudence though they have been expounded or distinguished for the purpose of commuting death sentence, mostly in the cases of (i) conviction based on circumstantial evidence alone (ii) failure of the prosecution to discharge its onus re reformation (iii) a case of residual doubts and (iv) where the other peculiar mitigating?	Reasoning
circumstances outweighed the aggravating?	Reasoning
circumstances.	Reasoning
It is noteworthy that the object and purpose of determining quantum of sentence has to be society centric?	Reasoning
without being influenced by a judge?s? own views, for society is the biggest stake holder in the administration of criminal justice system.	Reasoning
A civic society has a fundamental?	Reasoning
and human?	Reasoning
right to live free from any kind of psycho fear, threat, danger or insecurity at the hands of antisocial elements.	Reasoning
The society legitimately expects the Courts to apply doctrine of proportionality and impose suitable and deterent punishment that commensurate(s) with the gravity of offence.	Reasoning
Equally important is the standpoint of a victim? which includes his her guardian or legal heirs as defined in Section 2(wa), Cr.	Reasoning
P .C.	Reasoning
For long, the criminal law had been viewed on a dimensional plane wherein the Courts were required to adjudicate between the accused and the State.	Reasoning
The victim?	Reasoning
the de facto sufferer of a crime had no say in the adjudicatory process and was made to sit outside the court as a mute spectator.	Reasoning
The ethos of criminal justice dispensation to prevent and punish crime?	Reasoning
would surreptitiously turn its back on the victim? of such crime whose cries went unheard for centuries in the long corridors of the conventional apparatus.	Reasoning
A few limited rights, including to participate in the trial have now been bestowed on a victim?	Reasoning
in India by the Act No. 5 of 2009 whereby some pragmatic changes in Cr.P .C. have been made.	Reasoning
The Sentencing Policy, therefore, needs to strike a balance between the two sides and count upon the twin test of (i) deterrent effect, or (ii) complete reformation for integration of the offender in civil society.	Reasoning
Where the Court is satisfied that there is no possibility of reforming the offender, the punishments before all things, must be befitting the nature of crime and deterrent with an explicit aim to make an example out of the evildoer and a warning to those who are still innocent.	Reasoning
There is no gainsaying that the punishment is a reflection of societal morals.	Reasoning
The subsistence of capital punishment proves that there are certain acts which the society so essentially abhores that they justify the taking of most crucial of the rights the right to life.	Reasoning
If the caselaw cited on behalf of the appellant where this Court commuted death sentence into life imprisonment for the rest of the life?	None
or so is appreciated within these contours, it won?t need an elaborate discussion that the peculiarity of the facts and circumstances of each case prompted this Court to invoke leniency and substitute the death sentence with a lesser punishment.	None
The threeJudge Bench decision in Rajendra Pralhadrai Washnik (supra) is clearly distinguisahable on this very premise as that was a case, not only based on circumstantial evidence but where even the DNA sample of the accused though taken was not submitted in the trial Court.	None
It was thus a case of ?residuary doubts?	None
as explained by this Court in Ashok Debbarma v. State of Tripura (2014) 4 SCC 747.	None
The same analogy takes away the persuvasive force in Parsuram (supra), for that too was a case where the guilt was established only on the basis of circumstantial evidence.	None
Contrary to it, a ThreeJudge Bench of this Court in Vsanta Sampat Dupare v. State of Maharashtra (2017) 6 SCC 631 , which is very close on facts to this case, found the convict guilty of raping and battering to death a little girl of 4 years after luring her by giving chocolates.	None
The prosecution established its case by relying upon the last seen theory?	None
as the appellant was seen taking away the victim on a bicycle on the fateful day.	None
The eyewitness account, the disclosure statement made by the accused coupled with the other circumstantial evidence nailed him.	None
The death setence was confirmed by this Court on 26 th November, 2014.	None
He, thereafter filed a Review Petition after about three years, claiming that postconfirmation of his death sentence, he had improved his academic qualification, completed the Gandhi Vichar Pariksha and had also participated in the Drawing Competition organised sometime in January, 2016.	None
It was also asserted that his jail record was without any blemish and there was a possibility of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated.	None
This Court dismissed the Review Petition by way of a selfspeaking judgment, holding that the aggravating circumstances, namely, the extreme depravity and the barbaric manner in which the crime was committed and the fact that the victim was a helpless child of four years clearly outweigh the mitigating circumstances now brought on record.	None
In Khushwinder Singh v. State of Punjab, (2019) 4 SCC 415 , this Court affirmed the death sentence of an accused who had killed six innocent persons, out of which two were minors, by kidnapping three persons, drugging them with sleeping tablets, and then pushing them into a canal.	None
Thereafter, three other members of the same family were also done away with.	None
This Court upheld the award of capital punishment observing as follows Now, so far as the capital punishment imposed by the learned Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court is concerned, at the outset, it is required to be noted that, as such, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused is not in a position to point out any mitigating circumstance which warrants commutation of death sentence to the life imprisonment.	None
In the present case, the accused has killed six innocent persons, out of which two were minors below 10 years of age.	None
Almost, all the family members of PW 5 were done to death in a diabolical and dastardly manner.	None
Fortunately, or unfortunately, only one person of the family of PW 5 could survive.	None
In the present case, the accused has killed six innocent persons in a preplanned manner.	None
The convict meticulously planned the time.	None
He first kidnapped three persons by way of deception and took them to the canal and after drugging them with sleeping tablets, pushed them in the canal at midnight to ensure that the crime is not detected.	None
That, thereafter he killed another three persons in the second stage instalment.	None
Therefore, considering the law laid down by this Court in Mukesh v. State (NCT of Delhi), (2017) 6 SCC 1 (2017) 2 SCC (Cri) 673 , the case would fall in the category of the ?rarest of rare case?	None
warranting death sentence capital punishment.	None
The aggravating circumstances are in favour of the prosecution and against the accused.	None
Therefore, striking a balance between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, we are of the opinion that the aggravating circumstance would tilt the balance in favour of capital punishment.	None
In the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that there is no alternative punishment suitable, except the death sentence.	None
The crime is committed with extremist brutality and the collective conscience of the society would be shocked.	None
Therefore, we are of the opinion that the capital punishment death sentence imposed by the learned Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court does not warrant any interference by this Court.	None
Therefore, we confirm the death sentence of the accused imposed by the learned Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court while convicting the appellant for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.?	None
In a recent ThreeJudge Bench decision of this Court in Manoharan v. State by Inspector of Police, Variety Hall Police Station, Coimbatore, (2019)	None
SCC Online 951, the appellant?s capital punishment was confirmed by the High Court in a case in which he along with his coaccused was held guilty of kidnapping a 10year old girl and her 7year old brother.	None
After committing gang rape of the minor girl, both the victims were done away with by throwing them into a canal which caused their death by drowning.	None
This Court (by majority) upheld the death sentence, concluding as follows ?	None
41.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the circumstances, we have no doubt that the trial court and High Court have correctly applied and balanced aggravating circumstances with mitigating circumstances to find that the crime committed was cold blooded and involves the rape of a minor girl and murder of two children in the most heinous fashion possible.	None
No remorse has been shown by the Appellant at all and given the nature of the crime as stated in paragraph 84 of the High Court?s judgment it is unlikely that the Appellant, if set free, would not be capable of committing such a crime yet again.	None
The fact that the Appellant made a confessional statement would not, on the facts of this case, mean that he showed remorse for committing such a heinous crime.	None
He did not stand by this confessional statement, but falsely retracted only those parts of the statement which implicated him of both the rape of the young girl and the murder of both her and her little brother.	None
Consequently, we confirm the death sentence and dismiss the appeals.?	None
It is equally apt at this stage to refer the recent amendments carried out by Parliament in the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 by way of The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act, 2019 as notified on 6 th August, 2019.	Reasoning
The unamended Act defines ?	Reasoning
Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault?	Reasoning
in Section 5, which included, ?whoever commits aggravated penetrative sexual assault on a child below the age of 12 years.?	None
Originally, the punishment for an aggravated sexual assault was rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 10years but which may extend for imprisonment for life with fine.	Reasoning
The recent amendment in Section 6 of 2012 Act has substituted the punishment as follows Post the Amendment, Section 6 has been substituted as follows 6.	None
(1) Whoever commits aggravated penetrative sexual assault shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than twenty years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of natural life of that person, and shall also be liable to fine, or with death .	None
(2) The fine imposed under subsection (1) shall be just and reasonable and paid to the victim to meet the medical expenses and rehabilitation of such victim.	None
Emphasis applied The minimum sentence for an aggravated penetrative sexual assault has been thus increased from 10 years to 20 years and imprisonment for life has now been expressly stated to be imprisonment for natural life of the person.	Reasoning
Significantly, death sentence? has also been introduced as a penalty for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexualt assault on a child below 12 years.	Reasoning
The Legislature has impliedly distanced itself from the propounders of ?	Reasoning
NoDeath Setence?	Reasoning
in ?	Reasoning
No Circumstances? theory and has restated the will of the people that in the cases of brutal rape of minor children below the age of 12 years without murder of the victim, death penalty?	Reasoning
can also be imposed.	Reasoning
In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of amendment, Parliament has shown its concern of the fact that ?in recent past incidents of child sexual abuse cases administering the inhuman mindset of the accused, who have been barbaric in their approach to young victim, is rising in the country.?If the Parliament, armed with adequate facts and figures, has decided to introduce capital punishment for the offence of sexual abuse of a child, the Court hitherto will bear in mind the latest Legislative Policy even though it has no applicability in a case where the offence was committed prior thereto.	Reasoning
The judicial precedents rendered before the recent amendment came into force, therefore, ought to be viewed with a purposive approach so that the legislative and judicial approaches are well harmonised.	Reasoning
In the light of above discussion, we are of the considered opinion that sentencing in this case has to be judged keeping in view the parameters originating from Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh cases and which have since been strengthened, explained, distinguished or followed in a catena of subsequent decisions, some of which have been cited above.	Reasoning
Having said that, it may be seen that the victim was barely a twoyear old baby whom the appellant kidnapped and apparently kept on assaulting over 45 hours till she breathed her last.	Reasoning
The appellant who had no control over his carnal desires surpassed all natural, social and legal limits just to satiate his sexual hunger.	Reasoning
He ruthlessly finished a life which was yet to bloom.	Reasoning
The appellant instead of showing fatherly love, affection and protection to the child against the evils of the society, rather made her the victim of lust.	Reasoning
It?s a case where trust has been betrayed and social values are impaired.	Reasoning
The unnatural sex with a twoyear old toddler exhibits a dirty and perverted mind, showcasing a horrifying tale of brutality.	Reasoning
The appellant meticulously executed his nefarious design by locking one door of his house from the outside and bolting the other one from the inside so as to deceive people into believing that nobody was inside.	Reasoning
The appellant was thus in his full senses while he indulged in this senseless act.	Reasoning
Appellant has not shown any remorse or repentance for the gory crime, rather he opted to remain silent in his 313 Cr.P .C. statement.	Reasoning
His deliberate, welldesigned silence with a standard defence of false?	Reasoning
accusation reveals his lack of kindness or compassion and leads to believe that he can never be reformed.	Reasoning
That being so, this Court cannot write off the capital punishment so long as it is inscribed in the statute book.	Reasoning
All that is needed to be followed by us is what O?	Reasoning
Conner J. very aptly observed in California v. Ramos, 463 U.S. 992 that the ?qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination?	Reasoning
and in order to ensure that the death penalty is not meted out arbitrarily or capriciously, the Court?s principal concern has to be with the procedure by which the death sentence is imposed than with the substantive factors laid before it.	None
For the reasons aforestated, we dismiss the appeals and affirm the death sentence.	Decision
Subhash Reddy, J. I have gone through the opinion of my learned Brother, Surya Kant, J. I am in agreement with the view expressed in the said judgment, to the extent of confirming the conviction recorded against the appellant, for the offence under Sections 363, 376, 377 and 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short IPC?).	None
However, as I am of the view that, this is not a fit case where the appellant is to be awarded capital punishment, i.e, death penalty, as such, I wish to share my view separately, in this judgment.	None
The appellant was tried for committing the rape and murder on the minor girl child ?	Facts
Zoyabano?	Facts
and he was charged for offence punishable under Sections 363, 376, 377 and	Facts
302 IPC.	Facts
After the trial, learned Additional Sessions Judge at Jalna, by judgment dated 16.09.2015, has held that appellant is guilty for the charges framed against him.	Facts
By order dated 18.09.2015, the trial court, by recording a finding that crime committed by the appellant is heinous, brutal and inhuman, convicted and sentenced the appellant to death for the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and ordered that he shall be hanged by neck till he is dead, subject to confirmation by the High Court as per Section 366 of Code of Criminal Procedure and also imposed a fine of Rs.500/ (Rupees Five Hundred Only).	Facts
Similarly, learned Additional Sessions Judge has convicted the appellant for offence punishable under Section 376 of IPC and ordered sentence to suffer life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500/(Rupees Five Hundred Only) and a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for 10 years for the offence punishable under Section 377 IPC with a fine of Rs.500/(Rupees Five Hundred Only) and a sentence of R.I. for one year for the offence punishable under Section 363 with a fine of Rs.500/ (Rupees Five Hundred Only).	Facts
Further, it was ordered that all the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently.	Facts
The reference which was made to the High Court under Section 366 was numbered as Confirmation Case No.1 of 2015 and the appeal preferred by the appellant was numbered as criminal appeal No. 783 of 2015.	Facts
The High Court by the Common Judgment and Order dated 20.01.2016, while dismissing the criminal appeal preferred by the appellant, has confirmed the death sentence imposed under Section 302 IPC.	Facts
Hence, these appeals.	Facts
I am in agreement with the view expressed by my learned Brother, to the extent of upholding conviction, as such, there is no need to appreciate the evidence onrecord in detail.	None
As such, I confine consideration of such evidence onrecord to the extent to modify the sentence on the appellant.	None
For the conviction recorded against the appellant for the offences alleged against him, by balancing the aggravated and mitigated circumstances, I am of the view that the death sentence imposed on the appellant requires modification to that of the life imprisonment, without any remission, for the following reasons.	None
For the offence under Section 302 of IPC the punishment prescribed for committing murder is death or imprisonment for life.	None
At first instance, challenge to Section 302 of IPC was turned down by this Court in the case of Jagmohan Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh 1973(1) SCC 20 .	None
Further, in Constitution Bench, this Court in the case of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab 1980(2) SCC 684 , ,concluded that Section 302, providing death penalty for offence of murder is constitutional.	None
In the aforesaid judgment, this Court has indicated the standards and norms, restricting the area for imposition of death penalty.	None
Further, for considering the imposition of sentence of death, aggravating and mitigating circumstances were also broadly indicated.	None
In the aforesaid judgment, while considering the scope of Section 235(2) read with Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, this Court has held that, in fixing the degree of punishment or in making the choice of sentence for various offences, including one under Section 302, IPC, the Court should not confine its consideration ?	None
principally or merely?	None
to the circumstances connected with the particular crime, but also due consideration to the circumstances of the criminal.	None
However, it is observed that, what is the relative weight to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors, depends on facts and circumstances of each case.	None
The aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as suggested by Dr.Chitale were mentioned in the Judgment.	None
Paragraphs 202 to 207 of the judgment reads as under Drawing upon the penal statutes of the States in U.S.A. framed after Furman v. Georgia 33 L Ed 2d 346 408 US 238 (1972) , in general, and clauses 2 (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the Indian Penal Code (Amendment)	None
Bill passed in 1978 by the Rajya Sabha, in particular, Dr Chitale has suggested these ?aggravating circumstances??Aggravating circumstances A court may, however, in the following cases impose the penalty of death in its discretion (a) if the murder has been committed after previous planning and involves extreme brutality or (b) if the murder involves exceptional depravity or (c) if the murder is of a member of any of the armed forces of the Union or of a member of any police force or of any public servant and was committed while such member or public servant was on duty or in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such member or public servant in the lawful discharge of his duty as such member or public servant whether at the time of murder he was such member or public servant, as the case may be, or had ceased to be such member or public servant or (d) if the murder is of a person who had acted in the lawful discharge of his duty under Section 43 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, or who had rendered assistance to a Magistrate or a police officer demanding his aid or requiring his assistance under Section 37 and Section 129 of the said Code.?	None
Stated broadly, there can be no objection to the acceptance of these indicators but as we have indicated already, we would prefer not to fetter judicial discretion by attempting to make an exhaustive enumeration one way or the other.	None
204.	None
In Rajendra Prasad (1979) 3 SCC 646 1979 SCC (Cri) 749 , the majority said ?	None
It is constitutionally permissible to swing a criminal out of corporeal existence only if the security of State and Society, public order and the interests of the general public compel that course as provided in Article 19(2) to (6)? .	None
Our objection is only to the word ?only?.	None
While it may be conceded that a murder which directly threatens, or has an extreme potentiality to harm or endanger the security of State and Society, public order and the interests of the general public, may provide ?special reasons?	None
to justify the imposition of the extreme penalty on the person convicted of such a heinous murder, it is not possible to agree that imposition of death penalty on murderers who do not fall within this narrow category is constitutionally impermissible.	None
We have discussed and held above that the impugned provisions in Section 302 of the Penal Code, being reasonable and in the general public interest, do not offend Article 19, or its ?ethos?	None
nor do they in any manner violate Articles 21 and 14.	None
All the reasons given by us for upholding the validity of Section 302 of the Penal Code, fully apply to the case of Section 354(3), Code of Criminal Procedure, also.	None
The same criticism applies to the view taken in Bishnu Deo Shaw v. State of W.B. (1979) 3 SCC 714 1979 SCC (Cri) 817 which follows the dictum in Rajendra Prasad (1979) 3 SCC 646 1979 SCC (Cri) 749 .	None
205.	None
In several countries which have retained death penalty, preplanned murder for monetary gain, or by an assassin hired for monetary reward is, also, considered a capital offence of the firstdegree which, in the absence of any ameliorating circumstances, is punishable with death.	None
Such rigid categorisation would dangerously overlap the domain of legislative policy.	None
It may necessitate, as it were, a redefinition of murder?	None
or its further classification.	None
Then, in some decisions, murder by firearm, or an automatic projectile or bomb, or like weapon, the use of which creates a high simultaneous risk of death or injury to more than one person, has also been treated as an aggravated type of offence.	None
No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating circumstances is possible.	None
But this much can be said that in order to qualify for inclusion in the category of ?aggravating circumstances?	None
which may form the basis of ?special reasons?	None
in Section 354(3), circumstance found on the facts of a particular case, must evidence aggravation of an abnormal or special degree.	None
206.	None
Dr Chitale has suggested these mitigating factors?Mitigating circumstances In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases, the court shall take into account the following circumstances That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.	None
The age of the accused.	None
If the accused is young or old, he shall not be sentenced to death.	None
The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society.	None
The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated.	None
The State shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions (3) and (4) above.	None
That in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused believed that he was morally justified in committing the offence.	None
That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person.	None
That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.?	None
We will do no more than to say that these are undoubtedly relevant circumstances and must be given great weight in the determination of sentence.	None
Some of these factors like extreme youth can instead be of compelling importance.	None
In several States of India, there are in force special enactments, according to which a ?child?, that is, ?a person who at the date of murder was less than 16 years of age?, cannot be tried, convicted and sentenced to death or imprisonment for life for murder, nor dealt with according to the same criminal procedure as an adult.	None
The special Acts provide for a reformatory procedure for such juvenile offenders or children.?	None
Further in the three Judge Bench Judgment of this Court, in the case of Machhi Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab 1983(3) SCC 470 , this Court has considered tests to determine ?rarest of rare?	None
case, to impose death sentence under Section 302 IPC.	None
In the aforesaid judgment, this Court has held that the following questions may be asked and answered, in order to apply the guidelines indicated in Bachan Singh case, where the question of imposing the death sentence arises.	None
(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence for imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence?	None
(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances, which speak in favour of the offender?	None
In this judgment, it is held by this Court that the guidelines indicated in Bachan Singh case, will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each individual case, where the question of imposing death sentence arises.	None
Paragraph 38 of the said judgment reads as under 38.	None
In this background the guidelines indicated in Bachan Singh case will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposing of death sentence arises.	None
The following prepositions emerge from Bachan Singh case The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability.	None
(ii) Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender?	None
also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the crime?.	None
(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception.	None
In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances.	None
(iv) A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.	None
In this judgment, on facts, by holding that it is a coldblooded, calculated and gruesome multiple murders, as a reprisal in a family feud and 17 helpless, defenceless, innocent men, women and children were gunned down while asleep on the same night in quick succession in different neighbouring villages, confirmed the death sentence imposed on Machhi Singh and two others.	None
In this case, learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the Trial Court as well as the High Court, fell in error in confining nature and brutality of crime alone, to award the sentence of death.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that nature of crime alone is not sufficient to impose the sentence of death, unless State proves by leading cogent evidence that the convict is beyond reform and rehabilitation.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the socioeconomic conditions of the convict and the circumstances under which crime is committed are equally relevant for the purpose of considering whether a death penalty is to be imposed or not.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that as the case on hand, rests on circumstantial evidence, same is also the ground not to impose capital punishment, of death.	Arguments of Petitioner
13.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of his argument, learned counsel for the appellant has relied on the three Judge Bench Judgment of this Court, in the case of Kalu Khan v. State of Rajasthan , wherein the accused was charged for offence of abduction, rape and murder of 4 year old 6(2015) 16 SCC 492 girl child, death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Paragraphs 32 and 33 of the said judgment reads as under In our considered view, in the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has rightly noticed that life and death are acts of the divine and the divines authority has been delegated to the human courts of law to be only exercised in exceptional circumstances with utmost caution.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, that the first and foremost effort of the Court should be to continue the life till its natural end and the delegated divine authority should be exercised only after arriving at a conclusion that no other punishment but for death will serve the ends of justice.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have critically appreciated the entire evidence in its minutest detail and are of the considered opinion that the present case does not warrant award of the extreme sentence of death to the appellantaccused and the sentence of life imprisonment would be adequate and meet the ends of justice.	Arguments of Petitioner
We are of the opinion that the four main objectives which the State intends to achieve, namely, deterrence, prevention, retribution and reformation can be achieved by sentencing the appellantaccused for life.	Arguments of Petitioner
33.	Arguments of Petitioner
Before parting, we would reiterate the sentiment reflected in the following lines by this Court in Shailesh Jasvantbhai case Shailesh Jasvantbhai v. State of Gujarat, (2006) 2 SCC 359 (2006) 1 SCC (Cri) 499 (SCC pp.	Arguments of Petitioner
36162, para 7)?7.	None
Protection of society and stamping out criminal proclivity must be the object of law which must be achieved by imposing appropriate sentence.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, law as a cornerstone of the edifice of order? should meet the challenges confronting the society.	Arguments of Petitioner
Friedman in his Law in a Changing Society stated that State of criminal law continues to be as it should be a decisive reflection of social consciousness of society.?	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, in operating the sentencing system, law should adopt the corrective machinery or deterrence based on factual matrix.	Arguments of Petitioner
By deft modulation, sentencing process be stern where it should be, and tempered with mercy where it warrants to be.?	Arguments of Petitioner
In the case of Lehna v. State of Haryana (2002) 3 SCC 76 , it was held that the special reasons for awarding the death sentence must be such that compel the court to conclude that it is not possible to reform and rehabilitate the offender.	Arguments of Petitioner
Paragraph 14 of the said judgment reads as under Death sentence is ordinarily ruled out and can only be imposed for ?special reasons?, as provided in Section 354(3).	None
There is another provision in the Code which also uses the significant expression ?	Arguments of Petitioner
special reason?.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is Section 361.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 360 of the 1973 Code reenacts, in substance, Section 562 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898, (in short ?	Arguments of Petitioner
the old Code?).	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 361 which is a new provision in the Code makes it mandatory for the court to record ?special reasons?	Arguments of Petitioner
for not applying the provisions of Section 360.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 361 thus casts a duty upon the court to apply the provisions of Section 360 wherever itis possible to do so and to state ?	Arguments of Petitioner
special reasons?	Arguments of Petitioner
if it does not do so.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the context of Section 360, the ?special reasons?	Arguments of Petitioner
contemplated by Section 361 must be such as to compel the court to hold that it is impossible to reform and rehabilitate the offender after examining the matter with due regard to the age, character and antecedents of the offender and the circumstances in which the offence was committed.	Arguments of Petitioner
This is some indication by the legislature that reformation and rehabilitation of offenders and not mere deterrence, are now among the foremost objects of the administration of criminal justice in our country.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 361 and Section 354(3) have both entered the statutebook at the same time and they are part of the emerging picture of acceptance by the legislature of the new trends in criminology.	Arguments of Petitioner
It would not, therefore, be wrong to assume that the personality of the offender as revealed by his age, character, antecedents and other circumstances and the tractability of the offender to reform must necessarily play the most prominent role in determining the sentence to be awarded.	Arguments of Petitioner
Special reasons must have some relation to these factors.?	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel for the appellant has also relied on the three Judge Bench Judgment of this Court, in the case of Sunil v. State of Madhya Pradesh (2017) 4 SCC 393 , wherein the accused, aged about 25 years at the relevant time, was charged for offence of rape and murder of 4 year old child, death sentence was commuted to that of life imprisonment.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the said judgment, this Court has held that one of the compelling mitigating circumstances that must be acknowledged in favour of the appellant is his young age at which he had committed the crime and further that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated, are the other circumstances which could not but have been ignored by courts below.	Arguments of Petitioner
16.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance is also placed by learned counsel for the appellant, on the three Judge Bench Judgment of this Court, in the case of Rajendra Pralhaderao Wasnik v. State of Maharashtra Review Petition (Criminal) Nos. 306307 of 2013 , where accused was found guilty of rape and murder of 3 year old child, death sentence was substituted by life imprisonment, with a rider that the convict shall not be released from custody for the rest of his normal life.	Arguments of Petitioner
The aforesaid three judgments relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant, supports the case of the appellant, when we consider to balance the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of this case on hand.	None
From the deposition of PW9, it is clear that he is a fruit vendor, residing in Nutan Vasahat area, Jalna and the appellant also resides in the same lane.	None
Further, it is also clear from his deposition that accused was under influence of liquor, on the day of occurrence of crime.	None
As such, it is clear that on the day of occurrence, he was under influence of liquor and he is aged about 25 years and he had no previous history of any crimes and in absence of any evidence from the side of the prosecution to show that he cannot be reformed and rehabilitated to bring in to the main stream of the society, the judgments relied on by learned counsel for the appellant, fully support the case of the appellant, to modify the sentence.	None
In the case of Review Petition (Criminal) Nos. 306307 of 2013 Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab , this Court has confirmed that the death sentence to Machhi Singh and two others, mainly by recording a finding that it was a coldblooded, calculated and gruesome murders, as a reprisal in a family feud, in which, 17 helpless, defenceless, innocent men, women and children were gunned down, as such, same can be termed as ?rarest of rare?	None
case.	None
In the case on hand, it cannot be said to be a pre planned and premeditated one.	None
To record a finding that a particular crime committed is a preplanned and premeditated one, something more is required of planning to commit a murder on a day earlier to the date of occurrence.	None
In the case on hand, where it is clear from the evidence onrecord that the appellant was under influence of liquor and committed the offence, cannot be termed as a preplanned one, to count the same as an aggravating circumstance, for balancing aggravating and mitigating circumstances.	None
In the case of Sandesh v. State of Maharashtra (2013) 2 SCC 479 , this Court, once again, acknowledged the principle that it is for the prosecution to lead evidence, to show that there is no possibility that the convict cannot be reformed.	None
Similarly, in Mohinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2013) 3 SCC 294 , it was held in Paragraph 23 of the judgment as under As discussed above, life imprisonment can be said to be completely futile, only when the sentencing aim of reformation can be said to be unachievable.	None
Therefore, for satisfying the second aspect to the ?rarest of rare? doctrine, the court will have to provide clear evidence as to why the convict is not fit for any kind of reformatory and rehabilitation scheme.?	None
In the case of Sushil Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2014) 4 SCC 317 , this Court acknowledged that among various factors, one of the factors required to be taken into consideration, for awarding or not awarding capital punishment, is the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the convict.	None
This acknowledgment was made in paragraph 103 of the judgment, which reads as under ?103.	None
In the nature of things, there can be no hardandfast rules which the court can follow while considering whether an accused should be awarded death sentence or not.	None
The core of a criminal case is its facts and, the facts differ from case to case.	None
Therefore, the various factors like the age of the criminal, his social status, his background, whether he is a confirmed criminal or not, whether he had any antecedents, whether there is any possibility of his reformation and rehabilitation or whether it is a case where the reformation is impossible and the accused is likely to revert to such crimes in future and become a threat to the society are factors which the criminal court will have to examine independently in each case.	None
Decision whether to impose death penalty or not must be taken in the light of guiding principles laid down in several authoritative pronouncements of this Court in the facts and attendant circumstances of each case.?	None
In the case of Amit v. State of Maharashtra (2003) 8 SCC 93 , this Court adverted to the prior history of the accused and noted that there is no record of any previous heinous crime and also there is no evidence that he would be a danger to the society if the death penalty is not awarded to him.	None
Paragraph 10 of the said judgment reads as under ?10.	None
The next question is of the sentence.	None
Considering that the appellant is a young man, at the time of the incident his age was about 20 years he was a student there is no record of any previous heinous crime and also there is no evidence that he will be a danger to the society, if the death penalty is not awarded.	None
Though the offence committed by the appellant deserves severe condemnation and is a most heinous crime, but on cumulative facts and circumstances of the case, we do not think that the case falls in the category of rarest of the rare cases?	None
In the case of Surendra Pal Shivbalakpal v. State of Gujarat 2005(3)	None
SCC 127 , this Court has held that the involvement in any previous criminal case by the accused, was considered to be a factor, to be taken into consideration, for the purpose of awarding death sentence.	None
Paragraph 13 of the said judgment reads as under The next question that arises for consideration is whether this is a ?rarest of rare case?	None
we do not think that this is a ?rarest of rare case?	None
in which death penalty should be imposed on the appellant.	None
The appellant was aged 36 years at the time of the occurrence and there is no evidence that the appellant had been involved in any other criminal case previously and the appellant was a migrant labourer from U.P. and was living in impecunious circumstances and it cannot be said that he would be a menace to society in future and no materials are placed before us to draw such a conclusion.	None
We do not think that the death penalty was warranted in this case.	None
We confirm conviction of the appellant on all the counts, but the sentence of death penalty imposed on him for the offence under Section 302 IPC is commuted to life imprisonment.?	None
Further, this case on hand, rests solely on the circumstantial evidence.	None
In the case of Bishnu Prasad Sinha v. State of Assam (2007) 11 SCC 467 , this Court has held that ordinarily, death penalty would not be awarded, if the guilt of the accused is proved by circumstantial evidence, coupled with some other factors that are advantageous to the convict.	None
Paragraph 55 of the said judgment reads as under ?	None
55.	None
The question which remains is as to what punishment should be awarded.	None
Ordinarily, this Court, having regard to the nature of the offence, would not have differed with the opinion of the learned Sessions Judge as also the High Court in this behalf, but it must be borne in mind that the appellants are convicted only on the basis of the circumstantial evidence.	None
There are authorities for the proposition that if the evidence is proved by circumstantial evidence, ordinarily, death penalty would not be awarded.	None
Moreover, Appellant 1 showed his remorse and repentance even in his statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.	None
He accepted his guilt.?	None
Further, in the case of Aloke Nath Dutta v. State of West Bengal (2007)12 SCC 230 , the principle that death penalty should ordinarily not to be awarded, in a case arising out of circumstantial evidence, was broadly accepted with the rider that there should be some ?special reason?	None
for awarding death penalty.	None
Paragraph 174 of the said judgment reads as under ?174.	None
There are some precedents of this Court e.g. Sahdeo v. State of U.P.(2004) 10 SCC 682 and Sk.	None
Ishaque v. State of Bihar(1995) 3 SCC 392 which are authorities for the proposition that if the offence is proved by circumstantial evidence ordinarily death penalty should not be awarded.	None
We think we should follow the said precedents instead and, thus, in place of awarding the death penalty, impose the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for life as against Aloke Nath.	None
Furthermore we do not find any special reason for awarding death penalty which is imperative.?	None
In the case of Swamy Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka (2007) 12 SCC 288 , this Court has held that the convictions based on seemingly conclusive circumstantial evidence, should not be presumed to be foolproof.	None
Paragraph 87 of the said judgment reads as under ?	None
87.	None
It has been a fundamental point in numerous studies in the field of death penalty jurisprudence that cases where the sole basis of conviction is circumstantial evidence, have far greater chances of turning out to be wrongful convictions, later on, in comparison to ones which are based on fitter sources of proof.	None
Convictions based on seemingly conclusive circumstantial evidence should not be presumed as foolproof incidences and the fact that the same are based on circumstantial evidence must be a definite factor at the sentencing stage deliberations, considering that capital punishment is unique in its total irrevocability.	None
Any characteristic of trial, such as conviction solely resting on circumstantial evidence, which contributes to the uncertainty in the culpability calculus, must attract negative attention while deciding maximum penalty for murder.?	None
From the above judgments referred, it is clear that in a case of conviction based on circumstantial evidence, ordinarily the extreme punishment of death penalty should not be imposed.	None
In a given case, guilt of the accused is proved beyond reasonable doubt, by establishing chain of circumstances, resulting in conviction, such cases, by considering balancing aspects of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, in appropriate cases, death penalty can be imposed.	None
But, at the same time ordinarily, if no special reasons exist, in a case of conviction based on circumstantial evidence, death penalty should not be imposed.	None
In this case on hand, the conviction of the appellant is mainly based on circumstantial evidence.	None
On this ground also, I am of the view that the death sentence, imposed on him, is to be modified.	None
From the materials placed on record, it is clear that accused is a permanent resident of Indira Nagar, Jalna.	None
The father of the deceased, PW9, himself has stated that he is a fruit vendor in Nutan Vasahat area, Jalna, and accused also resides in the same lane, nearby his residence.	None
It is also clear from the evidence of PW9, to the East and West side of the house of the appellant, a person having buffaloes used to reside at the relevant time.	None
From such evidence on record, it is easy to assess the socioeconomic condition of the appellant and it can certainly be said that he is a person below poverty line.	None
In a judgment of this Court, in the case of Sunil Damodar Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra (2014) 1 SCC 129 , while holding that court must not only look at the crime but also offender and to give due consideration to circumstances of offender, has further held that in imposing penalty, socioeconomic condition can be considered as one of the mitigating factors, in addition to those indicated in Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh.	None
Para 20 of the said judgment reads as under When there are binding decisions, judicial comity expects and requires the same to be followed.	None
Judicial comity is an integral part of judicial discipline and judicial discipline the cornerstone of judicial integrity.	None
No doubt, in case there are newer dimensions not in conflict with the ratio of the larger Bench decisions or where there is anything to be added to and explained, it is always permissible to introduce the same.	None
Poverty, socio economic, psychic compulsions, undeserved adversities in life are thus some of the mitigating factors to be considered, in addition to those indicated in Bachan Singh Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684 1980 SCC (Cri) 580 and Machhi Singh Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab,(1983) 3 SCC 470 1983 SCC (Cri) 681 cases.	None
Thus, we are bound to analyse the facts in the light of the aggravating and mitigating factors indicated in the binding decisions which have influenced the commission of the crime, the criminal, and his circumstances, while considering the sentence.	None
In view of the aforesaid judgments of this Court and evidence on record in this case, which establishes the socioeconomic condition of the appellant, as a person below poverty line, can also be considered as one of the mitigating factors, while balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors.	None
I am conscious of recent amendments carried out to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short POCSO Act?), by way of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Amendment Act, 2019.	Reasoning
By virtue of the said amendments, taking note of increasing trend of crimes against the children, minimum sentence is increased for various offences and for offence under Section 6 of the Act i.e aggravated penetrative sexual assault, minimum imprisonment, which shall not be less than 20 years, which may extend to natural life or penalty of death.	None
Prior to the amendments made by recent amending Act of 2019, for offence under POCSO, death penalty was not provided.	None
By virtue of the amendments made in appropriate cases, for offences falling under provisions of the POCSO Act alone, a penalty of death sentence can be imposed.	None
In the case on hand, the offence was committed prior to coming into force, of the Act.	None
