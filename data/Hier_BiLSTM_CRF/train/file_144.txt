Facts

The motive of the incident is apparently clear.	Facts

We have heard learned Senior Counsel for the appellant and also learned counsel for the state.	None
Learned Senior Counsel would complain that there is no evidence against the appellant for convicting him for the offences, he has been found guilty of.	Arguments of Petitioner
He complained that the Courts below have erred in placing reliance upon PW5 who allegedly overheard the conversation between the five accused persons by standing outside the house of one of them.	Arguments of Petitioner
He points out that the witness could not be believed.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is pointed out that PW1 who was cited by the prosecution to prove the said conversation has not adhered to the version which was sought to be attributed to him.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is highly improbable that PW5 could have overheard any such conversation.	Arguments of Petitioner
He pointed out that a clear discrepancy in regard to the recovery of the mobile phone from the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the memorandum relating the alleged recovery of the mobile phone, what is stated is that the appellant took one mobile phone make of Nokia of the deceased and he has hidden the same on the roof of his house.	Arguments of Petitioner
The seizure memo reveals the following as what was recovered table He would then point out that the High Court, in the recital of circumstances, has found that a Cell Phone Number 9928120429 was found missing, and then he points out the eighth circumstance, which is noted by the Court, is that one mobile phone, bearing SIM Number 97321820, was recovered from the appellant.	None
Therefore, the phone that was seized from the appellant was not the phone number which was mentioned by the son of the deceased, PW3, as was being used by his father.	None
He further pointed out about the mysterious maxi found at the premises.	None
In this regard, we may notice the following findings by the Trial Court It is argued on behalf of defence that one blood stained and sleeveless maxi of white colour having lines of brown colour, the lower portion of the same is blood stained and the same is used is seized by the police wide Ex P6 from the place of occurrence, while there was no woman present at the place of occurrence.	Arguments of Petitioner
In such a situation, on account of seizure of maxi from the place of occurrence, the presence of any woman at the time of the incident is proved, but who was that woman, the prosecution did not produce any evidence in this regard hence, the prosecution case is doubtful.	Arguments of Petitioner
Only recovery seizure of blood stained maxi from the place of occurrence does not make doubtful to the prosecution case.	Arguments of Petitioner
Human blood was detected on the shirt of deceased and on the said maxi, there is no evidence that there was blood of any other person on the maxi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Because the wife of the deceased Rukmani Sharma is alive and Rukmani Sharma (Pw8) has admitted in her cross examination that she used to go occasionally to the house place of occurrence at Bilaua.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this sitation where there are visits of the wife of deceased in the house then this probability could not be denied that the said maxi would be of the wife of the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this situation from the seizure of maxi from place occurrence the incident could not be doubtful.	Arguments of Petitioner
He would point out that the Investigating Officer admitted that he did not carry out any investigation regarding the maxi.	Arguments of Petitioner
He would further contend that there is no evidence, as far as the appellant is concerned, to convict him of the offences.	Arguments of Petitioner
The evidence, even according to the prosecution witnesses, show that the other accused, viz., Veeru, Virendra and Kalli, were known to the prosecution witnesses as persons who would frequent the house of the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
As far as the appellant is concerned, there is no such evidence.	Arguments of Petitioner
In short, the contention is that the case is one where the appellant is convicted without any evidence and the injustice may be set right.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra, learned Counsel for the State supported the judgment.	Arguments of Respondent
As already noticed the appellant stands convicted under Section 460, 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC and Section 394 read with Section 34 of the IPC.	Reasoning
This is besides convicting the appellant under Sections 13 and 14 of the Madhya Pradesh Adhiniyam.	Reasoning
The case hinges entirely on circumstantial evidence.	Reasoning
Though eleven circumstances have been enlisted by the High Court, the circumstances Nos. 2 and 3 relate to the prosecution version as to the discovery of the death of the deceased by his son and his wife.	Reasoning
They relate to going to the place of his residence, finding out the dead body and the lodging of the FIR.	Reasoning
Circumstance No. 5 also does not amount to a circumstance.	Reasoning
Equally, we are not convinced that the circumstance No. 7, viz., that the accused cannot get benefit for the inaction latches of the investigation, can amount to a piece of circumstantial evidence for the prosecution to discharge its burden to prove the case against the accused.	Reasoning
The circumstances, which can be culled out, can be put as follows The deceased died in his house where he was living alone, as a result of shock and hemorrhage from 6 incised wounds as noticed and proved by medical evidence.	Reasoning
The death is homicidal too.	Reasoning
There were valuable articles, namely, a silver necklace, gold earring and two mobile phones which were found missing too.	Reasoning
These articles have been recovered from the accused as already mentioned.	Reasoning
A knife stood recovered from Kalli, one of the accused.	Reasoning
The other valuable articles identified by the closed relative, namely, his wife and his son stood recovered.	Reasoning
From the articles so recovered, one mobile phone was recovered from the appellant.	Reasoning
There is evidence of prosecution witnesses that out of the five accused, viz., Kalli, Veeru and Virendra used to frequent the house of the deceased.	Reasoning
The over hearing of the conversation by PW5 amongst the accused prior to the death of the deceased about their plans to commit loot theft from the house of the deceased is another circumstance relied upon.	Reasoning
WHETHER A MOBILE PHONE WAS RECOVERED BASED ON STATEMENT BY APPELLANT PW12 has deposed that on 01.11.2008, after arresting the appellant and on enquiry in custody, he (appellant) made StatementP13 to the effect that the looted mobile seized was hidden on the loft of his room and he would recover the same.	Reasoning
He further deposed that appellant took the looted mobile from the loft and he prepared the Seizure Memo.	Reasoning
In the crossexamination, he states that the seized mobile was of the deceased.	Reasoning
He further stated that no documents were produced.	Reasoning
He denied that he had planted the mobile from anywhere and false proceedings have been done.	Reasoning
PW7 has been examined to prove, inter alia, that he was called to the Police Station, and after 15 to 20 days of the proceedings relating to the recovery of the knife from Kalli, enquiry was made from the person, who he has told was Sonuappellant.	Reasoning
On making enquiry, he gave an information in respect of the mobile.	Reasoning
He deposed that he has signed on the StatementP13 the Statement purportedly to be under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter referred to as, the Evidence Act, for short).	Reasoning
He also admits that he had signed on the Seizure Memo prepared based on the StatementP14.	Reasoning
Thus, PW7 and PW12 prove that a statement was given by the appellant while in custody.	Reasoning
Based on the statement, a mobile phone was recovered from the appellant.	Reasoning
The recovery was from his house.	Reasoning
It was not from an open space.	None

xxx xxx	None
In our judgment no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to what inference should be drawn from a certain circumstance.	None
Where, however, the only evidence against an accused person is the recovery of stolen property and although the circumstances may indicate that the theft and the murder must have been committed at the same time, it is not safe to draw the inference that the person in possession of the stolen property was the murdered.	None
Suspicion cannot take the place of proof.	None

In Baiju v. State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1978 SC 522 , the Court held The question whether a presumption should be drawn under illustration (a) of S. 114 of the Evidence Act is a matter which depends on the evidence and the circumstances of each case.	None
Thus the nature of the stolen article, the manner of its acquisition by the owner, the nature of the evidence about its identification, the manner in which it was dealt with by the appellant, the place and the circumstances of its recovery, the length of the intervening period, the ability or otherwise of the appellant to explain his possession, are factors which have to be taken into consideration in arriving at a decision.	None
That was a case where the Court found that prosecution had proved the case.	None
This Court, in Shri Bhagwan v. State of Rajasthan AIR 2001 SC 2342 , held The possession of the fruits of the crime, recently after it has been committed, affords a strong and reasonable ground for the presumption that the party in whose possession they are found is the real offender, unless he can account for such possession in some way consistent with his innocence.	None
It is founded on the obvious principle that if such possession had been lawfully acquired, that party would be able to give an account of the manner in which it was obtained.	None
His unwillingness or inability to afford any reasonable explanation is regarded as amounting to strong, selfinculpatory evidence.	None
If the party gives a reasonable explanation as to how he obtained it, the courts will be justified in not drawing the presumption of guilt.	None
The force of this rule of presumption depends upon the recency of the possession as related to the crime and that if the interval of time be considerable, the presumption is weakened and more especially if the goods are of such kind as in the ordinary course of such things frequently change hands.	None
It is not possible to fix any precise period.	None
This Court has drawn similar presumption of murder and robbery in a series of decisions especially when the accused was found in possession of these incriminating articles and was not in a position to give any reasonable explanation.	None
Earabhadrappa v. State of Karnataka (1983) 2 SCC 330 1983 SCC (Cri) 447 was a case where the deceased Bachamma was throttled to death and the appellant was taken into custody and gold ornaments and other articles were recovered at his instance.	None
This Court observed (Para 13)	None
This is a case where murder and robbery are proved to have been integral parts of one and the same transaction and therefore the presumption arising under Illustration (a) to Section 114 of the Evidence Act is that not only the appellant committed the murder of the deceased but also committed robbery of her gold ornaments which form part of the same transaction.	None
PW5, WHO OVERHEARD THE CONSPIRATORIAL CONVERSATION In this case both the courts have apparently drawn strength from the testimony of PW5.	None
PW5 is a person whose evidence is virtually the sole testimony relied on to prove the conspiracy to commit theft robbery.	Reasoning
It is worthwhile to consider what he has deposed in Court.	Reasoning
He and Mohan Sharma, (who is PW1 and has turned hostile) at the house of Virendra Kushwah (Virendra is one of the accused in this case) found Virendra, Veeru Dheemar and three other persons sitting and talking.	Reasoning
When they (PW1, PW5) passed in front of the gate, he saw that they stopped talking.	Reasoning
Then they went little forward.	Reasoning
He told that these goondas miscreants (Badmaash) seem to be outsiders.	Reasoning
Let us listen to their conversation.	Reasoning
They heard, Virendra Kushwah and Veeru were saying to the three persons that Bharosilal is an old man and he has a lot of money and is living alone.	Reasoning
He and Veeru would remain here.	Reasoning
Kallithe appellant and Hariom would go to the house of the deceased to commit the theft.	Reasoning
Then they left from there.	Reasoning
Next day it was known that someone had killed Bharosilal.	Reasoning
In the evening of the next day he refrained from telling anyone because they were goondas.	Reasoning
Later on, he told the son of Bharosilal, whose name is Abhay, that these five accused have committed murder.	Reasoning
He identified them.	Reasoning
In cross, he says his house is far from where the goondas were making conversation.	Reasoning
On the 16 th day, when the Police came for inquiry, he told all the above things to the Police.	Reasoning
He himself did not tell by going to the Police Station.	Reasoning
He says that he has seen all the three persons (which apparently includes the appellant) at the Police Station.	Reasoning
On 16.10.2008, when he was called at the Police Station, at that time, all the three persons were sitting.	Reasoning
The arrest of the appellant, it may be noted, is made by PW12 only on 01.11.2008.	Reasoning
He deposed that he did not also see the accused persons at the Police Station.	Reasoning
The Police made inquiry in the office and these three accused persons were detained in the Police Station.	Reasoning
The police officials also not shown him the three accused persons at there.	Reasoning
He further says that when the accused persons were sent to jail, then S.I. had shown to him the accused persons in the vehicle.	Reasoning
The names of all the three were told and all the three were got identified.	Reasoning
He further says that he had got knowledge of the names of all the three persons when Police recorded his statement, i.e., after 8 to 10 days from 16.10.2008.	Reasoning
Then, he came to the name of the remaining three persons.	Reasoning
In earlier crossexamination on behalf of another accused, he has stated in his statement that till the Police recorded his statement.	Reasoning
He did not know about the residence of the three persons whose names he has told except Virendra and Veeru but they seemed to be outsiders.	Reasoning
He further says that he has no knowledge of the fact that the persons who were sitting in the house of Virendra, if they were uttering by taking wrong names of each other.	Reasoning
He, no doubt, says that there was light in the house of Virendra.	Reasoning
The light of the same was scattered.	Reasoning
In the case of recovery of an article from an accused person when he stands accused of committing offences other than theft also, (in this instance murder), what are the tests The first thing to be established is that the theft and murder forms part of one transaction.	Reasoning
The circumstances may indicate that the theft and murder must have been committed at the same time.	Reasoning
But it is not safe to draw the inference that the person in possession of the stolen property was the murderer See Sanwant Khan (supra) ii.	Reasoning
The nature of the stolen article iii.	Reasoning
The manner of its acquisition by the owner iv.	Reasoning
The nature of evidence about its identification The manner in which it was dealt with by the accused vi.	None
The place and the circumstances of its recovery vii.	Reasoning
The length of the intervening period viii.	Reasoning
Ability or otherwise of the accused to explain its possession See Baiju (supra).	Reasoning
In this case, applying the tests as above, we find as follows The appellant has not given any explanation as to how he came by possession of the mobile.	Reasoning
He has no explanation in his questioning under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the CrPC, for short) II.	Reasoning
As far as length of the intervening period is concerned, recovery was effected on 02.11.2008 whereas the date of the incident is 08.09.2008.	Reasoning
That means, a gap of less than two months.	Reasoning
The arrest of the appellant was effected on 01.11.2008, i.e., a day before the recovery III.	Reasoning
As far as nature of the article is concerned, it was a mobile phone which was capable of being transferred by mere delivery.	Reasoning
No doubt, it would contain a sim which may connect the phone with the previous owner or person in possession.	Reasoning
It is also common knowledge, however, that it may be open to the person, who possesses the mobile, to equip it with a new sim IV.	None
As far as identification is concerned, we have already seen the nature of the evidence It is not in dispute that the two mobile phones were kept and they were not mixed with any other similar looking mobile phones.	Reasoning
The appellant, along with the others, were charged under the offences with the aid of Section 34 of the IPC.	Reasoning
The finding by the Trial Court in this case is that there was a criminal conspiracy hatched to commit robbery.	Reasoning
As far as Section 34 is concerned, it proclaims the principle of vicarious criminal liability.	Reasoning
The soul of the Section, and the principle which underlies criminal liability for the acts of another therein, is the shared intention or the common intention to commit an offence.	Reasoning
The common intention must be for the very offence which the accused is charged with.	Reasoning
In this case, it is to be noted that though there is a charge of causing death by strangulation, the finding is that the death was caused as a result of the injuries inflicted with the knife.	Reasoning
The knife was, apparently, carried and wielded by the coaccusedKalli.	Reasoning
From him, in fact, the recovery of the knife was also effected which becomes all the more reason for us to conclude that it will be totally unsafe to convict the appellant of the charges of which he is found guilty including Section 302 of the IPC based only on the recovery of the mobile phone where the recovery itself suffers from suspicion and doubt.	Reasoning
We may, in this regard, notice the view expressed by this Court in Hardev Singh and others v. State of Punjab AIR 1975 SC 179  	None
The view of the High Court that even the person not committing the particular crime could be held guilty of that crime with the aid of Section 34 of the Penal Code if the commission of the act was such as could be shown to be in furtherance of the common intention not necessarily intended by every one of the participants, is not correct.	None
The common intention must be to commit the particular crime, although the actual crime may be committed by any one sharing the common intention.	None
Then only others can be held to be guilty (Emphasis supplied)	None
In Arun v. State by Inspector of Police, Tamil Nadu 2008 (15) SCC 501 , this Court, dealing with the case where Section 34 of the IPC was sought to be invoked against the appellant in the matter of committing the offence of murder.	None
No doubt, it was a case where there was no charge or evidence that he committed the murder.	None
This Court referred to the tests laid down in the decision in Dharam Pal v. State of Haryana 1978 (4) SCC 440 and we would refer to paragraphs 14 and 15 of the said judgment.	None
The same reads as under It may be that when some persons start with a prearranged plan to commit a minor offence, they may in the course of their committing the minor offence come to an understanding to commit the major offence as well.	None
Such an understanding may appear from the conduct of the persons sought to be made vicariously liable for the act of the principal culprit or from some other incriminatory evidence but the conduct or other evidence must be such as not to leave any room for doubt in that behalf.	None
A criminal court fastening vicarious liability must satisfy itself as to the prior meeting of the minds of the principal culprit and his companions who are sought to be constructively made liable in respect of every act committed by the former.	None
There is no law to our knowledge which lays down that a person accompanying the principal culprit shares his intention in respect of every act which the latter might eventually commit.	None
The existence or otherwise of the common intention depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.	None
The intention of the principal offender and his companions to deal with any person who might intervene to stop the quarrel must be apparent from the conduct of the persons accompanying the principal culprit or some other clear and cogent incriminating piece of evidence.	None
In the absence of such material, the companion or companions cannot justifiably be held guilty for every offence committed by the principal offender.	None
(Emphasis Supplied) As far as the presumption being drawn of common intention, we notice the judgment of this Court in Brijlal Pd.	None
Sinha v. State of Bihar 1998 (5) SCC 699 11The liability of one person for an offence committed by another in the course of a criminal act perpetrated by several persons will arise under Section 34 of the Penal Code, 1860 only where such criminal act is done in furtherance of a common intention of the persons who join in committing the crime.	None
Direct proof of common intention will, of course, be difficult to get and such intention can only be inferred from the circumstances.	None
But the existence of a common intention must be a necessary inference from the circumstances established in a given case.	None
A common intention can only be inferred from the acts of the parties.	None
Unless a common intention is established as a matter of necessary inference from the proved circumstances the accused persons will be liable for their individual act and not for the act done by any other person.	None
For an inference of common intention to be drawn for the purposes of Section 34, the evidence and the circumstances of the case should establish, without any room for doubt, that a meeting of minds and a fusion of ideas had taken place amongst the different accused and in prosecution of it, the overt acts of the accused persons flowed out as if in obedience to the command of a single mind.	None
If on the evidence, there is doubt as to the involvement of a particular accused in the common intention, the benefit of doubt should be given to the said accused person. .	None
In Girija Shankar v. State of U.P. 2004 (3)SCC 793 , this Court made the following observations In order to bring home the charge of common intention, the prosecution has to establish by evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that there was plan or meeting of minds of all the accused persons to commit the offence for which they are charged with the aid of Section 34, be it prearranged or on the spur of the moment but it must necessarily be before the commission of the crime (Emphasis supplied)	None
Thus, in this case, as far as the appellant is concerned, the evidence against him essentially consists of the recovery of the mobile phone and there is discrepancy about the number which we have noted.	Reasoning
PW5 has not taken the name of the appellant.	Reasoning
Essentially evidence of PW5 and the recovery is relied on to hold that the chain of circumstances is complete.	Reasoning
We have noticed the testimony of PW5.	Reasoning
The appellant is not mentioned as one of the persons who used to visit the deceaseds father though three of the other accused were named, viz., Veeru, Kalli and Virendra.	Reasoning
There is complaint from the appellant that no Test Identification Parade was conducted for the accused.	Reasoning
We have referred to what PW5 has deposed.	Reasoning
In the facts of this case, we are inclined to think that it would not be safe to uphold the conviction of the appellant.	Decision
He would be entitled to the benefit of doubt.	Decision
We allow the appeal.	Decision
The impugned judgment in so far as it relates to the appellant will stand set aside and he will stand acquitted.	Decision
The appellants bail bond shall stand discharged.	Decision
He will be set at liberty if his custody is not required in connection with any other case.	Decision
