 Ramaswami, J.1.	None
This appeal is brought by certificate from the judgment of the Kerala High Court in O. P. No. 934 of 1964.2.	Issue
The respondents are dealers in tobacco and tobacco preparation and are doing business in Mattancherry in the name and style of A. S. Bava, Tobacconist.	Facts
In the year 1909, Cochin Tobacco Act 7 of 1084 (M. E.) was enacted by the Maharaja of Cochin.	Facts
Section 4 of the that Act prohibited the transport, import or export, sale and cultivation of tobacco except as permitted by the Act and Rules framed thereunder.	Facts
Section 5 of the Act gave power to the Dewan to make rules from time to time consistent with the Act, to permit absolutely or subject to any condition the possession for sale, or cultivation of tobacco.	Facts
In pursuance of the power given by this section the Dewan was making rules from time to time relating to the matters specified in the act Cochin State was integrated with Travancore on April 1, 1950 in order to form the new State of TravancoreCochin.	Facts
On that date, after the Constitution came into force the State of TravancoreCochin.	Facts
became a Part B State and by the Finance Act, 1950 the Central Excises and Salt Act 1 of 1944 was extended to the TravancoreCochin State.	Facts
Section 13 (2) of the Act provided that if immediately before the first day of April, 1950 there was in force in any State other than Jammu and Kashmir a law corresponding to, but other than an Act referred to in subs.	Facts
(1) or (2) of S. 11, such law was repealed with effect from such date.	Facts
In consequence of this provision in the Finance Act, rules which were in force on April 1, 1950 were changed in Cochin and by a notification dated August 3, 1950 the system of auction sales of A and B Class shops was done away with and instead graded licence fees were introduced for various classes of licences including C class licences.	Facts
The State of TravancoreCochin was collecting licence fee from the respondents for the period from August 17, 1950 to December 31, 1957 on the strength of the said rules framed by the TravancoreCochin State.	Facts
In 1956 the respondents filed O. P. No. 70 of 1956 in the High Court of Kerala for the refund of the licence fee collected after April 1, 1950 on the ground that the Cochin Tobacco Act stood repealed by the Finance Act, 1950 because of the extension of the Central Excises and Salt Act 1 of 1944 to the Part B State of TravancoreCochin and in consequence the notifications issued in August 1950 and January 1951 framing new rules for the issue of licences and prescribing fees therefor under the powers conferred by the Cochin and Travancore Acts were ab initio void because the Acts under which the notifications were purported to be issued stood repealed from April 1, 1950.	Facts
The petition was opposed by the appellant on the ground that the Act and the rules were not repealed by the extension of the Central Excises and Salt Act 1 of 1944 to Travancore Cochin State.	Facts
The High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that the tax levied by virtue of the rules framed under the Travancore Cochin Tobacco Acts was not a duty of excise coming within the Union List but it was a tax on luxuries coming within Entry 62 of that State List.	Facts
The respondents took the matter in appeal to this Court which held that the rules framed under the Cochin Tobacco Act of 1084 (M. E.) and the Travancore Tobacco Regulation of 1087 (M.E.) requiring licences to be taken out for storage and sale of tobacco and for payment of licence fee in respect thereof were law corresponding to the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944 and hence were superseded on April 1, 1950 by virtue of S. 13 (2) of the Finance Act, 1950.	Facts
Consequently, the new rules framed in August 1950 and January 1951 for the respective areas of Cochin and Travancore for the issue of licences and payment of fee for storage of tobacco were invalid ab initio.	Facts
The Court did not consider it necessary to decide whether the Cochin and Travancore Acts were within the competence of the State Legislature under Entry 62 of List II for that question would only arise if those Acts were not repealed as corresponding law under S. 13 (2) of the Finance Act.3.	Facts
Soon after the decision of this Court the respondents complained to the appellant that a sum of Rupees 1,11,750 had been illegally collected as licence fee from 1125 to 1133 M. E. On April 29, 1962 the appellant refunded a sum of Rs. 73, 500/ but did not return the balance.4.	Facts
On December 16, 1963 the Government of Kerala promulgated Ordinance 1 of 1963 which was later replaced by Act 9 of 1964.	Facts
The Ordinance was promulgated in order to avoid the effect of the decision of this Court in A. B. Abdulkadir v. State of Kerala, 1962 Supp (2) SCR 741 (AIR 1962 SC 922 ) in respect of the period from August 17, 1950 to December 31, 1957.Section 3 of the Act providesFor the period beginning with the 17th day of August 1950 and ending on the 31st day of December, 1957 every person vending or stocking tobacco within any area to which this Act extends shall be liable and shall be deemed always to have been liable to pay a luxury tax on such tobacco in the form of a fee for licence for the vend and stocking of the tobacco, at such rates as may be prescribed not exceeding the rates specified in the schedule.

It was held by the High Court that in the absence of any production of tobacco inside the Kerala State it was not competent for the Kerala Legislature to impose a tax on tobacco imported from outside the State and therefore the provisions of the Luxury Tax on Tobacco (Validation Act) 1964 violated the guarantee contained in Arts.

It is necessary at this stage to set out the relevant Articles in Part XIII of the Constitution as it stood at the material timesArticle 301Subject to the other provisions of this part, trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free.	None
Article 302Parliament may by law impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be require in the public interest.	None
Article 304Notwithstanding anything in Article 301 or Article 303, the Legislature of a State may by law(a) impose on goods imported from other States (or the Union territories) any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject, so, however, as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced and(b) impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interestProvided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause (b) shall be introduced or moved in the Legislature of a State without the previous sanction of the President.7.	None
The true scope and effect of these Articles was the subjectmatter of consideration in Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam, (1961) 1	None
SCR 809 (AIR 1961 SC 232 ).	Reasoning
The majority view was expressed by Gajendragadkar J. at p. 860 as followsIn construing Art.	None
301 we must, therefore, have regard to the general scheme of our Constitution as well as the particular provisions in regard to taxing laws.	None
The construction of Article 301 should not be determined on a purely academic or doctrinaire considerations in construing the said Article we must adopt a realistic approach and bear in mind the essential features of the separation of powers on which our Constitution rests.	None
It is a federal constitution which we are interpreting, and so the impact of Art.	None
301 must be judged accordingly, Besides, it is not irrelevant to remember in this connection that the Articles we are construing imposes a constitutional limitation on the power of the Parliament and State Legislatures to levy taxes, and generally, but for such limitation, the power of taxation would be presumed to be for public good and would not be subject to judicial review or scrutiny.	None
Thus considered we think in would be reasonable and proper to hold that restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed by Art. 301, would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade.	None
Taxes may and do amount to restrictions but it is only such taxes as directly and immediately restrict trade that would fall within the purview of Art.	None
301.	Reasoning
The argument that all taxes should be governed by Articles 301 whether or not their impact on trade is immediate or mediate, direct or remote, adopts, in our opinion, an extreme approach which cannot be upheld.	None
If the said argument is accepted it would mean, for instance, that even a legislative enactment prescribing the minimum wages to industrial employees may fall under Part XIII because in an economic sense an additional wage bill may indirectly affect trade or commerce.	None
We are, therefore, satisfied that in determining the limits of the width and amplitude of the freedom guaranteed by Article 301 a rational and workable test to apply would be Does the impugned restriction operate directly or immediately on trade or its movement.?In the Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. v. The State of Rajasthan, (1963)	None
1 SCR 491 (AIR 1962 SC 1406 )	None
the view of Gajendragadkar J., was accepted as correct by the majority of the Judges.	None
The principle was reiterated by this Court in Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1968 Andh Pra 599.	None
In that case the question which arose was whether Section 21 of the Andhra Pradesh Sugar Cane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act which authorised the State Government to levy a tax at such rate not exceeding five rupees per metric tonne as may be prescribed on the purchase of cane required for use, consumption or sale in a factory was constitutionally valid.	None
It was held by this court that normally a tax on the sale of goods did not directly impede or hamper the flow of trade and Section 21 was no exception and was not violative of Article 301 of the Constitution.	None
A similar view was expressed in the State of Madras v. K. Nataraja Mudaliar, AIR 1969 SC 147 in which the question at issue was whether sections 8 (2) and 8 (5) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 were intra vires of Arts.	None
301 and 303 of the Constitution.	Facts
It was pointed out that an Act which was merely enacted for the purpose of imposing tax which was to be collected and to be retained by the State did not amount to a law giving or authorising the giving of, any preference to one State over another, or making, or authorising the making of, any discrimination between one State and another, merely because of varying rates of tax prevailing in different States.	None
At p. 156 of the report Shah J., speaking for the Court observedThe flow of trade does not necessarily depend upon the rates of sales tax it depends upon a variety of factors, such as the source of supply, place of consumption, existence of trade channels, the rates of freight, trading facilities, availability of efficient transport and other facilities for carrying on trade.	None
Instances can easily be imagined of cases in which notwithstanding the lower rate of tax in a particular part of the country goods may be purchased from another part, where a higher rate of tax prevails.	None
Supposing in a particular State in respect of a commodity the rate of tax is 2 per cent, but if the benefit of that low rate is offset by the freight which a merchant in another State may have to pay for carrying that commodity over a long distance, the merchant would be willing to purchase the goods from a nearer State even though the rate of tax in that State may be higher.	None
Existence of longstanding business relations, availability of communications, credit facilities and a most of other factors  natural and business  enter into the maintenance of trade relations and the free flow of trade cannot necessarily be deemed to have been obstructed merely because in a particular State the rate of tax on sales is higher than the rates prevailing in other State.8.	None
On behalf of the appellant it was contended that the High Court was not right in holding that the ratio of Kalyani Stores case, (1966) 1	Arguments of Petitioner
SCR 865 (AIR 1966 SC 1686 ) applied to the present case and, that, Kerala Act 9 of 1964 as violative of Art.	Arguments of Petitioner
301 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
The view taken by the High Court was that in the absence of any production of tobacco inside Kerala State it was not competent for the Kerala Legislature to enact the impugned Act under Article 304 (a) of the Constitution.	Reasoning
In support of this view the High Court relied upon the following passage from the judgment of this CourtExercise of the power under Article 304 (a) can only be effective if the tax or duty imposed on goods imported from other States and the tax or duty imposed on similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are such that there is no discrimination against imported goods.	None
As no foreign liquor is produced or manufactured in the State of Orissa the power to legislate given by Art.	None
304 is not available and the restriction which is declared on the ground of trade, commerce or intercourse by Art.	None
301 of the Constitution remains unfettered.9.	None
In our opinion the High Court has not correctly appreciated the import of the decision of this Court in the Kalyani Stores case, (1966) 1	Reasoning
SCR 865 (AIR 1966 SC 1686).	Facts
The appellant in that case challenged the imposition of a duty of excise on foreign liquor imported into the Orissa State which had been levied at Rs. 40 per L. P. Gallon until March 31, 1961 by virtue of a notification issued in 1937 under section 27 of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915 and which had been enhanced with effect from April 1, 1961 by a fresh notification.	Reasoning
It was contended on behalf of the appellant that since no foreign liquor was manufactured within the State and consequently no excise duty was being levied on any locally manufactured foreign liquor countervailing duty could not be charged on such liquor brought from outside the State and that the impost was in violation of Arts.	Reasoning
301, 303 and 304 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
It was held by the majority of Judges that the notification dated March 31, 1961 enhancing the levy by Rs. 30/ per L. P. Gallon infringed the guarantee of freedom under Art.	Reasoning
301 and may be saved only if it falls within the exception contained in Art. 304.	Reasoning
As no liquor was produced or manufactured within the State, the protection of Article 304 was not available.	Reasoning
The decision was based on the assumption that the notification dated March 31, 1961 enhancing duty on Foreign liquor infringed the guarantee under Art.	Reasoning
301 and may be saved if it fell within the exceptions contained in Art.	Reasoning
304 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
The Court did not intend to lay down the proposition that imposition of a duty or tax in every case would be tantamount per se to an infringement of Art.	Reasoning
301.	Reasoning
As we have already pointed out it is well established by numerous authorities of this Court that only such restrictions or impediments which directly or immediately impede the free flow of trade, commerce and intercourse fall within the prohibition imposed by Art. 301.	Reasoning
A tax may in certain cases directly and immediately restrict or hamper the flow of trade, but every imposition of tax does not do so.	Reasoning
Every case must be judged on its own facts and in its own setting of time and circumstance.	Reasoning
In the present case the High Court has not gone into the question whether the provisions of Act 9 of 1964 and the notification dated January 25, 1951 issued under the Cochin Tobacco Act constitute such restrictions or impediments as directly and immediately hamper free flow of trade, commerce and intercourse and, therefore, fall within the prohibition imposed under Art.	Reasoning
301 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Unless the High Court first comes to the finding on the available material whether or not there is infringement of the guarantee under Art.	Reasoning
301 of the Constitution the further question as to whether the statute is saved under Art. 304 (b) does not arise and the principle laid down by this Court in Kalyani Stores case, (1966) 1	Reasoning
SCR 865 (AIR 1966 SC 1686 ) cannot be invoked.10.	None
It was also said on behalf of the respondents that the State Legislature had no power to levy and collect licence fee under the impugned Act as it was in substance a duty of excise falling under the Union List.	Arguments of Respondent
The Contrary viewpoint was presented on behalf of the appellant and it was contended that the legislation falls under Entry 62 of List II and the State Legislature was competent to enact.	None
It is open to the parties to argue this matter before the High Court at the time of rehearing.11.	None
For the reasons already expressed we hold that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Kerala High Court dated October 3, 1966 in O. P. 934 of 1964 should be set aside and the case should go back for hearing in the light of the law laid down in this judgment.12.	Issue
It is desirable that the High Court should give an opportunity to the parties to file further affidavits before taking up the case for rehearing.13.	None
On behalf of the appellants Mr. Chagla has given an undertaking that the provisions of the Act would not be enforced against the respondents for a month from this date.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondents say that they will apply to the Keral High Court for stay in the meanwhile.14.	None
Appeal allowed.	Decision
