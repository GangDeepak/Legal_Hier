 JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J. Nagaraj Shivarao Karjagi, the petitioner in SLP No. 4415 of 1989 has challenged his compulsory retirement and in Writ Petition No. 1287 of 1989 he has questioned the validity of the direction dated 21 July 1984 issued by the Finance Ministry, Government of India.	Issue
Since the questions raised in both the cases are inter looked, we grant special leave in the SLP and proceed to dispose of the same along with the writ petition.	Issue
The events leading to these cases may briefly be stated.	Facts
In 1982, the petitioner was a Manager of the Syndicate Bank (the Bank) at East Patel Nagar Branch at New Delhi.	Facts
He discounted a cheque of the sum of Rs. 50, 000 drawn on Punjab National Bank, Madras, after obtaining, by phone prior approval of the Regional Divisional Manager of the Bank.	Facts
The cheque was sent for realisation to the Punjab National Bank at Madras, but it was returned unpaid.	Facts
The petitioner did not take prompt action to recover the amount from the person in whose favour he discounted the cheque.	Facts
He kept the cheque with him even without reporting to the higher authorities.	Facts
In 1983, the Assistant General Manager of the Bank called upon him to explain why the amount due under the discounted cheque has not been recovered.	Facts
The petitioner in his reply explained the circumstances under which the cheque was discounted.	Facts
He has stated that the credit was given to the account of one Dr. N. Ramakrishnan who was a Senoir Scientist in Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi but the amount was withdrawn by another person called A. Chandrashekhar who is an officer of the Bank.	Facts
He has further stated that A. Chandrashekhar has promised to pay the amount and therefore, he has retained the instrument with him hoping that A. Chandrashekhar would keep up his promise.	Facts
On 6 July 1984 a sum of Rs.52, 167.15 was deposited with the Bank.	Facts
A sum of Rs.36, 000 towards principal sum and Rs.16, 167.15 towards interest.	Facts
A suit was filed to recover a sum of Rs.14, 000 out of the principal amount.	Facts
And later on, this principal amount was also recovered and credited to the Bank.	Facts
However, in 1985 there was a departmental inquiry against the petitioner.	Facts
The Commissioner for Vigilance Inquiry from the Central Vigilance Commission conducted the inquiry.	Facts
The first charge against the petitioner was that when he was functioning as Manager, he discounted under his discretionary jurisdiction a cheque for Rs.50, 00 0 drawn in the name of Dr. N. Ramakrishnan in order to accommodate A. Chandrashekhar an officer of the Bank or others known to him.	Facts
The second charge framed against him, related to the retention of the discounted instrument with him from December, 1982 till January 1984 without taking causing to be taken any action to realise the amount due under the unpaid cheque.	Facts
It was also alleged that the petitioner made available undue financial accommodation to A. Chandrashekhar or others to the detriment of the interests of the Bank.	Facts
He was charged with lack of the integrity, honesty devotion to duty, diligence and conduct unbecoming of the status of Bank Officer in contravention of Regulation No. 3(1) of the Syndicate Bank Officer Employees (Conduct) Regulations, 1976.The inquiry was held as per the procedure prescribed by Syndicate Bank Officer Employees (Discipline Appeal) Regulations, 1976, (the Regulations).	Facts
On 16 October 1986, the Inquiry Officer submitted his report holding that the charges were proved against the petitioner.	Facts
He has held that the petitioner has failed to take any effective steps for recovery of the amount paid under the discounted instrument.	Facts
He has kept the instrument with himself for unduly long period without even surrendering the same to the custody of the Bank.	Facts
It was Only after the Additional General Manager reminded him by letter dated 15 December 1 983, the petitioner assured him that he would return the cheque which he finally did on 18 January 1984.	Facts
The Inquiry Officer has finally concluded that the transaction connected with the unpaid instrument was of an accommodative nature with a v iew to assist A. Chandrashekhar by using another person as benami and it was in clear violation of the rules of the Bank.	Facts
It is said and indeed not disputed that the Bank referred the matter to the Central Vigilance Commission for advice and the Commission has recommended that the petitioner may be compulsorily retired from service by way of punishment.	Facts
The disciplinary authority after considering the inquiry report and affording an opportunity to the petitioner passed an order dated 7 October 1987 imposing on the petitioner the penalty of compulsory retirement.	Facts
The petitioner appealed to the General Manager challenging the punishment.	Facts
On 27 August 1988 the General Manager dismissed the appeal concurring with the findings recorded and the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority.	Facts
The petitioner thereupon moved the Bombay High Court for relief under Article 226 of the Constitution.	Facts
The High Court has also dismissed the writ petition.	Facts
He has now appealed to this Court.	Facts
THE CONTENTIONS OF THE PETITIONER The petitioner has been complaining throughout and also before us that the punishing authorities did not apply their mind and did not exercise their power in considering the merits of his case.	Arguments of Petitioner
They have imposed on him the penalty of compulsory retirement in obedience to the advice of the Central Vigilance Commission which has been made binding on them by the direction dated 21 July 1984 issued by the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division).	Arguments of Petitioner
They have blindly followed the advice given by the Central Vigilance Commission without regard to the merits of the matter and contrary to the statutory Regulations governing the departmental inquiries.	Arguments of Petitioner
The subject matter of inquiry was only regarding irregularities in the banking practice and the action complained of has not affected the interests of the Bank.	Arguments of Petitioner
The petitioner by his own efforts has recovered the money due under the discounted cheque and credited the same with interest to the Bank.	Arguments of Petitioner
The findings recorded by the Inquiry Officer on the alleged misdemeanour does not warrant any major penalty like the compulsory retirement.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference was also made to certain representations said to have been made by the Bank to the Central Vigilance Commission for approval to impose a lesser punishment.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is said that the Bank pleaded in the representations that the punishment of compulsory retirement advised by the Commission was too harsh.	Arguments of Petitioner

THE DIRECTION OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS (BANKING DIVISION)	None
On 21 July 1984 Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division) has written a letter t o all Banking Institution thus Recently a case been reported where a bank has revised the punishment awarded to an officer in a disciplinary case contrary to the advice of the Central Vigilance Commission.	None
The case has figured in the Annual Report of the CVC as a case of non consultation with the Commission and thus created an embarrassing situation.	None
You will, perhaps, be aware of the Annual Reports of the CVC , which contain cases where the disciplinary authorities had not accepted its recommendations or had not consulted it, are laid on the Tables of both the Houses of Parliament.	None
This may, thereafter be discussed in the Parliament also.	None
You will agree that under no circumstances the advice of the CVC should be modified except with the prior concurrence of the commission and this Ministry.	None
I may mention here that revision of the penalty imposed on a delinquent officer as a result of an appeal filed by him before the appellate authority against the decision of the original disciplinary authority also a mounts to nonconsultation non acceptance of the advice of the CVC and is included in CVCs Annual Report.	None
Kindly circulate these instructions to the concerned officers in your bank for strict compliance.	None
The receipt of this D.O. letter may please be acknowledged.	None
A copy of this D.O. letter is being marked to CVO in your bank separately.	None
CIRCULARS OF THE BANK On 27 July 1984, A. Krishna Rao, Chairman and managing Director of the Bank, issued a circular to all branches of the Bank as follows I am enclosing herewith a photostat copy of the DO letter No.41/3/84Vig.	None
dated 21.7.1984 received by me from Shri Ashok Kumar, joint Secretary, ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, (Banking Division), Vigilance Cell, New Delhi, in the above connection for strict compliance of the instructions contained therein.	None
As the advice in vigilance cases received from Central Vigilance commission is communicated to the authorities concerned by the Chief Vigilance Officer, I advise, that the Chief Vigilance Officers advice, as explained in my above referred to DO letter, should be complied with.	None
Even when a revision of the penalty imposed on a delinquent officer at the advice of the Chief Vigilance Officer by of Original Disciplinary Authority were to be considered as a result of an appeal filed by him before the appellate high authorities, such revision shall be effected only after consulting the Chief Vigilance Officer.	None
Please acknowledge receipt of this and ensure compliance of the instructions contained herein.	None
On 8 September 1986 P.S.V. Mallya, the succeeding Chairman and Managing Director of the bank issued another circular letter to all branches of the bank in the following terms All vigilance cases in bank are being investigated processed at Vigilance Cell at the HO, under the administrative control of the Chief Vigilance Officer, who is reporting directly to me.	None
After processing of the reports is concluded, the cases are referred to Central Vigilance Commission as per the existing procedure and the advice received from the commission is being communicated to the Disciplinary Appellate Authority by the Chief Vigilance Officer.	None
If the advice tendered by the Commission is not accepted acted upon, it will amount to non acceptance of the advice of the Commission and such instance will figure in the Annual Report of the Central Vigilance Commission placed before the Parliament.	None
This apart the nonacceptance of the advice in vigilance cases is likely to lead to a situation, in which, different types of decisions are possible to be taken in similar cases, which is sure to result in a voidable complications and injustice to certain sections of the Officers employees community.	None
Again in such a situation, ensuring uniform stantards in finalising action on vigilance cases will also become a very difficult phenomenon, which is not a desirable trend and does not augur well for the healthy functioning of the vigilance machinery in the Bank.	None
I therefore, advice all Disciplinary Appellate Authorities to see that they refer as hitherto all vigilance cases to Chief Vigilance Officer and consult him on such cases and act upon his advice.	None
xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx	None
If for any reasons, the authorities concerned feel that the advice needs to be reconsidered or a departure is called for, they may refer back the matter to Chief Vigilance Officer for reconsideration of the advice, with the reasons for such disagreement and the Chief Vigilance Officer will see whether and to what extent such reconsideration is desirable or feasible and will tender advice again on reconsideration.	None
If the authority concerned is still not disposed to act on the advice, the disinclination on the part of the authority concerned will have to be brought to my notice and the advice given by me in respect of such cases shall be treated as final.	None
It is also necessary that the authorities concerned should for obvious reasons keep the advice in strict confidence and see that no reference thereof is made in any of the correspondence communication, whether emanating from their end.	None
The petitioner being aw are of the directions of the Ministry of Finance and the circulars issued by the Bank has in his memo of appeal before the appellate authority inter alia complained that the system and procedure adopted by the Bank in dealing with vigilance cases, is totally against the principles of natural justice.	Reasoning
The Bank has no control over such cases.	Reasoning
The Disciplinary Authority and Appellate Authority are required to carry into effect the punishment advised by the Central Vigilance commission without change.	Reasoning
He has also pointed out that his appeal could be nothing but an empty formality as the appellate authority would be also bound by the decision of the Central Vigilance commission.	None
The petitioner has also added post script to his appeal Memo stating thus This appeal has been filed without prejudice to my contention that this appeal is an exercise in futility as the appellate authority also is not the deciding authority and this appeal also will be decided by the CVO CVC, who ha s already decided and whose decision is binding on you.	None
There is in fact no effective right of appeal.	None
Counsel for the Bank however, submits that notwithstanding the advice of the Central Vigilance Commission and the directive dated 21 July 1984 of the Ministry Finance, Department of Economy Affairs (Banking Division), the case of the petitioner has received the fullest consideration from the disciplinary and appellate authorities.	Arguments of Respondent
They have independently considered the material on record both on the articles of charges and also on the appropriate punishment of compulsory retirement imposed on the petitioner.	Arguments of Respondent
The orders of the authorities do not refer to the circulars of the Bank, nor to the punishment proposed by the Central Vigilance Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
It is therefore, illegitimate, to contend that the punishment imposed on the petitioner has been vitiated by extraneous influences.	Arguments of Respondent
We are not even remotely impressed by the arguments of counsel for the Bank.	Arguments of Respondent
Firstly, the Bank itself seems to have felt as alleged by the petitioner and not denied by the Bank in its counter that the compulsory retirement recommended by the Central Vigilance Commission was too harsh and excessive on the petitioner in view of his excellent performance and unblemished antecedent service.	Arguments of Respondent
The Bank appears to have made two representations one in 1986 and another in 1987 to the Central Vigilance Commission for taking a lenient view of the matter and to advise lesser punishment to the petitioner.	Arguments of Respondent
Apparently, those representations were not accepted by the Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
The disciplinary authority and the appellate authority therefore have no choice in the matter.	Arguments of Respondent
They had to impose the punishment of compulsory retirement as advised by the Central Vigilance Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
The advice was binding on the authorities in view of the said directive of the Ministry of Finance, followed by two circulars issued by the successive Chief Executive of the Bank.	Arguments of Respondent
The disciplinary and appellate authorities might not have referred to the directive of the Ministry of Finance or the Bank circulars.	Arguments of Respondent
They might not have stated in their orders that they were bound by the punishment proposed by the Central Vililance Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
But it is reasonably foreseeable and needs no elaboration that they could not have ignored the advice of the Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
They could not have imposed a lesser punishment without the concurrence of the Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
Indeed, they could have ignored the advice of the Commission and imposed a lesser punishment only at their peril.	Arguments of Respondent
The power of the punishing authorities in departmental proceedings is regulated by the statutory Regulations.	None
Regulation 4 merely prescribes diverse punishment which may be imposed upon delinquent officers.	None
Regulation 4 does not provide specific punishments for different misdemeanours except classifying the punishments as minor or major.	None
Regulations leave it to the discretion of the punishing authority to select the appropriate punishment having regard to the gravity of the misconduct proved in the case.	None
Under Regulation 17, the appellate authority may pass an order confirming, enhancing, reducing or completely setting aside the penalty imposed by the disciplinary authority.	None
He has also power to express his own views on the merits of the matter and impose any appropriate punishment on the delinquent officer.	None
It is quasijudicial power and is unrestricted.	None
But it has been completely fettered by the direction issued by the Ministry of Finance.	None
The Bank has been told that the punishment advised by the Central Vigilance Commission in every case of disciplinary proceedings should be strictly adhered to and not to be altered without prior concurrence of the Central Vigilance Commission and the Ministry of Finance.	None
We are indeed surprised to see the impugned directive issued by the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division).	None
Firstly, under the Regulation, the Banks consultation with Central Vigilance Commission in every case is not mandatory.	None
Regulation 20 provides that the Bank shall consult the Central Vigilance Commission wherever necessary, in respect of all disciplinary cases having a vigilance angle.	None
Even if the Bank has made a self imposed rule to consult the Central Vigilance Commission in every disciplinary matter, it does not make the Commissions advice binding on the punishing authority.	None
In this context, reference may be made to Article 320(3) of the Constitution.	None
The Article 320 (3) like Regulation 20 with which we are concerned provides that the Union Public Service Commission or the State Public Commission, as the case may be, shall be consultedon all disciplinary matters affecting a civil servant including memorials or petitions relating to such matters.	None
This Court in A.N. DSilva v. Union of India, 1962 Suppl 1 SCR 968 has expresed the view that the Commissions function is purely advisory.	None
It is not an appellate authority over the inquiry officer or the disciplinary authority.	None
The advice tendered by the Commission is not binding on the Government.	None
Similarly, in the present case, the advice tendered by the Central Vigilance Commission is not binding on the Bank or the punishing authority.	None
It is not obligatory upon the punishing authority to accept the advice of the Central Vigilance Commission.	None
Secondly, the Ministry of Finance, Government of India has no jurisdiction to issue the impugned directive to Banking institutions.	None
The government may regulate the Banking institutions within the power located under the banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970 .	None
So far as we could see, Section 8 is the only provision which empowers to the Government to issue directions.	None
Section 8 reads Every corresponding new bank shall, in the discharge of its function, be guided by such directions in regard to matters of policy involving public interest as the Central Government may, after consultation with the Governor of the Reserve bank, give.	None
The corresponding new bank referred to in Section 8 has been defined under Section 2(f) of the Act to mean a banking company specified in column 1 of the First Schedule of the Act and includes the Syndicate Bank.	Reasoning
Section 8 empowers the Government to issue direction in regard to matters of po licy	Reasoning
but there cannot be any uniform policy with regard to different disciplinary matters and much less there could be any policy in awarding punishment to the delinquent officers in different cases.	Reasoning
The punishment to be imposed whether minor or major depends upon the nature of every case and the gravity of the misconduct proved.	Reasoning
the authorities have to exercise their judicial discretion having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case.	Reasoning
They cannot act under the dictation of the Central Vigilance Commission or of the Central Government.	Reasoning
No third party like the Central Vigilance Commission or the Central Government could dictate the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority as to how they should exercise their power and what punishment they should impose on the delinquent officer.	Reasoning
(See De Smiths Judicial Review of Administrative Action, Fourth Edition, p. 309).	Reasoning
The impugned directive o	Reasoning
f the Ministry of Finance, is therefore, wholly without jurisdiction, and plainly contrary to the statutory Regulations governing disciplinary matters.	None
For the foregoing reasons, we allow the appeal and the writ petition quashing the directive issued by the Finance Ministry, Department of Economic Affairs, (Banking Division) dated 21 July 1984.	Decision
We also issue a direction to the Chairman of the Syndicate Bank to withdraw the circular letters dated 27 July 1984 and 8 September 19 86.	Decision
We further set aside the impugned orders of the disciplinary authority and appellate authority with a direction to the former to dispose of the petitioners case in accordance with law and in the light of the observation made.	Decision
The petitioner is entitled to costs which we quantify in both the cases at Rs. 15, 000 which shall be paid by the Central Government.	Decision
Appeal and petition allowed.	Decision
