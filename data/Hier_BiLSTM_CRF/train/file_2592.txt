 Saghir Ahmad, J. The Madhya Pradesh High Court, in a Public Interest Litigation, instituted under Article 226 of the Constitution, has directed, by the impugned judgment dated 16.12.1996, that the dairies, located on the outskirts of the Jabalpur City, be shifted from their present location to the alternative sites.	Issue
This judgment was passed in the writ Petition in which the following reliefs were claimed  (a) to direct the respondents to take appropriate, effective and immediate steps to remove the Cow Buffalo dung and urine from the pipe line of water filtration plant at Lalpur, Gwarighat(b) direct the respondents to ensure that in future also no storage of Cow Buffalo dung and urine of animals may be done on the water supply pipe line of Lalpur, Gwarighat as stated in the body of the petition(c) direct the respondents to take appropriate steps against the persons who have stored these hazardous materials on the water supply pipe lines(d)	Facts
Any other order orders, writ writs or direction directions that this Honble Court may deem fit and proper, may also kindly be given.	Facts
The principal ground on which the petition was founded was that the main water pipelines, which supplied water, after its filtration at Lalpur Filtration Plant, to the Jabalpur City, passed through the place where a number of dairyowners had started storing the cow buffalo dung and waste of the dairy products, and that too, near the pipelines which was likely to contaminate the pure water supplied to the residents of the City for home consumption.	Facts
On this aspect, the High Court recorded the following findings  We called the Public Health Engineering persons and the Corporation Authorities.	Facts
The Corporation Authorities informed us that proceedings under Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were taken against these persons and against Shri Manohar Singh Marwaha.	Facts
Against Marwaha Dairy final order has been passed which is also the subject of revision before the Sessions Judge, Jabalpur in which interim order has been passed by the Sessions Judge restraining the M.P. Electricity Board from disconnection of their power supply.	Facts
We also sought reports from the Public Health Engineering Department, Revenue Authorities and Corporation Authorities and after considering the matter, we find that keeping all these dairies around these water supply lines is a great hazard to the lives of the people of Jabalpur, because most of them get water from these pipelines on which cow buffalo dungs are being stored by the dairy owners as a result of which there is every likelihood of pollution in the town by the supply of polluted water.	Facts
The High Court, thereafter, considered the question of rehabilitating the dairyowners at some other place and passed the following order on a consideration of the case of each dairyowner individually We, therefore, explored the possibility of rehabilitating these dairy owners from the present location so that cow buffalo dung may not pollute the water supply lines.	None

None
Since there is no material on record on this aspect, we consider it appropriate to direct the Central Water Pollution Control Board to depute a specialist who may, after inspecting the site, suggest measures which can be taken for treatment of cowdung and the urine of the cattle to prevent it from flowing above the pipeline and exclude the possibility of contamination of the water passing through the pipeline.

A copy of Resolution dated 21.10.1997 is marked as Annexure R41.	None
That as per the resolution of Standing Committee, Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur some of the dairies have been removed and the proceeding of removal of dairies is still under process.	None
The proceedings of the meeting of the Municipal Corporation which adopted a Resolution on 21.10.1997, was also annexed which indicated that the Municipal Corporation had adopted a Resolution that all dairies within the Municipal limits must be removed from the city of Jabalpur by the end of November, 1997.	None
It was also resolved that dairies at Lalpur near the Public Health Engineering Pipeline should also be removed because a number of complaints regarding pollution caused in the drinking water pipeline were received.	None
It may be stated that Madhya Pradesh Cattle (Control) Act, 1978 was enforced within the Municipal limits of Jabalpur with effect from 27th January, 1978, and in the Notification issued by the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, on September 24, 1979, it was stated that the cattle could not be kept within the limits of Jabalpur Municipal Corporation, except in the villages which were specified in the list set out in the Notification.	None
This list included Gwarighat and Lalpur villages also but in pursuance of the Resolution adopted by the Municipal Corporation on 21.10.1997, both the villages, namely, Gwarighat and Lalpur, were taken out of the list of excepted villages vide Notification published in the Govt.	None
Gazette on 19.3.1999.	None
In view of the above Notification, by which the villages of Gwarighat and Lalpur were excluded from the excepted villages, where cattle could be kept, it is contended by Mr. Anoop G. Choudhary, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh, that the petitioners have to shift outside the Municipal limits of Jabalpur city, if they, at all, intend to keep their dairies, but the dairies, particularly at the spot at which they have established their business cannot be permitted to be run or maintained, not only for the reason that both the villages, namely, Gwarighat and Lalpur fall within the limits of Municipal Corporation and have, in the meantime, become densely populated, but also for the reason that keeping of cattle in the close proximity of the main pipeline which supplies drinking water from Lalpur Filtration Plant to the city of Jabalpur, would be hazardous to the health of the people on account of the possibility of the water carried through that pipeline being contaminated by the Gobar (cowdung) as also the urine of the hundreds of cattle kept there by the petitioners.	Arguments of Respondent
This is also the stand of the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, on whose behalf Mr. Ranjan Mukherjee, learned counsel made submissions, that in the face of the exercise of statutory power by the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, by which the establishment of dairies or the keeping of cattle within the limits of Municipal Corporation, has been totally prohibited, the petitioners cannot contend that they are still entitled to retain their dairies at the disputed sites.	Arguments of Respondent
Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners has, on the other hand, contended that the Resolution dated 31.10.1997, which was adopted by Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, was a colourable exercise of power, inasmuch as the exclusion of Gwarighat and Lalpur from the excepted villages as detailed in the Notification issued in 1978, has been done only during the pendency of the present petitions in this Court in which an interim order was also granted that the judgment of the High Court would not be implemented.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended that the proceedings in this regard cannot be rendered nugatory by adopting the Resolution that the dairies could not be run in Gwarighat and Lalpur villages.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended that since the Resolution was adopted only to harm the interests of the petitioners whose rights were under adjudication by this Court in the present proceedings, the same is liable to be quashed and cannot be given effect to.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also contended that the list of excepted villages set out in the Notification of 1978 contained many villages, but the Resolution was adopted only in respect of Gwarighat and Lalpur villages where the present petitioners are running their dairies.	Arguments of Petitioner
No reason, it is contended, has been shown by the Municipal Corporation why dairies are still permitted to be run in other villages, although those other villages also fall within the Municipal limits of Jabalpur.	Arguments of Petitioner
It appears that there has been previous litigation between the parties with regard to the running of dairies which, at that time, were being run by the petitioners within the Municipal limits of Jabalpur.	Reasoning
In 1971, a writ petition for the shifting of dairies was filed in the Madhya Pradesh High Court which by its judgment dated 6.2.1976 framed a scheme directing the Corporation to reserve three plots outside the Municipal limits of Jabalpur where the dairyowners would shift their dairies.	Reasoning
On account of the dispute having arisen between the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur and the dairyowners with regard to the development charges which the dairyowners were required to pay, another writ petition was filed in the Madhya Pradesh High Court by about 89 dairyowners.	None
Since a choice was given to the dairyowners to make their own arrangement for establishing and running their duties outside the Municipal limits of Jabalpur, the writ petition as dismissed by the High Court on 2.1.1976.	None
It was, thereafter that the dairyowners purchased plots of land outside the Municipal limits and established their dairies.	Reasoning
The plots of land were purchased by the petitioners in villages Lalpur and Gwarighat in 1982 and they shifted their dairies to those villages which had already been excepted from the operation of the Madhya Pradesh Cattle (Control) Act, 1978.18.	Reasoning
The petitioners have set out in the present petitions that one Shri K.K. Nayakar, a Mimicry Artist of repute, purchased a plot of land and constructed a house at Gwarighat which was at a distance of about 500 metre from the dairy of one of the petitioners and as Shri Nayakar did not like the presence of dairies near his house, he filed a complaint under Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the SubDivisional Magistrate, Jabalpur, for the removal of nuisance created by the petitioners.	Reasoning
While the proceedings were pending before the SubDivisional Magistrate under Section 133 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a writ petition was filed in the Madhya Pradesh High Court which ultimately resulted in the judgment which is being impugned before us.19.	Reasoning
From the facts set out above, it will be seen that when the Special Leave Petitions were filed in this Court, the villages Lalpur and Gwarighat were in the list of excepted villages where dairies could be established and run and cattle could be kept.	Reasoning
Since it was stated in the writ petition that the main water pipeline from the Filtration Plant at Lalpur passed nearby the dairies set up by the petitioners on account of which the drinking water was likely to be contaminated by the Gobar (cowdung) and urine of hundreds of cattle kept there, this Court, while entertaining the Special Leave Petitions, considered the possibility of a project being devised so as to prevent altogether the possibility of pollution contamination of water carried through pipelines already embedded about four feet below the surface of the earth.	Reasoning
It was for this reason that this Court by its order dated 7.11.1997 directed the Central Pollution Control Board to consider this matter and to report whether the likelihood of pollution to the drinking water carried by the pipeline in question could be ruled out by any device suggested by it.	Reasoning
On the submission of the Report of the Central Pollution Control Board, which was also supported by the State Pollution Control Board, the Court directed a project to be prepared for that purpose.	Reasoning
On the submission of the Project Report, since it was given out by the petitioners that they would implement the project and carry out all other recommendations made by the Central Pollution Control Board, the Court directed the petitioners to implement the project which included, inter alia, the setting up of a Gobar Gas (Bio Gas) Plant.	Reasoning
The petitioners, apart from making a payment of Rs. 93,000/ to the Central Pollution Control Board towards its Inspection Fee etc., also took up the construction of a Gobar Gas Plant and entered into an agreement for purchase of certain additional land as suggested by the Central Pollution Control Board.	Reasoning
Time to complete the construction of the Gobar Gas Plant was extended from time to time by this Court and ultimately an affidavit was filed on behalf of the petitioners that the Gobar Gas Plant has been constructed and established.	Reasoning
The construction was carried out under the supervision of the Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam as directed by this Court and Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam also submitted its progress report.	Reasoning
An affidavit to the effect that the Gobar Gas Plant had become functional was also filed before the Court.	Reasoning
The cost of construction of the Gobar Gas Plant which was incurred by the petitioners is more than Rs. 5 lakhs.20.	Reasoning
While these proceedings were pending in this Court, the Municipal Corporation adopted a Resolution to exclude from the list of excepted villages the two villages where the dairies in question are situate, namely, Lalpur and Gwarighat, so that the dairies may be shifted from these two villages and established elsewhere outside the limits of Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur.	Reasoning
An affidavit to this effect was, for the first time, filed on behalf of the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, in March 1998.	Reasoning
But the Notification issued on the basis of that Resolution was still not filed before the Court and this has been placed before the Court during the course of the arguments.	Reasoning
While it is contended on behalf of the petitioners that the Resolution adopted by the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, and the consequent Gazette Notification issued on its basis were liable to be quashed on account of the abuse of power, or to put it differently, on account of colourable exercise of power, it is maintained on behalf of the State Govt.	Arguments of Petitioner
as also the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, that the Resolution was adopted in the interest of public health and could not be said to be a colourable exercise of power merely because the proceedings were pending in this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Supply of pure drinking water is the statutory duty of the Municipal Corporation and the supply of such water has to be ensured to every citizen.	Reasoning
In a situation, where the interest of the community is involved, the individual interest must yield to the interest of the community or the general public.	Reasoning
Since the Cattle (Control) Act, 1978 is already in force within the Municipal limits of Jabalpur city, the dairies cannot be established and cattle cannot be kept so as to cause public nuisance in contravention of the statutory provisions.	Reasoning
But the Court cannot also overlook the fact that the petitioners, who had already been uprooted from one place, and that too, at the dictate of the judiciary, had established dairies at a place at which such activity was not prohibited.	Reasoning
In the list of villages appended to the Notification issued under the Cattle (Control) Act, 1978, Lalpur and Gwarighat were the villages, besides other villages, where such activity could be legally carried on.	Reasoning
These villages were taken out of that list during the pendency of the present proceedings by virtue of a Resolution adopted by the Municipal Corporation on 21.10.1997.	Reasoning
The petitioners have already invested huge sums in setting up a Gobar Gas Plant at an expense of more than Rupees Five lakhs and have also incurred an expense of Rs. 93,000/ towards Inspection Fee of the Central Pollution Control Board in pursuance of the order passed by this Court.23.	Reasoning
The validity of the Resolution dated 21.10.1997 as reflected in the Gazette Notification dated 19.3.1999 cannot be legally adjudicated upon in these proceedings on the oral submissions made by Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned Senior Counsel, who also pointed out that although the Resolution was adopted only in respect of Lalpur village, the Notification published in the Gazette mentions Gwarighat village also.	Reasoning
If the Notification is intended to be challenged by the petitioners, they have to initiate appropriate proceedings in which they have to set out the foundation for such challenge so that the State Govt.	Reasoning
or, for that matter, the Municipal Corporation may have adequate opportunity of submitting their reply, particularly as they have also to explain why only these two villages were taken out of the list of excepted villages set out in the Notification of 1978 and why the activity of establishing dairies in other villages was not prohibited, although those other villages were also within the Municipal limits of Jabalpur city.	Reasoning
Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we dispose of these Special Leave Petitions by providing as under.	Decision
In view of the Notification published in the Govt.	None
Gazette on 19.3.1999, milk dairies and the keeping of cattle at the place in question, or for that matter, in villages Lalpur and Gwarighat, cannot be permitted to continue nor can anyone be permitted to establish it in those villages specially in the proximity of the main pipeline through which drinking water is supplied to the city of Jabalpur.(b)	Decision
Whether the Notification published in the Govt.	Decision
Gazette dated 19.3.1999 is valid or not cannot be decided in the present proceedings as there are no pleadings in that regard.	Decision
It will be open to the petitioners to challenge the Notification by instituting appropriate proceedings questioning its validity on all the grounds which have been orally urged before us, including the ground that the Notification reflected a colourable exercise of power in the hands of the Municipal Corporation, or that it intended to interfere with the proceedings pending in this Court, but such proceedings shall have to be instituted by the petitioners within three months from the date of this judgment.	Decision
The interim orders passed by this Court in these petitions shall continue for another period of three months and two weeks thereafter, to enable the petitioners to approach the High Court and make appropriate application for interim relief.(c)	Decision
Since the Notification dated 19.3.1999 was issued by the Municipal Corporation during the pendency of these proceedings at a stage when this Court had already allowed the petitioner to set up the Bio Gas Plant and the petitioner in SLP(C)	Decision
No. 2927/97 has incurred an expenditure of Rs. 5,86,000/, the Municipal Corporation, Jabalpur, shall, after deducting the amount of subsidy as may have already been paid by the Government, pay that amount to the petitioner in the Special Leave Petition (C) No. 2927 of 1997 at the time of their shifting to the new locations pursuant to the Notification dated 19.3.1999 and in the event of their challenge to the said Notification being turned down by the High Court.	Decision
He and petitioner No. 1 in Special Leave Petition (C) No. 2926 of 1997 will also be entitled to all the benefits indicated by the High Court in the impugned judgment while dealing with the individual cases of the petitioners.(d)	Decision
The petitioners, namely, Mr. Shiv Kumar Patel and Hari Ram Rajak in S.L.P. (C) No. 2926/97 have indicated their willingness to shift to new locations in terms of the judgment passed by the High Court.	Decision
Consequently, the Special Leave Petition on their behalf shall be treated to have been dismissed as not pressed.	Decision
Petition dismissed.	None
