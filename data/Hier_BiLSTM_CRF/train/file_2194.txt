Issue
The contention of Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 2452/92 and Transferred Case (C) Nos. 811/1989 was that the 1987 Act affected the constitution and organisation of the High Court by abolishing original civil jurisdiction of the High Court and as such it was beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature because such a legislation is within the exclusive legislative competence of Parliament under Entry 78 List I of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
In his submissions on this point, he traced the history of working of High Court and City Civil Court and Letters Patent jurisdiction of High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of his submissions, he cited few decisions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Alternatively, he urged that even if the 1987 Act was intravires having regard to lack of infrastructure including requisite judges in City Civil Court it was an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of statutory power vested in the Government to bring into operation the 1987 Act and hence the Government Notification dated 20.8.1991 bringing into operation the 1987 Act was illegal.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also added that the said Notification was issued by the Government under pressure for collateral and extraneous reasons only to appease a section of agitating lawyers who went on hunger strike etc.	Arguments of Petitioner
Elaborating his submission on point no.1, he submitted that it is only the Parliament which has the exclusive legislative competence under Entry 78 of List I to make a law relating to the constitution and organization of the High Courts.	Arguments of Petitioner
The State Legislature has, however, the concurrent legislative powers to legislate in respect of the constitution and organization of all courts excepting the Supreme Court and the High Courts as per Entry 11A of List III prior to 3.1.1977, the State had exclusive legislative competence to constitute and organize courts other than the Supreme Court and the High Courts under Entry 3 of List II which was amended to transfer it to Entry 11A in List III by the Constitution 42nd Amendment Act, 1976.	Reasoning
According to the learned Senior Counsel, the general jurisdiction of a civil court as opposed to its special jurisdiction in respect of a particular subject matters relates to the constitution of a court and flows from the very Act constituting it.	None
Thus, the general jurisdiction of the High Court is the subject covered by Entry 78 of List I falling within the exclusive legislative competence of Parliament.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, the general jurisdiction of a court other than the Supreme Court and the High Court is a subject that was under Entry 3 of List II prior to the Constitution 42nd Amendment Act, 1976.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also contended that the State Legislature has also the legislative competence to make laws conferring special jurisdiction on courts or taking away such special jurisdiction from courts in respect of subjects in the Lists II and III by virtue of Entry 65 or Entry 46 respectively this, however, is not general jurisdiction of a court arising from its constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
He cited the decision of State of Bombay vs. Narothamdas Jethabhai and another (1951 SCR 51 ) to show how the scheme relating to jurisdiction of Court was explained.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel also urged that Constitution of a court of law necessarily includes its general jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
No court can be constituted without jurisdiction jurisdiction and constitution of a court are inseparable otherwise it would be an ineffective institution in name only the ordinary dictionary meaning of the word constitution of a court is sufficient wide to include the jurisdiction of a court.	Arguments of Petitioner
In common parlance also, if a court is to be constituted, it must necessarily be constituted with its heart and soul, namely, its jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
Consequently, a law in its true content and purport relating to the jurisdiction of the High Court can only be made by Parliament.	Arguments of Petitioner
The 1987 Act abolishes the general civil jurisdiction of the High Court affecting its constitution, therefore, it was beyond the competence of the State Legislature inasmuch as the constitution and organization of the High Courts is vested in the Union Parliament.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel drew our attention to the scheme of the constitution of courts under Govt.	Arguments of Petitioner
of India Act, 1935	Arguments of Petitioner
and submitted that the scheme under the Act relating to the Constitution and organization of the High Courts was different.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Provincial Legislature had the exclusive legislative competence to make law relating to the constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court (under Entry 2 of List II of the Provincial List).	Arguments of Petitioner
Consequently, the Provincial Legislature had the legislature competence to constitute a court including a High Court and to legislate in respect of its jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
This being the position, this Court in Narothamdas Jethabhai (supra) upheld the validity of the Act as validly made under Entry 1 List III of the Govt.	Arguments of Petitioner
of India Act, 1935.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also drew our attention to certain passages in the case of Narothamdas Jethabhai relating to word constitution of a court.	Arguments of Petitioner
He stated that the words constitution of court as explained in Narothamdas Jethabhai was followed in a subsequent judgment of this Court in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee representing undertrial prisoners etc. vs. Union of India and others (1994) 6 SCC 731 )	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, according to him, Parliament alone could make law abolishing the general original civil jurisdiction of an existing High Court as it directly and substantially related to its constitution which is a subject falling in exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament under Entry 78 of List I of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
He took pains to explain as to the scope and ambit of different Entries in three Lists touching the subject in controversy and reason for the Constitution 42nd Amendment Act of 1976 in relation to Entry No.3 of List II as amended and creating a new Entry 11A in List III.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him the change was brought about deliberately so that Parliament alone should be given the power under the scheme of the Constitution to make legislation which substantially affected the constitution and organization of the higher judiciary.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, several other provisions of the Constitution also support this view.	Arguments of Petitioner
For instance, Article 230 read with Entry 79 of List I gives Parliament the exclusive competence to deal with extension of the jurisdiction of a High Court to and exclusion of jurisdiction of a High Court from, in Union Territory.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also referred to Articles 216, 217, 221, 222, 223 and 224 to show that the President of India and Govt.	Arguments of Petitioner
of India alone have powers in respect of the matters stated in those Articles to secure a unified higher judiciary in matters provided in these Articles.	Arguments of Petitioner
Although the 1987 Act on its face purports to State that it is only enhancing the general jurisdiction of Bombay City Civil Court, in effect it abolishes the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Court of Bombay in entirety.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Govt. of India has taken the same stand as the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
In Geetika Panwar vs. Government of NCT of Delhi and others, (99 (2002) DLT 840 (FB), the Full Bench of Delhi High Court has taken the view which supports the case of the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
Subsequently, accepting the position, Parliament has made a law in regard to High Court of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel also submitted that the 1987 Act cannot be held to be constitutionally valid even on the principle of pith and substance of the legislation.	Arguments of Petitioner
On ground No.2, the learned Senior Counsel reiterated that for want of necessary infrastructure including the requisite number of judges in the City Civil Court, it was an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of statutory power vested in the Government to bring into operation the 1987 Act by issuing the impugned Notification dated 20.8.1991.	Arguments of Petitioner
Facts and figures are also given in this regard relating to number of civil suits pending as on 31.12.2002 in the City Civil Court even at the existing limits of pecuniary jurisdiction i.e. Rs. 50,000/.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him the City Civil Court has been unable to cope with the load of its existing criminal jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court also specifically stated that 110 Judges were required for City Civil Court in addition to necessary infrastructure if the Act is to be brought into force.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the absence of infrastructure and the required number of Judges, Civil Court can not cope with the workload and it cannot be functional.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Senior Counsel on ground No.3 submitted that because of the agitation by a section of lawyers, the Notification dated 20.8.1991 was issued out of pressure and other considerations which according to him cannot be sustained.	Arguments of Petitioner
If it is allowed to stand, it will lead to difficulty and anomalous situation resulting in greater hardship to the litigants and even administration of justice will suffer.	Arguments of Petitioner
Instead of a speedy disposal, the cases may be pending considerably for a long time in City Civil Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. K.K. Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Bombay City Civil Sessions Court Bar Association, made submissions supporting the impugned judgment upholding the constitutional validity of 1987 Act.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, Entry 77 in list I deals with the constitution, organization, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Entry 78 deals with only constitution and organization of the High Courts and not with jurisdiction and powers of the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Jurisdiction and powers of the High Courts are dealt with as a separate topic, namely, administration of justice under Entry 11A of the Concurrent List which was originally in Entry 3 of the State List.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, the general jurisdiction of the High Courts thus falls under administration of justice covered by Entry 11A in the Concurrent List.	Arguments of Respondent
He further submitted that Entry 95 of the Union List, Entry 65 of the State List and Entry 46 of the Concurrent List refer to special jurisdiction of courts with respect to the matters contained in the respective Lists.	Arguments of Respondent
Entry 95 of List	Arguments of Respondent
I deals with the power of the Parliament to confer jurisdiction and power of all the courts except the Supreme Court with respect to any of the matters in List I. Entry 65 of the List II deals with the power of State Legislature to confer jurisdiction and powers of all the courts excepting the Supreme Court with respect to the matters contained in the State List.	Arguments of Respondent
Similarly Entry 46 in the Concurrent List deals with the power and jurisdiction of all the courts excepting the Supreme Court with respect to all the matters contained in the Concurrent List.	Arguments of Respondent
One of the items in the Concurrent List is Civil Procedure Code under Entry 13.	Reasoning
According to him the State Legislature has the power and legislative competence to confer general jurisdiction on all the courts except the Supreme Court under Entry 11A in the Concurrent List under the caption administration of justice.	None
Thus, passing of the 1987 Act was within the competence of the State Legislature.	Arguments of Respondent
The State Legislature was the sole repository of power to confer jurisdiction on all the courts excepting the Supreme Court under Entry 3 of the State List prior to Fortysecond Amendment Act, 1976 and thereafter both Parliament as well as the State Legislature have power to confer general jurisdiction on all the courts including the High Courts under Entry 11A of the Concurrent List.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Counsel submitted that the subject relating to constitution and organization of High Courts does not include jurisdiction and powers of the High Court it is only with reference to establishment or constitution of the High Court having regard to Articles 2, 3 and 4 and other relevant Articles of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
He added that the expression administration of justice has a wide meaning and includes administration of civil as well as criminal justice and is complete and selfcontained Entry.	Arguments of Respondent
The words administration of justice are of widest amplitude and are sufficient to confer upon the State Legislature the right to regulate and provide for entire machinery connected with the administration of justice in the State.	Arguments of Respondent
The State Legislature being an appropriate body to legislate in respect of the administration of justice and to invest all courts within the State including the High Court with general jurisdiction and powers in all matters  civil and criminal  it must follow that it can invest the High Court with such general jurisdiction and powers including territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction and also be take away such jurisdiction and powers from the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Conferring unlimited jurisdiction on civil court or taking away the same from the High Court does not amount to dealing with the constitution and organization of the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Under Entry 11A List III, State Legislature was empowered to confer jurisdiction and powers upon all courts within the State including the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Entry 46 of the Concurrent List deals with the special jurisdiction in respect of the matters in List III.	Arguments of Respondent
One of the items in the said list at serial No. 13 is Civil Procedure Code on the commencement of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
The 1987 Act deals with the pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts as envisaged by Sections 6 and 9 of the Civil Procedure Code and as such the State Legislature was competent to legislate under Entry 13 of List III.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of his submission, the learned Counsel relied on a few decisions.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. U.U. Lalit, learned senior counsel for the State of Maharashtra, while supporting the impugned judgment submitted that there is an anomaly created by or deficiency found in Section 3 of the 1986 Act inasmuch as Section 3 of the Act read with Section 9 of 1987 Act fails to make any provision for appeal against a decree or order passed after the commencement of the Act in any suit or other proceedings pending in the High Court since before the commencement of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
He sought ten days time to have instructions from the State of Maharashtra in this regard.	Arguments of Respondent
Thereafter, on the basis of the letter No. 37PF 2131097 dated 17th December, 2004 of Principal Secretary R.L.A., State of Maharashtra, I.A. No. 10 is filed seeking permission to place on record the said letter indicating the willingness of the State of Maharashtra to take necessary steps to make legislative amendment to Section 3 of the Maharashtra Act No. XVII of 1986, relevant portions of which read With reference to the above subject, I have to state that you are hereby given instructions to make a statement before the Honble Supreme Court that the State of Maharashtra will take necessary steps to make legislative amendment to Section 3.1 of the Maharashtra Act No. XVII of 1986 (The Maharashtra High Court)	Arguments of Respondent
(Hearing of Writ Petitions by Division Bench and Abolition of Letters Patent Appeal) Act, 1986) to make a provision for appeal against the judgment, order and decree passed on the appointed date by the High Court and thereafter as may be indicated in the judgment of the Supreme Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Mohan Parasaran, Additional Solicitor General, urged that being conscious of importance of the institutions of the Supreme Court and the High Courts the Constitution did not confer any power on the State Legislature to legislate or tinker with their jurisdiction therefore, law passed by the State Legislature concerning the jurisdiction of the High Courts having wider ramifications affecting or taking away other jurisdictions already vested in the High Courts would be ultra vires of the State Legislature the powers in this regard lie only with the Parliament the expression administration of justice has to be so construed so as to exclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts from its purview.	Arguments of Respondent
Dr. N.M. Ghatate, learned senior counsel for the State of Madhaya Pradesh (Appellant in C.A. No. 12221224/85) made additional submissions supporting the constitutional validity of the Adhiniyam.	Arguments of Respondent
He contended that the view taken by the Bombay High Court in upholding the constitution validity of the 1987 Act is correct.	Arguments of Respondent
Provisions of the 1986 Act being similar to the Adhiniyam, constitutional validity of the Adhiniyam may be upheld and the Full Bench judgment of the High Court may be reversed.	Arguments of Respondent

In 1948, the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court was taken away and vested in the Sessions Court.	None
The Bombay High Court was having original pecuniary jurisdiction above Rs.	None
50,000/ till 1987 Act came into force.	None
The High Court will continue to have even after implementation of 1987 Act the original jurisdiction in Admiralty, Testamentary, Insolvency and Company jurisdiction apart from its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution.	None
In the State of Maharashtra as far as lower judiciary is concerned, the original civil jurisdiction is vested in (a) Civil Judge, Junior Division and (b) Civil Judge, Senior Division.	None
Civil Judges, Senior Division, are appointed for almost all the towns and the cities in Maharashtra State excluding Greater Bombay.	None
They have unlimited jurisdiction.	None
The Civil Judges, Junior Division, have got pecuniary jurisdiction upto Rs.	None

The District Courts are having appellate jurisdiction upto Rs.	None
50,000/ and beyond Rs. 50,000/, an appeal is provided to the High Court.	None
Civil Judges, Senior Division, in cites like Thane, Pune, Nagpur, Nasik, Aurangabad etc. are having unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction.	None
Only the city civil court which has been established for Greater Bombay was having limited jurisdiction upto Rs.	None
50,000/ and under the 1987 Act, the disparity has been removed by conferring unlimited jurisdiction on city civil court like its counterparts in other cities and towns.	None
Similarly, the jurisdiction of the Small Causes Court is enhanced from Rs. 10,000/ to Rs.	None
25,000/ like Civil Judge, Junior Division in other cities.	None
1987 Act is prospective.	None
Therefore, all the suits filed prior to the implementation of it shall continue to remain with High Court.	None
By the Maharashtra Act 46 of 1977, the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court was raised to Rs.	None
50,000/ in value arising within Greater Bombay.	None
By 1987 Act, Section 3 of the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948 was amended deleting the words not exceeding Rs.	None
50,000/ in value.	None
As a result of the same, the City Civil Court could exercise unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction.	None
Although 1987 Act was passed in 1987, the State Government did not issue notification to enforce it till August 20, 1991 appointing the 1st May, 1992 to be the date on which the provisions of the 1987 Act shall come into force.	Facts
By virtue of the said notification, all suits and other proceedings of civil nature arising within the Greater Bombay subject to exceptions contained in Section 3 were required to be filed in the City Civil Court at Bombay.	None
This resulted in the position that suits and other civil proceedings of civil nature filed in the High Court under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent would not be received and tried on the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the High Court.	None
In the Transferred Cases (C) 811/89, constitutional validity of 1986 Act i.e. Maharashtra High Court (Hearing of Writ Petitions by Division Bench and Abolition of Letters Patent Appeals) Act, 1986 was challenged as being beyond the competence of the State Legislature and also violative of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.	None
In the Statement of Objects and Reasons to this Act, it is clearly stated that the Act is on the lines of Madhya Pradesh Uchaha Nayalaya (Letters Patent Appeals Samapti) Adhiniyam, 1981.	None
Under clause 15, except in certain cases specified in the said clause, appeals lie from judgment of a Single Judge to a Division Bench of the High Court.	None
By the Notification dated 27th May, 1987, 1st July, 1987 was notified as appointed day from which the 1986 Act would come into force.	None
1986 Act was enacted considering it expedient to provide for hearing of writ petitions by Division Bench and for abolition of Letters Patent Appeals in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.	None
Section 3 of the 1986 Act reads 3.	None
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Letters Patent for the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, dated the 28th December, 1865 and in any other instrument having the force of law or in any other law for the time being in force, no appeal, arising from a suit or other proceeding (including the applications referred to in Section 2) instituted or commenced, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, shall lie to the High Court from a judgment, decree or order of a single Judge of the High Court made on or after the commencement of this Act, whether in the exercise of the original or appellate jurisdiction of the High Court.(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1), all such appeals pending before the High Court, on the date immediately preceding the date of commencement of this Act, shall be continued and disposed of by that Court, as if this Act had not been passed.	None
By virtue of the Section 3, appeals from orders of Single Judge to Division Bench from original or appellate jurisdiction were abolished.	None
In this regard, the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioners were that the provisions of the Act are arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution provisions contained in 1986 Act are beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature that a right of appeal is a substantive right and one appeal on facts of law is a necessary ingredient of a system of justice one appeal is provided in various State or Central enactments in case even one appeal is not provided, it would result in serious consequences leading to unreasonable denial of justice.	None
Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents urged that right of appeal is not a substantive right merely because appeal is not provided, an enactment otherwise having legislative competence cannot be rendered invalid right of appeal is a statutory right which may or may not be provided by a statute.	None
In other words, it is not a constitutional right.	None
Para 4 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons of 1987 Act reads After having sufficient experience of the working of the various Courts in the State and having regard to the increase in the value of property, and in the trading and commercial activities, in all urban areas, Government considers that the administration of justice in Greater Bombay as well as in the mofussil should now follow a uniform pattern.	None
There appears no reason why every litigant in Greater Bombay, whose suit or other proceeding is above a certain pecuniary limit, should be made to go to the High Court in the first instance.	None
The High Court, as in most other States in India, should ordinarily be a Court of Appeal and the time of its highly paid and specialized judges should not be consumed in hearing original cases, some of which may be of a small value compared with the enormous increase in the value of property or may be of an unimportant nature.	None
In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of 1986 Act, inter alia, it is stated thus 2.	None
The second part is really in the nature of an exception to the first, inasmuch as it provides, by way of relaxation, appeals under the above clause even in cases of Second Appeals, provided the Judge concerned declares or certifies that the case is fit one for appeal.	None
The appeal provided by way of exception in the second part of the clause has now been barred by section 100A inserted in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, by Central Act 104 of 1976 and there is as such no further right of appeal against the decision of a single Judge in Second Appeal with certificate of fitness.	None
But in view of mounting arrears in the High Court, to discourage further litigation in the same Court and to give finality to the decision of the High Court, even though given by a single Judge, it is necessary to abolish appeals in the same Court from judgments or orders of a single Judge, whether exercising original or appellate jurisdiction, on the lines of the Madhya Pradesh Uchcha Nyayalaya (Letters Patent Appeals) Sampati)	None
Adhiniyam, 1981 (M.P. XXIX of 1981) enacted in Madhya Pradesh.	None
In relation to Entry in List I relating to constitution and organization of Supreme Court and High Courts, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in the Constitutional Debate stated thus I do not wish to interrupt the debate, but I would like to point out that we have already passed Articles 295A, 193, 197, 201 and 207 which deal with the constitution of the High Courts.	None
Under those articles, except or pecuniary jurisdiction, the whole of the High Courts are placed, so far as their constitution, organization and territorial jurisdiction are concerned, in the Centre.	None
It seems to me, therefore, that this amendment is out of order.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
In considering the legislative competence of Maharashtra State in enacting the 1987 Act and 1986 Act primarily we have to look to the relevant entries in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
ListI  Union List Constitution, organization, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court (including contempt of such court), and the fees taken therein persons entitled to practice before the Supreme Court.78.	None
Constitution and Organization (including vacations) of the High Courts except provisions as to officers and servants of High Courts persons entitled to practice before the High Courts.79.	None
Extension of the jurisdiction of a High Court to, and exclusion of the jurisdiction of a High Court from, any union territory.	None
Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List admiralty jurisdiction.	None
List II  State List Administration of justice, Constitution and organization of all courts, except the Supreme Court and High Courts (prior to 3.1.1977).65.	None
Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in this list.	None
(List IIIConcurrent List) 11A. Administration of justice constitution and organization of all courts, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts.13.	None
Civil Procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure at the commencement of this Constitution, limitation and arbitration.46.	None
Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List.	None
As is clear from the Entries extracted above, Entry 77 in List I deals with the constitution, organization, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court.	Reasoning
Entry 78 relates to only constitution and organization of the High Courts and not with the jurisdiction and powers of the High Courts unlike in Entry 77 dealing with the jurisdiction and powers of Supreme Court in addition to constitution and organization.	Reasoning
Jurisdiction and powers of High Court are dealt with as a separate topic under Entry 11A of List III, which was in Entry 3 of List II prior to 42nd Constitution Amendment Act.	Reasoning
The general jurisdiction of the High Courts falls in administration of justice, i.e. under Entry 11A in the Concurrent List.	Reasoning
Entry 95 of the Union List, Entry 65 of the State List and Entry 46 of the Concurrent List refer to special jurisdictions of the courts relating to the matters contained in the respective lists.	Reasoning
Entry 95 deals with the power of Parliament to confer jurisdiction and powers of all the courts except the Supreme Court with respect to any of the matters in List I.	Reasoning
Similarly, Entry 65 of the List II deals with the power of State Legislature to confer jurisdiction and powers on all the courts except the Supreme Court with respect to the matters contained in the said list.	Reasoning
Entry 46 in the Concurrent List refers to the power and jurisdiction of all the courts except the Supreme Court with respect to all the matters contained in the Concurrent List.	Reasoning
It may be noted here that one of the items in the Concurrent List is Civil Procedure under Entry 13.	None
In our view, the State Legislature has power to confer general jurisdiction on all the courts except the Supreme Court under Entry 11A in the Concurrent List falling within the meaning of administration of justice.	None
Hence, the 1987 Act is within the competence of the State Legislature in the light of the discussion and reasons to follow.	Reasoning
The State Legislature was the sole repository of power to confer jurisdiction on all the courts except the Supreme Court and High Court under Entry 3 of the State List prior to Fortysecond Amendment) of 1976 and thereafter the Parliament as well as the State Legislatures have power to confer general jurisdiction on all the courts including the High Courts under Entry 11A of the Concurrent List.	Reasoning
Entry 46 of the Concurrent List deals with the special jurisdiction in respect of the matters in the Concurrent List.	Reasoning
One of the matters in the Concurrent List is the Civil Procedure Code.	Reasoning
The combined reading of the Entry 11A, Entry 13 and Entry 46 of the Concurrent List makes the position clear that the 1987 Act is not beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature when it deals with pecuniary jurisdiction of civil courts.	Reasoning
From careful reading of Entries 77 and 78 of the Union List it is clear that Entry 77 not only deals with the constitution and organization but also with jurisdiction and powers in respect of Supreme Court falling within the exclusive domain of the Parliament.	Reasoning
Entry 11A in the Concurrent List deals with the administration of justice in all the courts and the constitution and organization of all courts, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts.	Reasoning
Thus, it is clear that the Parliament is the sole repository of powers as far as the constitution, organisation, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court is concerned.	Reasoning
Conscious omissions of the words jurisdiction and powers in Entry 78, looking to the said words included in Entry 77, it is clear that the jurisdiction and power of the High Courts are dealt with as a separate topic under the caption administration of justice under Entry 11A of the Concurrent List.	Reasoning
The exclusion of jurisdiction and powers from Entry 78 appears to be meaningful and intended to serve a definite purpose in relation to bifurcation or division of legislative powers relating to conferment of general jurisdiction of High Courts.	Reasoning
Entries 77 and 78 of the Union List deal with constitution and organization of the Supreme Court and the High Courts because after coming into force of the Constitution, the Supreme Court was required to be set up and so also the High Courts were required to be established and or reconstituted.	Reasoning
The expressions constitution and organization of the High Courts in Entry 78 are referable to Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Article 2 empowers the Parliament to admit into the Union or establish new States, Article 3 deals with the formation of new States and alterations of areas, boundaries or names of the existing States and Article 4 provides that laws made under Articles 2 and 3 may provide for amendment of the First and Fourth Schedules and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters.	Reasoning
The words constitution and organisation have their own meaning as against expressions jurisdiction and powers, but in the scheme of the Constitution the subject constitution and organisation of Supreme Court and High Courts rests with the Union.	Reasoning
The general jurisdiction of the High Courts is dealt with in Entry 11A under caption administration of justice, which has a wide meaning and includes administration of civil as well as criminal justice.	Reasoning
The expression administration of justice has been used without any qualification or limitation wide enough to include the powers and jurisdiction of all the courts except the Supreme Court.	Reasoning
The semicolon () after the words administration of justice in Entry 11A has significance and meaning.	Reasoning
The other words in the same Entry after administration of justice only speak in relation to constitution and organisation of all the courts except the Supreme Court and High Courts.	Reasoning
It follows that under Entry 11A State Legislature has no power to constitute and organize Supreme Court and High Courts.	Reasoning
It is an accepted principle of construction of a constitution that everything necessary for the exercise of powers is included in the grant of power.	Reasoning
The State Legislature being an appropriate body to legislate in respect of administration of justice and to invest all courts within the State including the High Court with general jurisdiction and powers in all matters, civil and criminal, it must follow that it can invest the High Court with such general jurisdiction and powers including the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction and also to take away such jurisdiction and powers from the High Court except those, which are specifically conferred under the Constitution on the High Courts.	Reasoning
It is not possible to say that investing the city civil court with unlimited jurisdiction taking away the same from the High Court amounts to dealing with constitution and organisation of the High Court.	Reasoning
Under Entry 11A of List III the State Legislature is empowered to constitute and organize city civil court and while constituting such court the State Legislature is also empowered to confer jurisdiction and powers upon such courts inasmuch as administration of justice of all the courts including the High Court is covered by Entry 11A of List III, so long as Parliament does not enact law in that regard under Entry 11A. Entry 46 of the Concurrent List speaks of the special jurisdiction in respect of the matters in List III.	Reasoning
Entry 13 in List III is Code of Civil Procedure at the commencement of the Constitution From Entry 13 it follows that in respect of the matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure and generally in the matter of civil procedure the Parliament or the State Legislature, as provided by Article 246(2) of the Constitution, acquire the concurrent legislative competence.	Reasoning
The 1987 Act deals with pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts as envisaged in the Code of Civil Procedure and as such the State Legislature was competent to legislate under Entry 13 of List III for enacting 1987 Act.	Reasoning
This view gets support from the various decisions in which entries in Lists I, II and III are interpreted touching the question as to the legislative competence of a State.	None
The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the words constitution and organisation of the High Courts used in Entry 78 of List I are wide enough to take within its ambit, not only the constitution and organization, but, also the general jurisdiction of the High Courts.	Arguments of Petitioner
In contrast, it is contended that Entry 95 in List I pertains to the legislative power of Parliament to invest special jurisdiction in all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I. Correspondingly, Entry 46 of the Concurrent List vests power in Parliament as well as the State legislature to confer special jurisdiction and powers on all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in List III.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similarly, Entry 65 of List II enables the State legislature to confer jurisdiction and powers on all courts, except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in List II.	Arguments of Petitioner
Strong reliance is placed on certain observations of this Court in State of Bombay vs. Narothamdas Jethabhai and another (supra), which dealt with the interpretation of Entries 1 2 of List II (Provincial List) of the Government of India Act, 1935.	None
Entry 1 of List II read the administration of justice constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court Entry 2 of List II read Jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List	None
The contention urged before this Court was that the words administration of justice and constitution and organization of courts occurring in Entry 1 of the Provincial List should be read as exclusive of any matter relating to jurisdiction of courts.	None
Rejecting the arguments, the Court observed It is to be noted that the right to set up courts and to provide for the whole machinery of administration of justice has been given exclusively to the Provincial Legislature.	None
Under Section 101 of the North America Act, the Parliament of Canada has a reserve of power to create additional courts for better administration of the laws of Canada but the Indian Constitution Act of 1935 does not give any such power to the Central Legislature.	None
Courts are to be established by the Provincial Legislature alone.	None
The word court certainly means a place where justice is judicially administered.	None
The appointment of Judges and officers or the mere setting apart of a place where the Judges are to meet, are not sufficient to constitute a court.	None
A court cannot administer justice unless it is vested with jurisdiction to decide cases and the constitution of a court necessarily includes its jurisdiction.	None
(Vide Clements Canadian Constitution, 3rd Edn., p.527).	None
(Per Mukherjea, J.).	None
It was also observed Entry 1 of List II of the Government of India Act, 1935 uses the expressions administration of justice and constitution of all courts in a perfectly general manner.	None
No particular subject is specified to which the administration of justice might relate or for which a court might be constituted.	None
It can, therefore, be legitimately interpreted to a general jurisdiction to decide case not limited to any particular subject The distinction between general and particular jurisdiction has always been recognized in the legislative practice of this country prior to the passing of the Constitution Act of 1935 and also after that.	None
(Per Mukherjea, J.)	None
It was also observed that the contents of general jurisdiction are always indeterminate and are not susceptible of any specific enumeration.	None
The words administration of justice and constitution and organization of courts occurring in entry 1 of the Provincial List were construed in a restricted sense so as to exclude the scope of jurisdiction and powers of courts dealt with specifically in entry 2.	None
(Per Patanjali Sastri, J.).	None
Taking notice of the fact that on the date when the Government of India Act, 1935 was passed, there were in existence in the different Provinces a large number of courts of law and the administration of justice throughout the Provinces was in the hands of these provincial courts, that the civil courts in the Province used to try all suits and proceedings of a civil nature which were triable under the Civil Procedure Code, and the criminal courts used to try all criminal cases triable under the Code of Criminal Procedure, it was pointed out that the jurisdiction and power of the courts were not confined to cases in regard to the subjects stated in List II, nor were they debarred from dealing with cases relating to matters which had been assigned to List I.	None
The jurisdiction of the courts depended in civil cases on a cause of action giving rise to a civil liability, and in criminal cases on the provisions made in the Code of Criminal Procedure as to the venue of the trial and other relevant matters.	None
Fazal Ali, J. observed It seems to me that the Government of India Act, 1935, did not contemplate any drastic change in the existing system of administration of justice, but what it contemplated was that system should continue subject to future legislation by the proper Legislature, Central or Provincial, barring the jurisdiction of courts or conferring jurisdiction or power on special courts with regard to the matters included in the appropriate Legislative Lists, should there be any occasion for such special legislation.	None
He further observedin my opinion, there is nothing in the Act of 1935 to show that there was any intention on the part of its framers to affect the machinery so drastically as to confine it to the administration of a mere partial or truncated kind of justice relating only to matters specified in List II.	None
The learned counsel for the appellant, however, attempts to distinguish this judgment by pointing out that when the Government of India Act, 1935 was passed, the scheme of distribution of legislative powers relating to the constitution and organization of the High Courts was exclusively left with the Provincial Legislature.	None
The Provincial Legislature was fully empowered to make laws relating to the constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court (vide Entry 1 of the Provincial List)	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of this position, the Bombay Provincial Legislature was held to have legislative competence to enact the Bombay City Civil Court Act of 1948 which incidentally trenched upon the jurisdiction of the High Court, and it was essentially an exercise of power within the competence of the Provincial Legislature relatable to Entry 1 of List II of the Government of India Act, 1935.	None
It is not possible to accept that Narothamdas Jethabai (supra) lays down that the words constitution and organization of courts necessarily mean, throughout the Constitution, a situation where the appropriate legislature which is empowered to constitute and organize a court is necessarily invested with general jurisdiction, as contended.	None
The judgment of the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in Amarendra Nath Roy Chowdhury vs. Bikash Chandra Ghose and another (AIR (44) 1957 Calcutta 534), on which reliance was placed before this Court, has put the matter in proper perspective.	None
This was also a case where the petitioner before the High Court of Calcutta challenged the validity of the City Civil Court Act, being West Bengal Act XXI of 1953, on the ground of legislative competence.	None
It was urged before the court that, while under the Government of India Act, 1935, the constitution and organization of a High Court as also its powers were Provincial subjects, under the Constitution these subjects were expressly taken away from the legislative competence of the State Legislature and were made Union subjects.	None
Thus, it was contended that the State Legislature had no competence to make any law touching upon the constitution and organization of the high court, which necessarily included the general jurisdiction of the high court.	None
The judgment of this Court in Narothamdas Jethabai (supra) was also cited by the petitioner.	None
After carefully considering the observations of all the learned Judges who comprised the Bench in Narothamdas Jethabai, and after considering the speech made by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on the floor of the Constituent Assembly, the learned Single Judge summarized the resultant legal position thus, in our opinion correctly, in Paragraph 24 In my opinion the present position may be summarized as follows(1)	None
The constitution and organization, jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court, are Union subjects,(2) While jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court have been expressly included in Entry 77 of List I, these words have been deliberately left out in Entry 78 of the same List, in respect of the High Courts.	None
This omission is not supplied by Entry 95 because that Entry only enables jurisdiction and powers to be given in respect of the matters enumerated in List I. To speak of jurisdiction and powers of the High Courts in respect of constitution and organization of the High Courts would be meaningless.(3)	None
If nothing else was to be found relating to the subject, in any other part of the Constitution, then it might have been necessary to imply that it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to include the concept of jurisdiction and powers within the phrase constitution and organisation of the High Courts in Entry 78.	None
In that event, the result would be that if a High Court was constituted or organized by a Parliamentary Statute, it would automatically be vested with general jurisdiction to administer justice.(4)	None
This construction, however, is not permissible because it is in conflict with Entry 3 in List II or Entry 3 read with Entry 65.	None
It is only the State Legislature that can vest a High Court with general jurisdiction to administer justice.(5) While it is controversial as to whether Entry 78 in List I includes jurisdiction and powers of the High Court, it is clear that under Entry 3 of List II or Entry 3 read with Entry 65, administration of justice is a State subject and the jurisdiction and powers of all Courts in the State including the High Court in respect of administration of justice, which must include general jurisdiction, is a State subject.(6)	None
This construction does give rise to a curious result, namely, that Parliament is given under Entry 78 a power to set up a High Court but not to vest it with jurisdiction excepting in a limited way under Entry 95.	None
Ordinarily, and in so far as legislative practice is concerned, this state of things should not happen, but it has in fact happened under our Constitution.(7)	None
But the evil effects inherent in such an unusual provision in the Constitution is mitigated by the fact that (a) for the most part, the constitution and organisation of the High Courts have already been provided for in the body of the Constitution, and (b) in the case of the formation of new States or organization of existing States, there is ample power under Art. 4 of the Constitution to clothe Parliament with the power to invest High Courts with the necessary jurisdiction and powers of every description.(8) the State Legislature being the appropriate body to legislate in respect of administration of justice and to invest all Courts within the State including the High Court, with general jurisdiction and powers in all matters civil and criminal, it must follow that it can invest a High Court with general jurisdiction and powers (including territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction) and also take away such jurisdiction and powers from the High Court.(9) So far as the Calcutta City Civil Court is concerned, there can be no question that the State Legislature is competent to constitute such a Court and vest it with general jurisdiction, since that comes specifically and plainly within the scope of Entry No.3 or Entry No.3 read with Entry 65 in List II.	Reasoning
The question is as to whether it can at the same time take away any part of the jurisdiction and powers of the High Court.(10)	None
It has been urged that the setting up of the City Civil Court, with a specified jurisdiction, and the taking away of the same jurisdiction from the High Court, was nothing more or less than doing something which affected the constitution and organisation of the High Court.	None
This again depends on the answer to the question as to whether the words constitution and organization necessarily include the concept of jurisdiction and powers meaning thereby, general jurisdiction and powers relating to the administration of justice.	None
So far as these words are used in Entry 78 of List, I, the answer must clearly be in the negative.	None
The constitution and organization of High Courts has been made a Central subject in this limited sense because(a) It was necessary to have uniformity in the organization of all High Courts and this could only be effected by Parliament.(b)	None
The Constitution provides for extension of the jurisdiction of a High Court beyond the State where it has its principal seat and also for a common High Court in two States or two States and a Union Territory.	None
This can only be effected by Parliament.	None
But beyond this, no necessarily was felt of granting to Parliament the power to invest High Courts with general jurisdiction for the administration of justice, which was a provincial subject before and continues to be a State subject.(11)	None
It follows that the taking away of some of the general jurisdiction and powers of the High Court and vesting the same in the City Civil Court would not necessarily mean that the State Legislature was doing anything which could be said to be an infringement of Entry 78 in List I.	None
It was doing what it had power to do under Entry 3, or under Entry 3 read with Entry 65 of List.	None
II.	None
Our attention was drawn by the learned counsel for the appellant to Page 774 of the Constituent Assembly Debates and also to some other parts of the speech made by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Shri Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar during the debates in the Constituent Assembly, when Entry 52 of the Draft Constitution was being debated upon.	None
He drew our attention to the passage the only matter that is left to the the Provincial Legislatures is to fix jurisdiction of the High Courts in a pecuniary way or with regard to the subject matter.	None
The rest of the High Court is placed, within the jurisdiction of the Centre.	None
Obviously when considering entries in the Union List which are meant to give complete power to the Centre, we were bound to make good this lacuna and to bring in the High Courts which, as I said, by virtue of these article excepting for two cases have been completely placed within the purview of the Parliament.	None
In our view, the portion of the speech of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar on the floor of the Constituent Assembly referred to on Page 543 of the Calcutta High Courts judgment is more appropriate one which, in effect, throws light on the issue.	None
Thus, the only purpose of the amendment was to bring uniformity as far as the constitution and organization of the High Courts in the different States were concerned.	None
Particularly taking notice of the fact that the High Courts in different Provinces had been functioning for several years and there was no consistency in their established practices, it was proposed to bring all the High Courts in the States under the jurisdiction of Parliament so that there was some uniformity in the organization of the different High Courts in India.	None
As the judgment of the Calcutta High Court correctly points out, Entry 3 (prior to 3.1.1977) (or Entry 11A after 3.1.1977) read with Entry 65 of List II (administration of justice) is a State subject and the jurisdiction and powers of all courts in the State, including the High Courts, in respect of administration of justice, which must include general jurisdiction is a State subject.	None
It is true that the Calcutta High Court noticed the curious result that followed from the Constitutional entries as were available at the material time.	None
It noticed that while under Entry 78 of List I, Parliament was given power to set up the High Courts, but did not have power to invest them with general jurisdiction, but had power to invest them with special jurisdiction under Entry 95 of List I.	None
The State Legislature would have the jurisdiction to invest the High Courts, set up by Parliament, with the necessary general jurisdiction under Entry 3 (at the material time) of List II (Administration of Justice) both Parliament and the State legislature also had the competence to make laws to invest the High Courts with special jurisdiction under Entry 65 of List III.	Reasoning
Perhaps, the situation then was somewhat anomalous and led to the curious result noticed by the High Court of Calcutta at the material time.	None
However, Entry 3 of List II was amended by the Constitution (42nd Amendment Act of 1976) with effect from 3.1.1977.	None
The words administration of justice constitution and organization of all courts except the Supreme Court and the High Courts were removed from Entry 3 and inserted as Entry 11 A in the Concurrent List.	None
Consequently, on and after 3.1.1977 both Parliament and State Legislature are competent to legislate with respect to the subject administration of justice which would be wide enough to invest the High Court constituted and reorganised by Parliament with the general jurisdiction.	None
We have already notice the power of both the Parliament and State Legislature to legislate within their respective spheres so as to invest the High Court with special jurisdiction.	None
Thus, on and after 3.1.1977 the situation appears to be as under Parliament alone has the competence to legislate with respect to Entry 78 of List I to constitute and organize the High Courtb) Both Parliament and State Legislature can invest such a High Court with general jurisdiction by enacting an appropriate legislation referable to administration of justice under Entry 11A of List III.c)	None
Parliament may under Entry 95 of List I invest the High Court with jurisdiction and powers with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I.d) State Legislature may invest the High Court with the jurisdiction and powers with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List IIe) Both Parliament and State Legislature may be appropriate legislation referable to Entry 46 of List III invest the High Court with jurisdiction and powers with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III.	Reasoning
In this view of the matter, we are unable to accept the contention that Parliament alone has the exclusive competence to invest the High Court with the general jurisdiction referable to constitution and organization of the High Court.	Reasoning
It is true that there are several provisions in Articles 216, 217, 221, 222, 223, and 224 wherein the President of India and the Government of India alone have been given powers, in the matters stated therein.	Reasoning
This by itself does not militate against the view that we are inclined to take.	Reasoning
The observations in State of Maharashtra vs. Kusum Charudutt Bharma Upadhye, 83 Bombay LR 75 (Para 7) were pressed in service in support.	None
All that the Bombay High Court said is under the Constitution, Parliament has by ordinary law the power to constitute and organize, that is, to create, new High Courts as also to enlarge or abridge the jurisdiction of all High Courts, including the High Courts which were in existence at the commencement of the Constitution.	None
These observations were made in connection with the questions before the Special Bench of the Bombay High Court, whether an appeal would lie under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent from the judgment of a single Judge of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution in a petition filed on the Original Side or the Appellate Side of the High Court and, whether such an appeal would lie from the judgment of a Single Judge of the High Court in a petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and also, whether an appeal would lie from an interlocutory order made by a single Judge of the High Court appointing a receiver in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.	None
The Bombay High Court did not express its view the Parliament alone had such powers, nor about the meaning to be given to the expression administration of justice, which is now placed in the Concurrent List on and after 3.1.1977.	None
The contention, therefore, cannot be accepted.	None
Reference was made to the judgment of the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court in Geetika Panwar vs. Government of NCT of Delhi Ors. 99	None
(2002)	None
DLT 840.	None
The learned counsel contended that the submissions of the learned Attorney General made before the Delhi High Court, as noticed in this judgment, were indicative of the stand of the Government of India in the matter.	None
Placing reliance on the doctrine of contemporanea expositio the learned counsel urged that the constitutional interpretation as understood by the executive should be accepted by us.	None
We are afraid, when it comes to interpretation of the Constitution, it is not permissible to place reliance on contemporanea exposition to the extent urged.	None
Interpretation of the Constitution is the sole prerogative of the Constitutional Courts and the stand taken by the executive in a particular case cannot determine the true interpretation of the Constitution.	None
The learned counsel urged that, as a result of judgment of the full Bench of the Delhi High Court in Geetika Panwar case (supra) and striking down of Delhi High Court Amendment Act 2001 as ultra vires the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi, Parliament stepped in by enacting Delhi High Court (Amendment) Act, 2003.	None
According to the learned counsel this was also indicative of the fact that the Parliament had recognized and accepted the construction put on the constitutional provisions in Geetika Panwar as correct and responded by a curative legislation.	None
The fact the Parliament responded to the situation by enacting Delhi High Court Amendment Act, 2003 also cannot by itself show that the view taken by the High Court of Delhi in Geetika Panwar was correct.	None
It is possible that the executive might have taken the shorter course of amending the legislation instead of challenging the view taken by the Delhi High Court before this Court.	None
The reference of Section 30 of the Andhra Act, 1953 or to the provisions of Section 49 of the State Reorganisation Act, 1956 is of no avail.	None
The investment of power in such cases, where a High Court is set up in a reorganized State, is referable to Article 4 of the Constitution, which is an independent power not referable to Entry 78 of List I. In O.N. Mohindroo vs. The Bar Council of Delhi Ors. 1968 (2) SCR 709 after analyzing Entries 77, 78, and 95 of List I, Entry 65 of List II and Entry 46 of List III, this Court observed The scheme for conferring jurisdiction and powers on courts is (a) to avoid duplication of Courts.	None
Federal and State Courts as in the Constitution of the United States, (b) to enable Parliament and the State Legislatures to confer jurisdiction on courts in respect of matters in their respective lists except in the case of the Supreme Court where the legislative authority to confer jurisdiction and powers is exclusively vested in Parliament.	None
In the case of the Concurrent List both the legislatures can confer jurisdiction and powers on courts except of course the Supreme Court depending upon whether the Act is enacted by one or the other.	None
Entry 3 in List II confers legislative powers on the States in the matter of Administration of Justice constitution and organization of all courts, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts officers and servants of the High Courts procedure in rent and revenue courts fees taken in all courts except the Supreme Court.	None
It is clear that except for the constitution and the organization of the Supreme Court and the High Courts the legislative power in the matter of administration of justice has been vested in the State Legislatures.	None
The State Legislatures can, therefore enact laws, providing for the constitution and organization of courts except the Supreme Court and the High Courts, and confer jurisdiction and powers on them in all matters, civil and criminal, except the admiralty jurisdiction.	None
It would, of course, be open to Parliament to bar the jurisdiction of any such court by special enactment in matters provided in Lists I and III where it has made a law but so long as that is not done the courts established by the State Legislatures would have jurisdiction to try all suits and proceedings relating even to matters in Lists I and III.	None
Thus, so far as the constitution and organization of the Supreme Court and the High Courts are concerned, the power is with Parliament.	None
As regards the other courts, Entry 3 of List II confers such a power on the State Legislatures.	None
As regards jurisdiction and powers, it is Parliament which can deal with the jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court and the admiralty jurisdiction.	None
Parliament can confer jurisdiction and powers on all courts in matters set out in List I and List III where it has passed any laws.	None
But under the power given to it under entry 3 in List II, a State Legislature can confer jurisdiction and powers on any of the courts except the Supreme Court in respect of any statute whether enacted by it or by Parliament except where a Central Act dealing with matters in Lists I and III otherwise provides.	None
That these entries contemplate such a scheme was brought out in State of Bombay vs. Narothamdas, where it was contended that the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 40 of 1948, constituting the said Civil Court as an additional court was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature as it conferred jurisdiction on the new court not only in respect of matters in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935 but also in regard to matters in List I such as promissory notes in item 8 of List I. Rejecting the contention it was held that the impugned Act was a law with respect to a matter enumerated in List II and was not ultra vires as the power of the Provincial Legislature to make laws with respect to administration of justice and constitution and organization of all courts under item 1 of List II was wide enough to include the power to make laws with regard to the jurisdiction of courts established by the Provincial Legislature that the object of item 53 of List I, item 2 List II and item 15 of List III was to confer such powers on the Central and the Provincial Legislatures to make laws relating to the jurisdiction of courts with respect to the particular matters that are referred to in List I and II respectively and the Concurrent List, and that these provisions did not in any way curtail the power of the Provincial Legislature under item 1 of List II to make laws with regard to jurisdiction of courts and to confer jurisdiction on courts established by it to try all causes of a civil nature subject to the power of the Central and Provincial Legislatures to make special provisions relating to particular subjects referred to in the Lists.	None
It may be mentioned that item 53 in List I, items 1 and 2 in List II and item 15 in List III in the Seventh Schedule to the 1935 Act more or less correspond to entries 77, 78 and 95 in List I, entries 3 and 65 in List II and entry 46 in List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.	None
The constitutional validity of the City Civil Court Act of Calcutta being West Bengal Act No.XXI of 1953 which had received the assent of the President under which the pecuniary jurisdiction was conferred on the city civil court above Rs.5,000/ but not exceeding Rs.10,000/ was challenged on various grounds similar to the grounds raised challenging the validity of the 1987 Act.

The Division Bench upheld the validity of the Act including the amendments.	None
The matter reached this Court with a contention that the Parliament alone had legislative competence to make the law affecting the original side jurisdiction of the High Court and, therefore, the State Legislature had no power to pass any law dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court.	None

3 SCC 682 dealing with the aforementioned contention, after setting out Entries 77, 78 and 95 in List I, Entries 3 (new Entry No. 11A in the Concurrent List) and Entry 65 in List II and Entry 46 in List III, and reiterating the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Narothamdas (supra), observed that this decision (Narothamdas) of the Constitution Bench clearly negatives the claim of the appellant that the impugned Act was ultra vires the jurisdiction of the West Bengal Legislature.	None
Admittedly, the Act received Presidential assent and was, therefore, competent to bring about a change in the prevailing position obtaining under the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court.	None
In the same judgment, this Court further observed thus A similar challenge as in the present dispute had also been raised before the Calcutta High Court in the case of Amarendra Nath Roy Chowdhary vs. Bikash Chandra Ghosh AIR 1957 Cal. 535 and a learned Single Judge relying on the decision of Constitution Bench referred to above had held that the Act was intra vires the State Legislature.	None
We are of the view that the decision of the Constitution Bench is a clear and binding precedent against the appellants stand.	None
(emphasis supplied) Having observed thus, this Court approved the aforementioned judgment in Amarendra Nath Roy Chowdhary (supra).	None
This Court in Narothamdas and Indu Bhushan De (supra) clearly laid down that power of legislature to confer or take away general jurisdiction of all courts excepting the Supreme Court is a separate topic and forms part of the administration of justice and not part of constitution and organisation of High Courts.	Reasoning
In first round in Mulchand Kundanmal Jagtiani vs. Raman Hiralal Singh AIR (36) 1949 Bombay 197 the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the validity of the 1948 Act.	None
Thereafter, on 20.1.1950, the Provincial Government issued a notification conferring on the city civil court jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of civil nature not exceeding Rs.25,000/ in value arising within Greater Bombay.	None
In Narothamdas vs. A.P. Phillips AIR 1951 Bom. 180 , the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court declared the said notification as invalid on the ground that notification amounted to delegation of legislative function.	None
In the appeal filed by the State, this Court reversed the judgment of the Bombay High Court in State of Bombay vs. Narothamdas 1951 SCR 51 holding that Section 4 of 1948 Act did not amount to delegation of legislative power and that the notification dated 20.1.1951 was intra vires.	None
The respondents had challenged the validity of the 1948 Act before this Court on the ground that the Act was ultra vires the Provisional Legislature by reason of encroachment upon the field of legislation reserved for Centre under List I of Seventh Schedule of the Govt.	None

Madras High Court in Ahmed Moideen Khan Ors.	None
vs. Inspector of D Division AIR 1959 Madras 261 dealt with challenge to the Act No. XXXIV of 1955 under which the State Legislature divested criminal jurisdiction of Madras High Court and vested it in the sessions court.	None
There also challenge was no the ground that the Act was not within the competence of State Legislature inasmuch as it amounted to reconstitution or reorganisation of the High Court within the meaning of Entry 78 of List I.	None
The Division Bench, overruling all the contentions, held that the State Legislature was competent to enact the Act No. XXXIV of 1955 under Entry 3 of List II (administration of justice).	None
The Division Bench also stated that the State Legislature has power to pass legislation under Entries 1, 2 and 46 of List III i.e. (i) criminal law including matters included in Indian Penal Code (ii) Criminal Procedure Code and Entry 46 of List III which confers power on the State to legislate in respect of the subjects contained in the Concurrent List.	None

In IndoMercantile Bank Ltd vs. Commissioner, Quilon Municipality AIR 1961 Kerala 96, the Kerala High Court held that the State Legislature was fully competent to pass the Act by virtue of its powers under Articles 225, 146(3) read with Seventh Schedule List II Entry 3 of the Constitution.	None
A Division Bench of the Mysore High Court in Shivarudrappa Girimallappa Saboji Anr.	None
vs. Kapurchand Meghaji Marwadi Ors.	None
AIR 1965 Mysore 76 held that Sections 19 and 29(2)(c) of the Mysore Civil Court Act, 1964 were constitutionally valid as the same were within the competence of the State Legislature under Entry 3 of List II i.e. Administration of Justice observing thus If the core of Administration of justice is the exercise of judicial power which is also understood as the exercise of jurisdiction any legislation on the exercise of such judicial power or jurisdiction is legislation on administration of justice and is therefore, what is authorized by the 3rd Entry of the said List.	None
If Legislation on administration of justice in the High Court is as already explained also within the field of that Entry then Article 246(3) of the Constitution empowers the State Legislature to make Legislation on that subject, just as Parliament has powers within the field of the 77 Entry of the Union list to make legislation among other matters on the jurisdiction and power of the Supreme Court.	Reasoning
It is of course plain that that legislative power which the State Legislature may exercise under clause (3) of Article 246 of the Constitution is subject to clauses (1) and (2) of the said Article and also two other provisions of the Constitution as stated in Article 245(1).	None
It is for the Legislature of the State of define the frontier of the powers or jurisdiction exercisable by its High Court.	None
In the same judgment, the High Court in regard to Entry 78 of List I, went on to say that the subject relating to constitution and organization of High Courts is not a subject relating to jurisdiction and powers of the High Court but subject which has reference only to the establishment or the constitution of the High Court while the third Entry of the State List is what authorizes legislation on such jurisdiction and powers.	None
A Full Bench of the Punjab Haryana High Court in Rajinder Singh etc. vs. Kultar Singh Ors.	None
AIR 1980 PH I touching the same topic stated thus So far as the High Courts are concerned, the topics of jurisdiction and powers in general is not separately mentioned in any of the Entries of the List	None
I but administration of justice as a distinct topic finds place in Entry 3 of List II (Now Entry 11A of the List III).The expression administration of justice occurring in Entry 3 of List II of the VIIth Schedule has to be construed in its widest sense so as to give power to the State Legislature to legislate on all the matters relating to administration of justice.	None
After the words administration of justice in Entry 3 there is a semi colon and this punctuation cannot be discarded as being inappropriate.	None
The punctuation has been put with a definite object of making this topic as distinct and not having relation only to the topic that follows thereafter.	None
Under Entry 78 of List I, the topic of jurisdiction and powers of the High Courts, is not deal with.	None
Under Entry 3 of List II the State Legislature can confer jurisdiction and power or restrict or withdraw jurisdiction and powers already conferred on any courts except the Supreme Court in respect of any statute.	None
Therefore, the State legislature has the power to make law with respect to jurisdiction and powers of the High Court.	None
In Aswini Kumar Ghosh Anr.	None
vs. Arabinda Bose Anr.	None
AIR 1952 SC 369 , Mukhkerjea J. in para 57 has observed that Punctuation is after all a minor element in the construction of a statute and very little attention is paid to it by English Courts.	None
When a statute is carefully punctuated and there is doubt about its meaning, a weight should undoubtedly be given to the punctuation.	None
In our view Full Bench of Punjab Haryana High Court was right in giving emphasis and meaning to semi colon in Entry 3 of the List after the words administration of justice in Rajinder Singh (supra).	None
Semi colon after the words administration of justice in Entry 11A, in our view, has significance in dealing with the topic whether administration of justice includes conferring general jurisdiction on High Court in addition to the subordinate courts within the State.	None
A Division Bench of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh in K. Kumarswamy Kumandan Bros. vs. Premier Electric C. AIR 1959 AP 3 has proceeded on similar lines observing thus The words administration of justice, constitution and organization of courts have been used in Entry 3 of List II without any qualification or limitation and they imply the power and jurisdiction of Courts.	None
The jurisdiction to entertain suits and to dispose of them is certainly the branch of administration of justice.	None
So it must necessarily include the power to entertain the suits or proceedings of a civil or criminal nature irrespective of the value of the subject matter.	None
This power necessarily implies the authority to enhance, alter, amend or diminish the jurisdiction of courts territorially and pecuniarily.	None
In the light of the various decisions referred to above, the position is clear that the expression Administration of Justice has wide amplitude covering conferment of general jurisdiction on all courts including High Court except the Supreme Court under Entry 11A of List III.	None
It may be also noticed that some of the decisions rendered dealing with Entry 3 of List II prior to 3.1.1977 touching Administration of Justice support the view that conferment of general jurisdiction is covered under the topic Administration of Justice.	None
After 3.1.1977 a part of Entry namely Administration of Justice is shifted to List III under Entry 11A.	None
This only shows that topic Administration of Justice can now be legislated both by the Union as well as the State Legislatures.	None
As long as there is no Union Legislation touching the same topic, and there is no inconsistency between the Central legislation and State legislation on this topic, it cannot be said that State Legislature had no competence to pass 1987 Act and 1986 Act.	None
It may be added that the State Legislature was also competent to enact the 1987 Act under Entry 13 read with Entry 46 of List III.	Reasoning
Entry 13 of List III relates to Civil Procedure Code.	Reasoning
The jurisdiction of civil court, particularly pecuniary jurisdiction of civil courts, was specially covered by the Civil Procedure Code on the date of commencement of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Entry 46 of List III relates to jurisdiction and power of all courts except the Supreme Court i.e. including the city civil court and High Court with respect to any matter in List III including Civil Procedure Code in Entry 13.	Reasoning
The contention that merely constituting and organizing High Courts without conferring jurisdiction to deal with the matters on them does not serve any purpose, cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
The Constitution itself has conferred jurisdiction on High Courts, for instance, under Articles 226 and 227.	Reasoning
This apart, under various enactments both the Central and State, certain jurisdiction is conferred on High Courts.	Reasoning
The High Courts have power and jurisdiction to deal with such matters as are conferred by the Constitution and other statutes.	Reasoning
This power of Administration of Justice has been included in the Concurrent List after 3.1.1977 possibly to enable both Centre as well as States to confer jurisdiction on High Courts under various enactments passed by the Centre or the State to meet the needs of the respective States in relation to specific subjects.	Reasoning
Thus, viewed from any angle, it is not possible to agree that the 1987 Act and 1986 Act are beyond the competence of the State Legislature.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, of the view that there is no merit in the contention that the State Legislature did not have competence to enact the two legislations, the constitutionality of which has been challenged before us.	Reasoning
Two other subsidiary contentions urged on behalf of the appellant in Civil Appeal No.2452/92 are required to be examined  (i) in the absence of necessary infrastructure and the requisite number of judges in the city civil court, the action of the State Government in issuing notification dated 20.8.1991 was arbitrary and unreasonable and (ii) the said notification was issued unfairly due to pressure on account of agitation by a section of lawyers and for other extraneous consideration.	None
Before the High Court, it was contended that the impugned Act was brought into force by the notification exercising statutory power unreasonably and arbitrarily in violation of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution there was no infrastructure in the city civil court to cope with the additional burden of new civil suits and other proceedings of civil nature which would be filed on or after 1.5.1992.	None
In that regard, deficiencies were pointed out as to the court rooms, required number of Judges and other infrastructure by giving details.	None
In opposition, it was contended that in implementing the Act, there were bound to be some inevitable problems having regard to the magnitude of required infrastructure, court rooms and required number of Judges etc.	None
such problems were inevitable they can be worked out in due course of time but, on that ground itself, the impugned notification need not be struck down.	None
The High Court, after consideration opined that the State Government had taken somewhat hasty step without application of mind to implement the impugned Act without providing infrastructure and without meeting other requirements in relation to appointment of judges as recommended by the High Court.	None
The High Court further observed thus The High Court exercises judicial and administrative control over the subordinate courts in the State of Maharashtra.	None
It would be a matter of concern for the High Court to see that the litigants in Courts do not suffer hardship due to want of adequate infrastructure.	None
Under the constitutional scheme, the High Court has to perform its vital role and duties in respect of the administration of justice and, therefore, if infrastructure is not provided till this date, result would certainly be violation of fundamental rights of the litigants under Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.	None
We may usefully refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in All India Judges Association vs. Union of India AIR 1992 SC 165 in which the Supreme Court has referred to the duty of the State to provide infrastructure which includes residential accommodation to the judicial officers in the subordinate judiciary.	None
The said judgment refers to this aspect as duty cast upon the State Government to give suitable residential accommodation to the Judges.	None
Dealing with the contention that a writ could not be issued to the Government to bring or not to bring the law into force, relying on the decision in A.K. Roy vs. Union of India AIR 1982 SC 710 , the High Court noticed the facts in that case.	Reasoning
That was a case in which one of the questions considered with regard to Central Government issuing a notification for bringing the provisions of Section 3 of the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978 into force.	Reasoning
This Court on the facts of the case observed, The Parliament having left to the unfettered judgment of the Central Government the question as regards the time for bringing the provisions of the 44th Amendment into force, it is not for the Court to compel the Government to do that which according to the mandate of the Parliament lies in its discretion to do when it considers it opportune to do it.	Reasoning
There, the writ of mandamus was sought to the Central Government to issue a notification to bring into force the provisions of Section 3 of the 44th Amendment Act.	Reasoning
In the case on hand the position is entirely different.	Reasoning
Here is a case pursuant to statutory provisions the State Government has acted and issued the Notification dated 20th August, 1991 for implementation of the provisions of the 1987 Act.	Reasoning
The decision in the case of R.K. Porwal vs. State of Maharashtra AIR 1981 SC 1127 was cited before the High Court in support of the impugned notification to contend that it was not permissible for the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to decide as to whether sufficient and adequate reasons existed for bringing the law into operation.	None
That was a case which related to shifting of market of agricultural produce from Greater Bombay to New Bombay.	None
It was in that context this Court observed that since adequate facilities were provided at New Bombay, no interference was called for.	None
Para 15 of the said judgment reads It was also said that neither the Gultakdi market not the Turbhe Market had any convenience or facility or was ready for use on the date on which it was notified as the Principal Market for the concerned market area.	None
On the material placed before us we are satisfied that all reasonable conveniences and facilities are now available in both the markets, whatever might have been the situation on the respective dates of notification.	None
We refrain from embarking into an enquiry as to the situation obtaining on the dates of notification.	None
We do say that a place ought not to be notified as a market unless it is ready for use as a market with all reasonable facilities and conveniences but we do not conceive it to be our duty to pursue the matter to the extreme limit of quashing the notification when we find that all reasonable facilities and conveniences are now available.	None
While a notification may be quashed if nothing has been done beyond publishing the notification, in cases where some facilities and conveniences have been provided but not some others which are necessary, the Court may instead of quashing the notification give appropriate timebound directions for providing necessary facilities and conveniences.	None
On the facts of the present case, we are satisfied that all reasonable facilities and conveniences are now provided.	None
We are also satisfied that the traders have been making one desperate attempt after another to avoid moving into the new markets and they have been successful in stalling the notification from becoming effective for quite a number of years.	None
(Emphasis supplied)	None
It is clear from para 15 extracted above that if the facilities were not to be provided at New Bombay then the Court could have certainly interfered with	None
and they would have passed appropriate orders as demanded by the situation.	None
Further, in the same paragraph, it is clearly stated that in cases where some facilities and conveniences have been provided, but not some others, which are necessary, the court may, instead of quashing the notification, give appropriate timebound directions for providing necessary facilities and conveniences.	None
The High Court on facts in the present case found inadequacy in infrastructure and shortcomings in meeting the requirement as to court rooms and number of Judges to deal with the transfer of jurisdiction to city civil court.	None
In this regard, the High Court in paras 44 and 45 has stated thus Mr. Singhvi submitted that the above observations clearly indicate that it is not permissible for the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution to decide as to whether sufficient and adequate reasons existed for bringing the law into operation.	None
In that case, issue was with regard to shifting of market of agricultural produce from Greater Bombay to New Bombay.	None
It was in this context that the Supreme Court observed that since adequate facilities were provided at New Bombay, no interference was called for.	None
However, in para 15 of the judgment, the Supreme Court has made it clear that if the said facilities were not to be provided at New Bombay, then the Court could have certainly interfered with and they would have passed appropriate orders as demanded by the situation.	None
This passage has been relied upon heavily by Mr. Andhyarujina to content that even in matters of conditional legislation, this Court can give appropriate directions if facts before the Court clearly indicate that adequate infrastructure has not been provided.45.	None
In the present case, we are not dealing with only case of traders but also the State Governments decision to implement the impugned Act by the impugned notification in which the High Court also has to play an important role.	None
As mentioned hereinabove, we are dealing with the topic of administration of justice.	None
The High Court exercises judicial and administrative control over subordinate Courts in the State of Maharashtra and having regard to the interest of the litigants in the city of Bombay and having regard to the fact that there is already an institution which is working for the last 125 years, it would not be appropriate to rush through the implementation of the impugned Act without providing adequate infrastructure.	None
It cannot be overlooked that from 1987 till this day, the State Government has not implemented the impugned Act and one of the reasons for nonimplementation appears to us that the State Government was unable to provide the infrastructure including appointment of new Judges as per the recommendation of the High Court.	None
Having regard to the peculiar circumstances which are existing in Bombay, in our opinion, it would not be in the interest of administration of justice as also in the interest of litigants or the institution to rush through in such a haste and implement the impugned Act by impugned notification dated 20th August, 1991 from 1st May, 1992.	None
Looking to what is found by the High Court on facts in relation to infrastructure, and keeping in view the position of law as stated in the judgments of this Court aforementioned, we have no good reason to take a different view.	None
In other words, in this regard we concur with the view expressed by the High Court in deferring the implementation of the impugned Notification to a future date and giving liberty to the State Government to apply.	None
The High Court deferred to implementation of the impugned Notification till 2.10.1992.	None
This Court on 23.9.1992 passed the following order an affidavit has been filed on behalf of the State Government to show the infrastructural facilities for the new courts intended to deal with fresh cases.	None
In certain essential aspects, facilities are in the form of proposals for action.	None
The appointment of the requisite minimum number of judicial officers is also said to be under process.	None
Admittedly, there are no extant facilities for the functional operation of even the sixteen new courts proposed by the State Government.	None
The question of implementation of the amendments would arise only after these infrastructural facilities are completed.	None
After bringing into existence the requisite infrastructure, the State Government is at liberty to file an affidavit indicating that all the requirements have been made available and that at least sixteen courts have become functional with the appointment and posting of Presiding Officers, arrangements of court halls posting of the court staff etc.	None
The affidavit may be filed within six weeks from today.	None
Liberty to mention.2.	None
The 2nd October, 1992 fixed by the High Court for commencement of the operation of the amended provisions is in the circumstances extended till 30th November, 1992.Printing of the records is dispensed with.	None
Additional documents, if any, may be filed by both sides within four weeks from today.	None
Written submissions from both sides to be filed before 30th November, 1992.	None
Subject to appellants filing their written submissions before 30th November 1992, the matter shall be listed for final hearing on the 9th, 10th and 11th December, 1992 to be heard on daytoday basis.	None
It is expected that the appellants would complete the submissions on their side in one and half days and the respondents in one day and reply in the remaining half a day.	None
The schedule of hearing shall be within this timeframe and the arguments to be completed within three days so limited.	None
Again on 27.11.1992, this Court passed the order which reads From the report of the High Court and the omission on the part of the State to place on affidavit the requisite infrastructure to be provided, we gather that things are not very different from where we left matters on the last occasion.	None
The matters will now be listed for final hearing on 27th, 28th and 29th January, 1993.Stay to continue till further orders.	None
The State shall in the meanwhile expedite arrangements for providing requisite infrastructure and report to Court on affidavit.	None
The said order is operating till now i.e. for more than 12 years.	None
During this period, what steps have been taken by the State Government, what is the existing situation, and whether all the requirements are satisfied before liberty can be given to the State Government to implement the impugned notification, are the matters to be ascertained.	None
In this view, the implementation of the impugned Notification is to be deferred.	None
It is open to the State Government to apply to this Court seeking permission for implementation of the said Notification placing on record necessary material to show that there is adequacy of infrastructure and the requirements as to number of judges and court rooms etc. are satisfied.	None
In this regard a report from the High Court is also required to be called as and when the State Government applies to this Court seeking permission for implementation of the said notification dated 20th August, 1991.	None
As indicated in paragraph 18 of this judgment, it is open to the State of Maharashtra to take necessary steps to amend Section 3 of the 1986 Act for providing an appeal.	Reasoning
Merely because an appeal is not provided in any statute, that by itself does not render a statute constitutionally invalid.	Reasoning
It is well settled that the right of appeal is to be provided by a statute.	Reasoning
In other words, right of appeal is statutory and not a constitutional right.	Reasoning
This apart, if a statute does not provide an appeal in respect of certain matter, the party still will have remedy in approaching the High Court or this Court, as the case may be, in exercise of power of judicial review including under Article 136 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Moreover the difficulty in the case only relates to a class of cases as indicated in paragraph 18 of this judgment to such decrees, which may be passed after the commencement of the 1987 Act and 1986 Act in any suit or other proceedings pending in the High Court since before the commencement of the said Acts.	Reasoning
This apart, as stated in paragraph 18, the State of Maharashtra is willing to take steps to provide an appeal by amending Section 3 of the 1986 Act.	Reasoning
As regards the other contention that the Notification has been issued due to pressure brought about by a section of lawyers and for extraneous considerations, it may be stated that no particulars were given and no material was placed on record before the High Court and even before us except repeating this ground.	Reasoning
We do not find any good ground to accept this contention advanced on behalf of the appellant.	Reasoning
Hence, it is rejected.	Reasoning
The argument that the 1986 Act or Adhiniyam encroaches upon the legislative power of Parliament, cannot be accepted, in the view we have taken that it was competent for the State Legislatures to pass law relating to general jurisdiction of the High Courts dealing with the topic administration of justice under Entry 11A of List III.	Reasoning
Assuming that incidentally 1986 Act and the Adhiniyam touch upon the Letters Patent, the 1986 Act and Adhiniyam cannot be declared either as unconstitutional or invalid applying doctrine of pith and substance having due regard to the discussion already made above while dealing with the legislative competence of the State in passing the 1987 Act.	Reasoning
Para 35 in Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee Ors.	None
vs. Bank of Commerce Ltd., Khulna AIR (34) 1947 PC 60 reads thus Moreover, the British Parliament when enacting the Indian Constitution Act had a long experience of the working of the British North America Act and the Australian Commonwealth Act and must have known that it is not in practice possible to ensure that the powers entrusted to the several legislatures will never overlap.	None
As Sir Maurice Gwyer C.J. said in 1940 F.C.R. 188 (supra) at.	None
201It must inevitably happen from time to time that legislation though purporting to deal with a subject in one list, touches also upon a subject in another list, and the different provisions of the enactment may be so closely interwined that blind adherence to a strictly verbal interpretation would result in a large number of statutes being declared invalid because the Legislature enacting them may appear to have legislated in a forebidden sphere.	None
Hence, the rule which has been evolved by the Judicial Committee, whereby the impugned statute is examined to ascertain its pith and substance or its true nature and character for the purpose of determining whether it is legislation with respect to matters in this list or in that.90.	None
In para 37 of the same judgment, it is stated that Subjects must still overlap and where they do, the question must be asked what in pith and substance is the effect of the enactment of which complaint is made and in what list is its true nature and character to be found.	None
If these questions could not be asked, much beneficent legislation would be stifled at birth, and many of the subjects entrusted to Provincial Legislation could never effectively be dealt with This Court yet in another judgment in Bharat Hydro Power Corpn.	None

Ors.	None
vs. State of Assam Anr.	None
(2004) 2 SCC 553 , touching the same question, in para 18 has observed thus It is likely to happen from time to time that enactment though purporting to deal with a subject in one list touches also on a subject in another list and prima facie looks as if one legislature is impinging on the legislative field of another legislature.	None
This may result in a large number of statutes being declared unconstitutional because the legislature enacting law may appear to have legislated in a field reserved for the other legislature.	None
To examine whether a legislation has impinged on the field of other legislatures, in fact or in substance, or is incidental, keeping in view the true nature of the enactment, the courts have evolved the doctrine of pith and substance for the purpose of determining whether it is legislation with respect to matters in one list or the other.	None
Where the question for determination is whether a particular law relates to a particular subject mentioned in one list or the other, the courts look into the substance of the enactment.	None
Thus, if the substance of the enactment falls within the Union List then the incidental encroachment by the enactment on the State List would not make it invalid.	None
This principle came to be established by the Privy Council when it determined appeals from Canada or Australia involving the question of legislative competence of the federation or the States in those countries.	None
This doctrine came to be established in India and derives its genesis from the approach adopted by the courts including the Privy Council in dealing with controversies arising in other federations.	None
For applying the principle of pith and substance regard is to be had (i) to the enactment as a whole, (ii) to its main objects, and (iii) to the scope and effect of its provisions.	None
For this see Southern Pharmaceuticals Chemicals vs. State of Kerala (1981) 4 SCC 391 , State of Rajasthan vs. G. Chawla AIR 1959 SC 544 , Thakur Amar Singhi vs. State of Rajasthan AIR 1955 SC 504 , Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. vs. Union of India (1983) 4 SCC 166 and Vijay Kumar Sharma vs. State of Karnataka (1990) 2 SCC 562.	None
In the lastmentioned case it was held (SCC p. 576, para 15) 15.	None
(3) Where a law passed by the State Legislature while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provision of the Act it appears that by an large the law falls within the four corners of the State List and entrenchment, if any, is purely incidental or inconsequential.	None
A Constitution Bench of this Court in Association of Natural Gas Ors.	None
vs. Union of India Ors.	None
(2004) 4 SCC 489 has observed that Entries in the List are themselves not powers of legislation, but fields of legislation.	None
An Entry in one List cannot be interpreted so as to annul or obliterate another Entry or make another Entry meaningless and that in case of apparent conflict or any Entry overlapping the other, every attempt shall be made to harmonise the same.	None
Para 15 of the judgment reads Although Parliament cannot legislate on any of the entries in the State List, it may do so incidentally while essentially dealing with the subject coming within the purview of the entry in the Union List.	None
Conversely, the State Legislature also while making legislation may incidentally trench upon the subject covered in the Union List.	None
Such incidental encroachment in either event need not make the legislation ultra vires the Constitution.	None
The doctrine of pith and substance is sometimes invoked to find out the nature and content of the legislation.	None
However, when there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two legislations, the Central legislation shall prevail.	None
However, every attempt would be made to reconcile the conflict.	None
In view of the discussion made and reasons recorded above, we uphold the constitutional validity of 1987 Act, 1986 Act and the Adhiniyam.	Decision
The Notification dated 20.8.1991 issued by the State of Maharashtra shall not be implemented without further orders from this Court in the light of what is stated in para 85.	Decision
In the result, Civil Appeal No.2452 of 1992 is dismissed subject to above observations as to the implementation of the impugned notifications.	None
Civil Appeal Nos. 2529 of 1992 and 2530 of 1992 are dismissed in terms of this judgment.	Decision
Transfer Case (C) Nos.811/89 (i.e. Writ Petition Nos 1953/87 and 1960, 1974 2054/87) are dismissed.	Decision
Civil Appeal Nos. 12221224 of 1985 are allowed, the impugned judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh is set aside and the writ petitions stand dismissed.	Decision
No costs.	None
