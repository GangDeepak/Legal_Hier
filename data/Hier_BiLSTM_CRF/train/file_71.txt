Section 434 of the Companies Act, 2013 reads as follows Transfer of certain pending proceedings(1)	None
On such date as may be notified by the Central Government in this behalf, (a) all matters, proceedings or cases pending before the Board of Company Law Administration (herein in this section referred to as the Company Law Board) constituted under subsection (1) of section 10E of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), immediately before such date shall stand transferred to the Tribunal and the Tribunal shall dispose of such matters, proceedings or cases in accordance with the provisions of this Act (b) any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Company Law Board made before such date may file an appeal to the High Court within sixty days from the date of communication of the decision or order of the Company Law Board to him on any question of law arising out of such order Provided that the High Court may if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing an appeal within the said period, allow it to be filed within a further period not exceeding sixty days and (c) all proceedings under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), including proceedings relating to arbitration, compromise, arrangements and reconstruction and winding up of companies, pending immediately before such date before any District Court or High Court, shall stand transferred to the Tribunal and the Tribunal may proceed to deal with such proceedings from the stage before their transfer Provided that only such proceedings relating to the winding up of companies shall be transferred to the Tribunal that are at a stage as may be prescribed by the Central Government.	Facts
Provided further that any party or parties to any proceedings relating to the winding up of companies pending before any Court immediately before the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018, may file an application for transfer of such proceedings and the Court may by order transfer such proceedings to the Tribunal and the proceedings so transferred shall be dealt with by the Tribunal as an application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.	Facts
This court has already in CP 152/2016 vide decision dated 27.9.2018 in Rajni Anand vs. Cosmic Structures Limited held that the power under section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 for transfer of a petition to NCLT is discretionary and has to be exercised in the facts and circumstances of the case so as to expeditiously deal with the proceedings winding up.	Facts
In my opinion, it would be in the interest of justice and in the interest of the respondent company and the creditors that the matter be transferred to NCLT in exercise of the discretionary powers of the court under section 434 of the Companies Act, 1956.	Facts
The order appointing the OL is a recent order and not much time has elapsed since then.	Facts
The OL has only taken steps to seize the office of the respondent company and the factory premises and further exercise is yet to be carried out.	Facts

It is from this order that the appellant companys appeal to the Division Bench has been dismissed by the impugned order in which the learned Division Bench held as follows The process under IBC is meant to find the best possible solution in a given case, which is beneficial to the company concerned as well as its creditors and other stakeholders.	None
Therefore, in the interest of equity and justice, and keeping in mind the special nature of the IBC, if the Learned Company Judge has found it fit to transfer the winding up petition to NCLT on the application of respondent No. SBI who is a secured creditor, this Court would not ordinarily interfere with the judgment of the Learned Company Judge, and that too, on the asking of the erstwhile management.	Facts
The Learned Company Judge rightly recalled the order of appointment of Official Liquidator and admission of petition, since the liquidation was at its initial stage and the learned Company Judge was fully competent to do so.	Facts
After the passing of the winding up order, the OL had not proceeded to take any effective or irreversible steps towards liquidation of the assets of the appellant company.	Facts
All that he appears to have done is to take possession and control of the registered office of the appellant company and its factory premises and its records and books.	Facts
Pertinently, the respondent No. 2 has already initiated proceedings before the NCLT in respect of the appellant company which, in any event, would continue.	Facts
The continuation of the liquidation proceedings at the hands of the OL in terms of the order passed by this Court would be incongruous with the proceedings that the NCLT has undertaken and would undertake under the IBC.	Facts
Continuation of two parallel proceedings one before the Company Court for liquidation, and the other before the IBC for resolution revival, would serve no useful purpose.	Facts
The statutory scheme found in Section 434(1)(c) clearly is that the proceedings for winding up pending before the Company Court could be transferred to the NCLT and there is no provision for transfer of proceedings from the NCLT to the Company Court.	Facts
We, thus uphold the impugned order passed by the Ld. Company Judge in C.A. No. 1240/2018, dated 14.01.2019 and dismiss the appeal.	Facts
Shri Sidharth Luthra, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant company, referred to three judgments of this Court, namely, Jaipur Metals Electricals Employees Organization v. Jaipur Metals Electricals Ltd., (2019) 4 SCC 227 Jaipur Metals, Forech India Ltd. v. Edelweiss Assets Reconstruction Co. Ltd., 2019 SCCOnLine SC 87 Forech, and M s Kaledonia Jute Fibres Pvt	Arguments of Petitioner
. Ltd. v. M s Axis Nirman Industries Ltd.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ors., 2020 SCCOnLine SC 943 Kaledonia.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, none of the judgments apply to the facts of the present case inasmuch as, on the facts in the present case, once a winding up order has been passed by the Company Judge, winding up proceedings alone must continue before the High Court and parallel proceedings under the Code cannot continue.	Arguments of Petitioner
He argued that Jaipur Metals (supra) makes it clear that even independent proceedings under the Code can only continue when the stage is before a winding up order is passed, which was the case on the facts before the Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Likewise, in Forech (supra) also, the stage of the winding up proceeding was post service of notice of the winding up petition and before a winding up order was passed, as a result of which the 5th proviso to section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 was applied.	Arguments of Petitioner
Likewise, in Kaledonia (supra), though a winding up order had been passed on the facts of that case, the aforesaid order had been kept in abeyance.	Arguments of Petitioner
On facts therefore, these three cases are entirely distinguishable and would have no application to a scenario in which a winding up order has been passed and the Official Liquidator has in fact seized the assets of the company in order to begin the process of distribution to creditors and others which would ultimately result in dissolution of the company.	Arguments of Petitioner
4.	None
Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India appearing on behalf of SBI, countered all these submissions.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, this Court has unequivocally laid down that the 5 th proviso to section 434(1)(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 now makes it clear that a discretion is vested in the Company Court to transfer winding up proceedings to the NCLT without reference to the stage of winding up.	Arguments of Respondent
Even post admission, according to the learned Attorney General, if no irreversible steps have been taken, then a combined reading of the 5th proviso to section 434(1)(c) and section 238 of the Code would lead to the result that the winding up proceeding be transferred to the NCLT, as not only is the Code a special enactment with a nonobstante clause which would, in cases of conflict, do away with the Companies Act, 2013, but also that, given the judgment of this Court in Swiss Ribbons Pvt.	Arguments of Respondent
Ltd. Anr.	Arguments of Respondent
v. Union of India Ors., (2019) 4 SCC 17 Swiss Ribbons, winding up is a last resort after all efforts to revive a company fail.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, the discretion exercised by the Company Court and the Division Bench has been judiciously and correctly exercised, warranting no interference at our hands.	Arguments of Respondent
In Swiss Ribbons (supra), this Court had occasion to deal with the raison dtre for the enactment of the Code.	Reasoning
The judgment of this Court referred to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Code as follows The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Code have been referred to in Innoventive Industries Innoventive Industries Ltd. v. ICICI Bank, (2018) 1 SCC 407 (2018) 1 SCC (Civ) 356 which states (SCC pp. 42122, para 12)	Reasoning
The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Code reads as under Statement of Objects and Reasons.	None
There is no single law in India that deals with insolvency and bankruptcy.	Reasoning
Provisions relating to insolvency and bankruptcy for companies can be found in the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and the Companies Act, 2013.	Reasoning
These statutes provide for creation of multiple fora such as Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and their respective Appellate Tribunals.	Reasoning
Liquidation of companies is handled by the High Courts.	Reasoning
Individual bankruptcy and insolvency is dealt with under the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909, and the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 and is dealt with by the courts.	Reasoning
The existing framework for insolvency and bankruptcy is inadequate, ineffective and results in undue delays in resolution, therefore, the proposed legislation.	None
The objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2015 is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a timebound manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and balance the interests of all the stakeholders including alteration in the priority of payment of government dues and to establish an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Fund, and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.	Reasoning
An effective legal framework for timely resolution of insolvency and bankruptcy would support development of credit markets and encourage entrepreneurship.	Reasoning
It would also improve Ease of Doing Business, and facilitate more investments leading to higher economic growth and development.	Reasoning
The Code seeks to provide for designating NCLT and DRT as the adjudicating authorities for corporate persons and firms and individuals, respectively, for resolution of insolvency, liquidation and bankruptcy.	Reasoning
The Code separates commercial aspects of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings from judicial aspects.	Reasoning
The Code also seeks to provide for establishment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Board) for regulation of insolvency professionals, insolvency professional agencies and information utilities.	Reasoning
Till the Board is established, the Central Government shall exercise all powers of the Board or designate any financial sector regulator to exercise the powers and functions of the Board.	Reasoning
Insolvency professionals will assist in completion of insolvency resolution, liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings envisaged in the Code.	Reasoning
Information Utilities would collect, collate, authenticate and disseminate financial information to facilitate such proceedings.	Reasoning
The Code also proposes to establish a fund to be called the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Fund of India for the purposes specified in the Code.	Reasoning
The Code seeks to provide for amendments in the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Central Excise Act, 1944, Customs Act, 1962, the Income Tax Act, 1961, the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, the Finance Act, 1994, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003, the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, and the Companies Act, 2013.	Reasoning
The Code seeks to achieve the above objectives.	None
(emphasis in original)	None
The Court then went on to state As is discernible, the Preamble gives an insight into what is sought to be achieved by the Code.	Reasoning
The Code is first and foremost, a Code for reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate debtors.	Reasoning
Unless such reorganisation is effected in a timebound manner, the value of the assets of such persons will deplete.	Reasoning
Therefore, maximisation of value of the assets of such persons so that they are efficiently run as going concerns is another very important objective of the Code.	Reasoning
This, in turn, will promote entrepreneurship as the persons in management of the corporate debtor are removed and replaced by entrepreneurs.	Reasoning
When, therefore, a resolution plan takes off and the corporate debtor is brought back into the economic mainstream, it is able to repay its debts, which, in turn, enhances the viability of credit in the hands of banks and financial institutions.	Reasoning
Above all, ultimately, the interests of all stakeholders are looked after as the corporate debtor itself becomes a beneficiary of the resolution schemeworkers are paid, the creditors in the long run will be repaid in full, and shareholders investors are able to maximise their investment.	Reasoning
Timely resolution of a corporate debtor who is in the red, by an effective legal framework, would go a long way to support the development of credit markets.	Reasoning
Since more investment can be made with funds that have come back into the economy, business then eases up, which leads, overall, to higher economic growth and development of the Indian economy.	Reasoning
What is interesting to note is that the Preamble does not, in any manner, refer to liquidation, which is only availed of as a last resort if there is either no resolution plan or the resolution plans submitted are not up to the mark.	Reasoning
Even in liquidation, the liquidator can sell the business of the corporate debtor as a going concern.	Reasoning
(See ArcelorMittal ArcelorMittal (India) (P) Ltd. v. Satish Kumar Gupta, (2019) 2 SCC 1 at para 83, fn 3).	Reasoning
It can thus be seen that the primary focus of the legislation is to ensure revival and continuation of the corporate debtor by protecting the corporate debtor from its own management and from a corporate death by liquidation.	Reasoning
The Code is thus a beneficial legislation which puts the corporate debtor back on its feet, not being a mere recovery legislation for creditors.	Reasoning
The interests of the corporate debtor have, therefore, been bifurcated and separated from that of its promoters those who are in management.	Reasoning
Thus, the resolution process is not adversarial to the corporate debtor but, in fact, protective of its interests.	Reasoning
The moratorium imposed by Section 14 is in the interest of the corporate debtor itself, thereby preserving the assets of the corporate debtor during the resolution process.	Reasoning
The timelines within which the resolution process is to take place again protects the corporate debtors assets from further dilution, and also protects all its creditors and workers by seeing that the resolution process goes through as fast as possible so that another management can, through its entrepreneurial skills, resuscitate the corporate debtor to achieve all these ends.	Reasoning
Having so held, the Court ended stating Epilogue The Insolvency Code is a legislation which deals with economic matters and, in the larger sense, deals with the economy of the country as a whole.	None
Earlier experiments, as we have seen, in terms of legislations having failed, trial having led to repeated errors, ultimately led to the enactment of the Code.	Reasoning
The experiment contained in the Code, judged by the generality of its provisions and not by socalled crudities and inequities that have been pointed out by the petitioners, passes constitutional muster.	Reasoning
To stay experimentation in things economic is a grave responsibility, and denial of the right to experiment is fraught with serious consequences to the nation.	Reasoning
We have also seen that the working of the Code is being monitored by the Central Government by Expert Committees that have been set up in this behalf.	Reasoning
Amendments have been made in the short period in which the Code has operated, both to the Code itself as well as to subordinate legislation made under it.	Reasoning
This process is an ongoing process which involves all stakeholders, including the petitioners.	Reasoning
We are happy to note that in the working of the Code, the flow of financial resource to the commercial sector in India has increased exponentially as a result of financial debts being repaid.	Reasoning
Approximately 3300 cases have been disposed of by the adjudicating authority based on outofcourt settlements between corporate debtors and creditors which themselves involved claims amounting to over INR 1,20,390 crores.	Reasoning
Eighty cases have since been resolved by resolution plans being accepted.	Reasoning
Of these eighty cases, the liquidation value of sixtythree such cases is INR 29,788.07 crores.	Reasoning
However, the amount realised from the resolution process is in the region of INR 60,000 crores, which is over 202 of the liquidation value.	Reasoning
As a result of this, Reserve Bank of India has come out with figures which reflect these results.	Reasoning
Thus, credit that has been given by banks and financial institutions to the commercial sector (other than food) has jumped up from INR 4952.24 crores in 20162017, to INR 9161.09 crores in 20172018, and to INR 13,195.20 crores for the first six months of 20182019.	Reasoning
Equally, credit flow from nonbanks has gone up from INR 6819.93 crores in 20162017, to INR 4718 crores for the first six months of 20182019.	Reasoning
Ultimately, the total flow of resources to the commercial sector in India, both bank and nonbank, and domestic and foreign (relatable to the nonfood sector) has gone up from a total of INR 14,530.47 crores in 20162017, to INR 18,469.25 crores in 20172018, and to INR 18,798.20 crores in the first six months of 20182019.	Reasoning
These figures show that the experiment conducted in enacting the Code is proving to be largely successful.	Reasoning
The defaulters paradise is lost.	Reasoning
In its place, the economys rightful position has been regained.	Reasoning
The result is that all the petitions will now be disposed of in terms of this judgment.	Reasoning
There will be no order as to costs.	None
Viewed in this backdrop, let us now examine some of the judgments of this Court dealing with transfer of winding up petitions from the Company Court to be tried by the NCLT under the Code.	None
Section 255 of the Code reads as follows Amendments of Act 18 of 2013.The Companies Act, 2013 shall be amended in the manner specified in the Eleventh Schedule.	None
In pursuance of this section, the Eleventh Schedule to the Code made various amendments to the Companies Act, 2013.	None
They have been set out in detail in Jaipur Metals (supra) in paragraphs 10 and 11.	None
Suffice it to say that the first step to transferring winding up proceedings to the NCLT was taken by the Companies (Transfer of Pending Proceedings) Rules, 2016 Transfer Rules, 2016, which compulsorily transferred all winding up proceedings pending before High Courts to the NCLT at a stage prior to the service of the petition in terms of Rule 26 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959.	Facts
By an amendment made on 17.08.2018, the 5 th proviso to section 434(1)(c) was added which states as follows Transfer of certain pending proceedings.(1) On such date as may be notified by the Central Government in this behalf, (a) xxx	None
xxx xxx (b)	None
xxx xxx xxx (c) all proceedings under the Companies Act, 1956, including proceedings relating to arbitration, compromise, arrangements and reconstruction and winding up of companies, pending immediately before such date before any District Court or High Court, shall stand transferred to the Tribunal and the Tribunal may proceed to deal with such proceedings from the stage before their transfer	None
xxx xxx xxx Provided further that any party or parties to any proceedings relating to the winding up of companies pending before any Court immediately before the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance, 2018, may file an application for transfer of such proceedings and the Court may by order transfer such proceedings to the Tribunal and the proceedings so transferred shall be dealt with by the Tribunal as an application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (31 of 2016).	Facts
The Court in Jaipur Metals (supra) was directly concerned with a special category of cases dealt with by Rule 5(2) of the aforesaid Transfer Rules which was omitted later on.	Reasoning
Despite the omission, the Court applied this Rule, read with the amendment made to section 434 of the Companies Act, 2013 on 17.08.2018, stating However, though the language of Rule 5(2) is plain enough, it has been argued before us that Rule 5 was substituted on 2962017, as a result of which, Rule 5(2) has been omitted.	Reasoning
The effect of the omission of Rule 5(2) is not to automatically transfer all cases under Section 20 of the SIC Act to NCLT, as otherwise, a specific rule would have to be framed transferring such cases to NCLT, as has been done in Rule 5(1).	Reasoning
The real reason for omission of Rule 5(2) in the substituted Rule 5 is because it is necessary to state, only once, on the repeal of the SIC Act, that proceedings under Section 20 of the SIC Act shall continue to be dealt with by the High Court.	Reasoning
It was unnecessary to continue Rule 5(2) even after 2962017 as on 15122016, all pending cases under Section 20 of the SIC Act were to continue to be dealt with by the High Court before which such cases were pending.	Reasoning
Since there could be no opinion by the BIFR under Section 20 of the SIC Act after 1122016, when the SIC Act was repealed, it was unnecessary to continue Rule 5(2) as, on 1512 2016, all pending proceedings under Section 20 of the SIC Act were to continue with the High Court and would continue even thereafter.	Reasoning
This is further made clear by the amendment to Section 434(1)(c), with effect from 178 2018, where any party to a windingup proceeding pending before a court immediately before this date may file an application for transfer of such proceedings, and the Court, at that stage, may, by order, transfer such proceedings to NCLT.	Reasoning
The proceedings so transferred would then be dealt with by NCLT as an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process under the Code.	Reasoning
It is thus clear that under the scheme of Section 434 (as amended) and Rule 5 of the 2016 Transfer Rules, all proceedings under Section 20 of the SIC Act pending before the High Court are to continue as such until a party files an application before the High Court for transfer of such proceedings post 1782018.	Reasoning
Once this is done, the High Court must transfer such proceedings to NCLT which will then deal with such proceedings as an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process under the Code.	Reasoning
The High Court judgment, therefore, though incorrect in applying Rule 6 of the 2016 Transfer Rules, can still be supported on this aspect with a reference to Rule 5(2) read with Section 434 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended, with effect from 1782018.	Reasoning
In a significant passage, the Court then went on to hold However, this does not end the matter.	None
It is clear that Respondent 3 has filed a Section 7 application under the Code on 1112018, on which an order has been passed admitting such application by NCLT on 1342018.	Reasoning
This proceeding is an independent proceeding which has nothing to do with the transfer of pending windingup proceedings before the High Court.	Reasoning
It was open for Respondent 3 at any time before a windingup order is passed to apply under Section 7 of the Code.	Reasoning
This is clear from a reading of Section 7 together with Section 238 of the Code which reads as follows Provisions of this Code to override other laws.	None
The provisions of this Code shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law.	Reasoning
The Court therefore finally held We are of the view that NCLT was absolutely correct in applying Section 238 of the Code to an independent proceeding instituted by a secured financial creditor, namely,	Reasoning
the Alchemist Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd.	None
This being the case, it is difficult to comprehend how the High Court could have held that the proceedings before NCLT were without jurisdiction.	Reasoning
On this score, therefore, the High Court judgment has to be set aside.	Reasoning
NCLT proceedings will now continue from the stage at which they have been left off.	Reasoning
Obviously, the company petition pending before the High Court cannot be proceeded with further in view of Section 238 of the Code.	Reasoning
The writ petitions that are pending before the High Court have also to be disposed of in light of the fact that proceedings under the Code must run their entire course.	Reasoning
We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the High Courts judgment Jaipur Metals and Electricals Ltd., In re, 2018 SCC OnLine Raj 1472.	Reasoning
In Forech (supra), this Court, after setting out the aforesaid Rules and the 5th proviso to section 434(1)(c), then held We are of the view that Rules 26 and 27 clearly refer to a preadmission scenario as is clear from a plain reading of Rules 26 and 27, which make it clear that the notice contained in Form No. 6 has to be served in not less than 14 days before the date of hearing.	Reasoning
Hence, the expression was admitted in Form No. 6 only means that notice has been issued in the winding up petition which is then fixed for hearing before the Company Judge on a certain day.	Reasoning
Thus, the Madras High Court view is plainly incorrect whereas the Bombay High Court view is correct in law.	Reasoning
The resultant position in law is that, as a first step, when the Code was enacted, only winding up petitions, where no notice under Rule 26 of the Companies (Court) Rules was served, were to be transferred to the NCLT and treated as petitions under the Code.	Reasoning
However, on a working of the Code, the Government realized that parallel proceedings in the High Courts as well as before the adjudicating authority in the Code would stultify the objective sought to be achieved by the Code, which is to resuscitate the corporate debtors who are in the red.	Reasoning
In accordance with this objective, the Rules kept being amended, until finally Section 434 was itself substituted in 2018, in which a proviso was added by which even in winding up petitions where notice has been served and which are pending in the High Courts, any person could apply for transfer of such petitions to the NCLT under the Code, which would then have to be transferred by the High Court to the adjudicating authority and treated as an insolvency petition under the Code.	Reasoning
This statutory scheme has been referred to, albeit in the context of Section 20 of the SICA, in our judgment which is contained in Jaipur Metals Electricals Employees Organization Through General Secretary Mr. Tej Ram Meena v. Jaipur Metals Electricals Ltd. Through its Managing Director, being a judgment by a Division Bench of this Court dated 12.12.2018.	Reasoning
Resultantly, the Court thereafter held This Section is of limited application and only bars a corporate debtor from initiating a petition under Section 10 of the Code in respect of whom a liquidation order has been made.	Reasoning
From a reading of this Section, it does not follow that until a liquidation order has been made against the corporate debtor, an Insolvency Petition may be filed under Section 7 or Section 9 as the case may be, as has been held by the Appellate Tribunal.	Reasoning
Hence, any reference to Section 11 in the context of the problem before us is wholly irrelevant.	Reasoning
However, we decline to interfere with the ultimate order passed by the Appellate Tribunal because it is clear that the financial creditors application which has been admitted by the Tribunal is clearly an independent proceeding which must be decided in accordance with the provisions of the Code.	Reasoning
Though, we are not interfering with the Appellate Tribunals order dismissing the appeal, we grant liberty to the appellant before us to apply under the proviso to Section 434 of the Companies Act (added in 2018), to transfer the winding up proceeding pending before the High Court of Delhi to the NCLT, which can then be treated as a proceeding under Section 9 of the Code.	Reasoning
In Kaledonia (supra), the question which arose before the Court arose after a winding up order had been passed, but which had been kept in abeyance by the Company Court.	Reasoning
The vexed question before the Court was whether the expression any person could apply for transfer contained in paragraph 17 of the judgment of this Court in Forech (supra) would refer to persons who are not parties to the proceeding.	Reasoning
This Court, after setting out section 278 of the Companies Act, 2013, then held Thus, the proceedings for winding up of a company are actually proceedings in rem to which the entire body of creditors is a party.	Reasoning
The proceeding might have been initiated by one or more creditors, but by a deeming fiction the petition is treated as a joint petition.	Reasoning
The official liquidator acts for and on behalf of the entire body of creditors.	Reasoning
Therefore, the word party appearing in the 5th proviso to Clause (c) of Subsection (1) of section 434 cannot be construed to mean only the single petitioning creditor or the company or the official liquidator.	Reasoning
The words party or parties appearing in the 5th proviso to Clause (c) of Subsection (1) of Section 434 would take within its fold any creditor of the company in liquidation.	Reasoning
The above conclusion can be reached through another method of deductive logic also.	Reasoning
If any creditor is aggrieved by any decision of the official liquidator, he is entitled under the 1956 Act to challenge the same before the Company Court.	Reasoning
Once he does that, he becomes a party to the proceeding, even by the plain language of the section.	Reasoning
Instead of asking a party to adopt such a circuitous route and then take recourse to the 5 th proviso to section 434(1)(c), it would be better to recognise the right of such a party to seek transfer directly.	Reasoning
As observed by this Court in Forech India Limited (supra), the object of IBC will be stultified if parallel proceedings are allowed to go on in different fora.	Reasoning
If the Allahabad High Court is allowed to proceed with the winding up and NCLT is allowed to proceed with an enquiry into the application under Section 7 IBC, the entire object of IBC will be thrown to the winds.	Reasoning
Therefore, we are of the considered view that the petitionerherein will come within the definition of the expression party appearing in the 5th proviso to Clause (c) of Subsection (1) of Section 434 of the Companies Act, 2013 and that the petitioner is entitled to seek a transfer of the pending winding up proceedings against the first respondent, to the NCLT.	Reasoning
It is important to note that the restriction under Rules 5 and 6 of the Companies (Transfer of Pending Proceedings) Rules, 2016 relating to the stage at which a transfer could be ordered, has no application to the case of a transfer covered by the 5th proviso to clause (c) of subsection (1) of Section 434.	Reasoning
Therefore, the impugned order of the High court rejecting the petition for transfer on the basis of Rule 26 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 is flawed.	Reasoning
(emphasis in original)	None
What becomes clear upon a reading of the three judgments of this Court is the following So far as transfer of winding up proceedings is concerned, the Code began tentatively by leaving proceedings relating to winding up of companies to be transferred to NCLT at a stage as may be prescribed by the Central Government.	Reasoning
This was done by the Transfer Rules, 2016 (supra) which came into force with effect from 15.12.2016.	Reasoning
Rules 5 and 6 referred to three types of proceedings.	Reasoning
Only those proceedings which are at the stage of preservice of notice of the winding up petition stand compulsorily transferred to the NCLT.	Reasoning
The result therefore was that post notice and pre admission of winding up petitions, parallel proceedings would continue under both statutes, leading to a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.	Reasoning
This led to the introduction of the 5th proviso to section 434(1)(c) which, as has been correctly pointed out in Kaledonia (supra), is not restricted to any particular stage of a winding up proceeding.	Reasoning
Therefore, what follows as a matter of law is that even post admission of a winding up petition, and after the appointment of a Company Liquidator to take over the assets of a company sought to be wound up, discretion is vested in the Company Court to transfer such petition to the NCLT.	Reasoning
The question that arises before us in this case is how is such discretion to be exercised?	Reasoning
The Companies Act, 2013 deals with winding up of companies in a separate chapter, being Chapter XX.	Reasoning
When a petition to wind up a company is presented before the Tribunal, the Tribunal is given the power under Section 273 to dismiss it to make any interim order as it thinks fit to appoint a provisional liquidator of the company till the making of a winding up order to make an order for the winding up of the company or to pass any other order as it thinks fit see section 273(1).	Reasoning
Sections 278 and 279 of the Companies Act, 2013 then follow, which state Effect of windingup order.	None
The order for the windingup of a company shall operate in favour of all the creditors and all contributories of the company as if it had been made out on the joint petition of creditors and contributories.	None
Stay of suits, etc., on windingup order.(1)	None
When a windingup order has been passed or a provisional liquidator has been appointed, no suit or other legal proceeding shall be commenced, or if pending at the date of the windingup order, shall be proceeded with, by or against the company, except with the leave of the Tribunal and subject to such terms as the Tribunal may impose Provided that any application to the Tribunal seeking leave under this section shall be disposed of by the Tribunal within sixty days.	None
Nothing in subsection (1) shall apply to any proceeding pending in appeal before the Supreme Court or a High Court.	None
Once a winding up order is made, and a Company Liquidator is appointed, such liquidator is then to submit a report to the Tribunal under section 281 as follows Submission of report by Company Liquidator.	None
Where the Tribunal has made a windingup order or appointed a Company Liquidator, such liquidator shall, within sixty days from the order, submit to the Tribunal, a report containing the following particulars, namely (a) the nature and details of the assets of the company including their location and value, stating separately the cash balance in hand and in the bank, if any, and the negotiable securities, if any, held by the company Provided that the valuation of the assets shall be obtained from registered valuers for this purpose (b) amount of capital issued, subscribed and paidup (c) the existing and contingent liabilities of the company including names, addresses and occupations of its creditors, stating separately the amount of secured and unsecured debts, and in the case of secured debts, particulars of the securities given, whether by the company or an officer thereof, their value and the dates on which they were given (d) the debts due to the company and the names, addresses and occupations of the persons from whom they are due and the amount likely to be realised on account thereof (e) guarantees, if any, extended by the company (f) list of contributories and dues, if any, payable by them and details of any unpaid call (g) details of trademarks and intellectual properties, if any, owned by the company (h) details of subsisting contracts, joint ventures and collaborations, if any details of holding and subsidiary companies, if any (j) details of legal cases filed by or against the company and (k) any other information which the Tribunal may direct or the Company Liquidator may consider necessary to include.	None
The Company Liquidator shall include in his report the manner in which the company was promoted or formed and whether in his opinion any fraud has been committed by any person in its promotion or formation or by any officer of the company in relation to the company since the formation thereof and any other matters which, in his opinion, it is desirable to bring to the notice of the Tribunal.	None
The Company Liquidator shall also make a report on the viability of the business of the company or the steps which, in his opinion, are necessary for maximising the value of the assets of the company.	None
The Company Liquidator may also, if he thinks fit, make any further report or reports.	None
Any person describing himself in writing to be a creditor or a contributory of the company shall be entitled by himself or by his agent at all reasonable times to inspect the report submitted in accordance with this section and take copies thereof or extracts therefrom on payment of the prescribed fees.	None
The Tribunal is then to consider the aforesaid report and fix a time limit within which the proceedings shall be completed and the company dissolved, which time limit may be revised see section 282(1).	None
Importantly, the companys properties shall, on the order of the Tribunal, be taken over by the Company Liquidator and be deemed to be in custodia legis see section 283(1) and 283(2).	None
Thereafter, the Tribunal is to settle a list of contributories under section 285.	None
The Company Liquidator is then to make periodical reports to the Tribunal with respect to the progress of the winding up proceedings as follows Submission of periodical reports to Tribunal.	None
(1) The Company Liquidator shall make periodical reports to the Tribunal and in any case make a report at the end of each quarter with respect to the progress of the windingup of the company in such form and manner as may be prescribed.	None
The Tribunal may, on an application by the Company Liquidator, review the orders made by it and make such modifications as it thinks fit.	None
Section 290 is important because it lays down the powers and duties of the Company Liquidator as follows Powers and duties of Company Liquidator.(1)	None
Subject to directions by the Tribunal, if any, in this regard, the Company Liquidator, in a windingup of a company by the Tribunal, shall have the power (a) to carry on the business of the company so far as may be necessary for the beneficial windingup of the company (b) to do all acts and to execute, in the name and on behalf of the company, all deeds, receipts and other documents, and for that purpose, to use, when necessary, the companys seal (c) to sell the immovable and movable property and actionable claims of the company by public auction or private contract, with power to transfer such property to any person or body corporate, or to sell the same in parcels (d) to sell the whole of the undertaking of the company as a going concern (e) to raise any money required on the security of the assets of the company (f) to institute or defend any suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding, civil or criminal, in the name and on behalf of the company (g) to invite and settle claim of creditors, employees or any other claimant and distribute sale proceeds in accordance with priorities established under this Act (h) to inspect the records and returns of the company on the files of the Registrar or any other authority to prove rank and claim in the insolvency of any contributory for any balance against his estate, and to receive dividends in the insolvency, in respect of that balance, as a separate debt due from the insolvent, and rateably with the other separate creditors (j) to draw, accept, make and endorse any negotiable instruments including cheque, bill of exchange, hundi or promissory note in the name and on behalf of the company, with the same effect with respect to the liability of the company as if such instruments had been drawn, accepted, made or endorsed by or on behalf of the company in the course of its business (k) to take out, in his official name, letters of administration to any deceased contributory, and to do in his official name any other act necessary for obtaining payment of any money due from a contributory or his estate which cannot be conveniently done in the name of the company, and in all such cases, the money due shall, for the purpose of enabling the Company Liquidator to take out the letters of administration or recover the money, be deemed to be due to the Company Liquidator himself (l) to obtain any professional assistance from any person or appoint any professional, in discharge of his duties, obligations and responsibilities and for protection of the assets of the company, appoint an agent to do any business which the Company Liquidator is unable to do himself (m) to take all such actions, steps, or to sign, execute and verify any paper, deed, document, application, petition, affidavit, bond or instrument as may be necessary, for windingup of the company for distribution of assets in discharge of his duties and obligations and functions as Company Liquidator and (n) to apply to the Tribunal for such orders or directions as may be necessary for the winding up of the company.	None
The exercise of powers by the Company Liquidator under subsection (1) shall be subject to the overall control of the Tribunal.	None
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), the Company Liquidator shall perform such other duties as the Tribunal may specify in this behalf.	None
Under section 292, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, the Company Liquidator shall, in the administration of the assets of the company and the distribution thereof among its creditors, have regard to any directions which may be given by the resolution of the creditors or contributories at any general meeting see section 292(1).	None
It is only when the affairs of the company have been completely wound up that an application is to be made to the Tribunal to dissolve the company under section 302, which is set out hereinbelow Dissolution of company by Tribunal.(1)	None
When the affairs of a company have been completely wound up, the Company Liquidator shall make an application to the Tribunal for dissolution of such company.	None
The Tribunal shall on an application filed by the Company Liquidator under subsection (1) or when the Tribunal is of the opinion that it is just and reasonable in the circumstances of the case that an order for the dissolution of the company should be made, make an order that the company be dissolved from the date of the order, and the company shall be dissolved accordingly.	None
The Tribunal shall, within a period of thirty days from the date of the order, (a) forward a copy of the order to the Registrar who shall record in the register relating to the company a minute of the dissolution of the company and (b) direct the Company Liquidator to forward a copy of the order to the Registrar who shall record in the register relating to the company a minute of the dissolution of the company.	None
Where a company has been dissolved, such dissolution may be set aside within a period of two years from the date of such dissolution under section 356 of the Companies Act, 2013.	Reasoning
Given the aforesaid scheme of winding up under Chapter XX of the Companies Act, 2013, it is clear that several stages are contemplated, with the Tribunal retaining the power to control the proceedings in a winding up petition even after it is admitted.	Reasoning
Thus, in a winding up proceeding where the petition has not been served in terms of Rule 26 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 at a preadmission stage, given the beneficial result of the application of the Code, such winding up proceeding is compulsorily transferable to the NCLT to be resolved under the Code.	Reasoning
Even post issue of notice and pre admission, the same result would ensue.	Reasoning
However, post admission of a winding up petition and after the assets of the company sought to be wound up become in custodia legis and are taken over by the Company Liquidator, section 290 of the Companies Act, 2013 would indicate that the Company Liquidator may carry on the business of the company, so far as may be necessary, for the beneficial winding up of the company, and may even sell the company as a going concern.	Reasoning
So long as no actual sales of the immovable or movable properties have taken place, nothing irreversible is done which would warrant a Company Court staying its hands on a transfer application made to it by a creditor or any party to the proceedings.	Reasoning
It is only where the winding up proceedings have reached a stage where it would be irreversible, making it impossible to set the clock back that the Company Court must proceed with the winding up, instead of transferring the proceedings to the NCLT to now be decided in accordance with the provisions of the Code.	Reasoning
Whether this stage is reached would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.	Reasoning
In the facts of the present case, the concurrent finding of the Company Judge and the Division Bench is that despite the fact that the liquidator has taken possession and control of the registered office of the appellant company and its factory premises, records and books, no irreversible steps towards winding up of the appellant company have otherwise taken place.	Reasoning
This being so, the Company Court has correctly exercised the discretion vested in it by the 5th proviso to section 434(1)(c).	Reasoning
Resultantly, civil appeal arising out of SLP (Civil) No.26415 of 2019 stands dismissed.	Decision
Civil Appeal Nos. 40424043 of 2020 (arising out of SLP (Civil) Nos. 20332034 of 2020)	None
Given the fact that the matter has been transferred by the High Court to the NCLT to verify the necessary facts and circumstances of the case, after which relief can be given to the appellant herein, we do not find any reason to interfere with the aforesaid order.	Decision
The appeals are therefore dismissed.	Decision
