The Government of India on May 20, 1951, issued a notification giving certain terms to assessees if they disclosed their hidden income or income which had escaped taxation.	Facts
We are not concerned with the e,act concessions given but only with the question whether this notification was also concerned with the assessment under the Excess Profits Tax Act.	Facts

It was also pointed out that only Income Tax Officers were mentioned in various parts of the Notification and no reference was made to excess Profits Tax Officers.	Facts

The High Court states.	Facts
In the challans, which are Exs.	None
P3 to P6, the head Supertax, Miscellaneous Surcharge and Excess Profits Tax are scored and only the head Income tax is left in tact, indicating thereby that the demands related only to Income tax and not to Excess Profits Tax.	Facts

According to the plaintiffs, on August 11, 1953, for the first time the Income Tax Officer wrote to A.N. Padmanabha Shenoi that Excess Profits Tax was also payable under the voluntary disclosure statements for 1119, 1120 and 1121.	Facts

However, on August 25,1953, A.N. Padmanabha Shenoi took the position that no excess profits tax was due as the assessments in respect of excess profits tax for the years 1119, 1120 and 1121 became final by the orders of the Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax in Excess Profit Appeal Nos.	Facts

A.P. Damodara Shenoi son of late A.N. Padmanabha Shenoi, and A.P. Narasinga Shenoi, brother of A.P.	Facts

Padmanabha Shenoi are not defaulters in the payment of Income Tax, that the demand notices dated 3121954 to the tune of Rs. 55,200150 mentioned in para 4 supra are void, their issue being beyond the competence of the defendants for the reasons stated above, and restraining the defendants by a permanent injunction from enforcing the said demand by any coercive process (B) declaring that no excess profits tax is leviable by the defendants or the Income Tax Department from the plaintiffs or the Estate of the late A.N.

The Trial Court held that Padmanabha Shenoi had not agreed to pay excess profits tax on the disclosed income as per the statements made by him on April 25, 1952 and July 31, 1953.	Facts
The Trial Court observedThere is no record at all to show that either the plaintiffs or their father agreed to pay excess profits taxThere is also no case of an oral agreement to pay E.P.T. The Trial Court further heldAdmittedly all the challans for payment of income tax were filled up and issued from the Income tax Office under the direction of DW.I. All other items except income tax have been scored off and the amounts are paid into the Treasury towards the head Income taxIt was for the first time on 11th August, 1953, that the adjustment of Rs. 71,85190 was made by the Income tax OfficerThe letter is not an assessment order.	Facts
The Income tax Officer does not say under what authority he has adjusted the said amount towards E. P.TThere is nothing in Ex.	None
D9 to show that either Padmanabha Shenoi or his son the first plaintiff agreed to pay the E.P.T.	None
The Trial Court further heldif payments are already made towards income tax, they could not be readjusted or re opened, the demand notices for payment of income tax cannot be considered to be valid, because no amount remains to be paid towards income tax.	None

10.	None
The defendant appealed to the High Court.	Facts
The High Court upheld all the findings of the Trial Court but observedHaving assessed excessprofits tax, the department has allowed deduction in regard thereto in the assessment of Income tax for the relevant years.	Facts
As the assessee is found not liable to excessprofits tax and has not therefore to pay the same, we must necessarily quash the deduction made by the department and declare the assessee liable to pay Income tax (inclusive of Supertax) on the income disclosed by him.	Facts
Counsel for the Revenue has submitted a statement showing the amount of tax payable by the plaintiffs as the legal representatives of the assessee if no deduction for excessprofits tax is made, and has served a copy thereof on counsel for the plaintiff respondents who has conceded the correctness thereof before us.	Facts
Under that statement a sum of Rs. 21,884130 remains due from the plaintiffs to the department.	None

The learned counsel for the plaintiffs in Civil Appeal No. 100 of 1966 contends that the High Court erred in holding (a) that the demand notices P23, P24 and P25 were valid to the extent of Rs. 21,884/81	Arguments of Petitioner
and (b) that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a refund of Rs. 16,650/ with interest from September 22, 1954.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel for the defendant in Civil Appeal No.101 of 1966 contends that the High Court erred in holding (a) that the father of the plaintiffs, A.N.Padmanabha Shenoi had not agreed to pay Excess Profits Tax.	Arguments of Respondent
(b) that, at any rate, he was estopped from saying that he had not agreed to pay Excess Tax and (c) that the suit was barred by the provisions of S.111 of the Cochin Income Tax Act of 1117 M. E., which interalia, provides that no suit shall be brought in any civil court to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act.	Arguments of Respondent
We will first deal with the points raised Civil Appeal No. 101 of 1966 by the learned counsel for the defendant, seriatin. 12.	None
Whether the plaintiffs father had agreed to pay Excess Profits Tax in addition to Income Tax is a question of fact.	Issue
Both the Trial Court and the High Court have found that there was no such agreement.	None
No writing is produced in support of this contention.	Reasoning
The notification of the Government of India, dated May 20, 1951, does not mention Excess Profits Tax or Excess Profits Tax Officers.	Reasoning
We have not been shown any material to enable us to set aside this concurrent findings in the result it must be held that it is not proved that the pliantiffs father had agreed to pay Excess Profits Tax.	Reasoning
13.	None
There is also no force in the plea of estoppel.	Reasoning
Apart from the fact that in the letter dated August, 19, 1953, the plaintiffs father did not contest his liability to pay Excess Profits Tax, no fact has been brought to our notice which could sustain the plea of estoppel.	Reasoning
It appears that the plaintiffs father in the letter dated August 25, 1953, definitely took the stand that no Excess Profits Tax was due.	Reasoning
The learned counsel for the defendant also relied on the payment of Rs.1,04,628/13/ under four challans dated March 23, 1952, February 25, 1953, March 27, 1963 and August 25, 1953.	Reasoning
But both the Trial Court and the High Court have found that in these challans the heads Super Tax, Miscellaneous, Surcharge and Excess Profits Tax were scored out.	Reasoning
In our opinion, there is no force in this point.	Reasoning
14.	None
The last point regarding jurisdiction is equally without any substance.	Reasoning
First, no such point was raised in the Trial Court or the High Court.	Reasoning
It appears that the defendant successfully pleaded in the writ petitions filed in the High Court that the proper remedy for the plaintiffs was a suit and not a writ petition under Art.226.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, there is no force in this point.	Reasoning
Section III of the Cochin Income Tax Act of 1117 M.E. bars a suit to set aside an assessment.	Reasoning
No prayer was made in the suit for setting aside any assessment.	Reasoning
What was claimed in the suit was that the plaintiffs father had not agreed to pay Excess Profits Tax and the Department had no jurisdiction to appropriate payments made towards Income Tax to Excess Profits Tax, due not under any assessment orders made under the Excess Profits Tax but under executive orders or calculations made on the supposition that the plaintiffs father had agreed to pay tax.	Reasoning
Such a suit, in our opinion, lies wholly outside the scope of S.III.	Reasoning
We may here deal with the question of refund of Rs.16,650/ ordered by the Trial Court but denied by the High Court.	Reasoning
The learned counsel for the plaintiffs says that the plaintiffs have filed an application or applications for refund and as these applications have not been disposed of yet he does not press for the passing of a decree for the refund of Rs.16,650/. In view of this statement we do not consider it necessary to deal with the point whether the High Court was right in reversing the Trial Court on this point.	Reasoning
In the result we hold that there is no merit in the appeal filed by the defendant.	Reasoning
Civil Appeal No.101 of 1966 is accordingly dismissed with costs.	Reasoning
15.	None
Coming to the plaintiffs appeal, we are of the view that the High Court erred in holding that the demand notices P23, P24 and P25 were valid to the extent of Rs. 21,884/81.	Reasoning
This sum was arrived at by revising the assessment orders, not under any provision of the Income Tax Act, but by the counsel for the revenue.	None
The assessment orders stand as they were before.	Reasoning
We are unable to appreciate how the assessment orders can be revised except under the provisions of the Income Tax Act.	Reasoning
Neither the counsel for the defendant nor the High Court has power to revise any assessment orders.	Reasoning
Indeed, S.111 of the Cochin Income Tax Act interdicts the High Court.	Reasoning
It is true the High Court has not done it directly, but indirectly it has done so.	Reasoning
Consequently we set aside the finding of the High Court that the demand notices P23.	Decision
P 24 and P25 were valid to the extent of Rs.21,884/81. 16.	None
In the result Civil Appeal No. 110/66 succeeds to the extent indicated above.	Decision
The plaintiffs will have their costs in this Court.	Decision
17.	None
There will be one hearing fee in both the appeals.	Decision
