 Alagiriswami, J.1.	None
These appeals raise the question of the validity of certain rules made under the Rajasthan Colonisation Act. 1954.	Issue
The facts necessary for the decision of this case are as follows2.	Facts
Jaila Singh, the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1704 of 1974, was allotted 50 bighas of uncommand land, in the years 195657 and 195758 in the Ganganagar District of the Rajasthan State.	Facts
The area in which the land is situated was declared, a Colony Area of the Rajasthan Canal project under the Act in 1960.	Facts
In 1967 the Rajasthan Colonisation (Rajasthan Canal Project Government Land Allotment and Sale) Rules, 1967 were promulgated and applications were invited for allotment of land under those rules.	Facts
Jaila Singhs application for allotment was disposed of on 27 l21969 by allotting 14 bighas and 14 biswas of land on permanent basis.	Facts
These 1967 Rules were the subject matter of certain writ petitions before the Rajasthan High Court which ended with the decision of that Court in State v. Ramdhan (AIR 1973 Raj 71 ) striking down certain of those Rules.	Facts
Thereafter two sets of Rules called respectively Rajasthan Colonisation (Rajasthan Canal Project Pre1955 Temporary Tenants Government Land Allotment) Conditions.	Facts
1971 and the Rajasthan Colonisation (Allotment of Government Land to Post1955 .	Facts
Temporary Cultivation Lease Holders and other Landless Persons in the Rajasthan Canal Project Area)	Facts
Rules, 1971 were promulgated.	Facts
Applications were again invited for allotment of land, under the Post1955 Rules and Jaila Singh was allotted another 10 bighas of land.	Facts
The rest of the land originally allotted to him reverted to the State.	Facts
He filed a writ petition before the Rajasthan High Court challenging the Post1955 Rules as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.	Facts
He prayed that the Rajasthan Colonisation Act, 1954 may be declared to be illegal or in the alternative the Post1955 Rules may be declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution and for an appropriate order in respect of the lands allotted , to him.3.	Facts
Sahi Ram, the husband of the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 1705 of 1974.	Facts
had been allotted 24 1/2 bighas of land for temporary cultivation in Rajasthan Canal Area in Ganganagar District.	Facts
He had also been allotted 13 1/2 bighas of command land in the year 1952 on a permanent basis and 6 bighas and 12 biswas of command land and 4 bighas and 11 biswas of uncommand land for permanent cultivation.	Facts
These lands were included in the Colony Area of the Rajasthan Canal Project in 1960.	Facts
After the post1955 Rules came into force the 24 1/2 bighas land was ordered to be resumed on the ground that Sahi Ram was not a landless person.	Facts
In the writ petition filed by the appellant the contentions and prayers were the same as in Jaila Singhs case.	Facts
We shall deal with them at the appropriate places in so far as they relate to matters raised in the appeal.4.	Facts
In both the writ petitions the contention on behalf of the State of Rajasthan was that owing to the insertion of Section 15A in the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 Khatedari rights could not accrue to the tenants under Section .15	Facts
(1) of the said Act and the possession of such tenants was given protection who were holding since 151055 and thereafter upto the commencement of the Pre1955 Conditions by making permanent allotment under the Pre1955 Conditions.	Facts
The various impugned rules were contended not to be discriminatory.5.	Facts
Justice Gupta of the Rajasthan High Court who heard the two writ petitions filed by Jaila Singh and Dhapi Bai, in a batch of 340 writ petitions, upheld the validity of the Prel955 Conditions as well as the Post l955 Rules.	Facts
He took the view that the question of discrimination can arise only in respect of persons, who are similarly situated, that the pre1955 tenants cannot be said to stand on the same footing as the post1955 tenants inasmuch as the two classes of tenants came into temporary cultivation at different periods of time and cannot be said to be similarly situated.	Facts
The fact that the pre1955 tenants had been continuously in possession for a longer period was held to make them a separate class from the temporary cultivators who came into possession after October 15, 1955.	Facts
The contention of the Rajasthan State on the basis of Section 15A of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act was also accepted on appeal against the decision of Justice Gupta a Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court dismissed the appeals even at the admission stage.6.	Facts
Before we proceed to consider the various contentions it is necessary to set out certain important provisions of the Act and the Rules.7.	None
The Rajasthan Colonisation Act, 1954 came into force on 17th December,1954.	None
It defined tenant as meaning any person holding land in a colony and including his predecessors and successorsininterest and transferees.	None
Colony was defined as meaning any area to which the Act shall be applied.	None
Section 7 of the Act reads7.	None
Issue of Statement of conditions of tenancy (1) The State Government may grant land in a colony to any person on such conditions as may be prescribed.(2)	None
The State Government may issue a statement or statements of the conditions on which it is willing to grant land in a colony to tenants.(3).	None
Where such statements of conditions have been issued, the Collector may, subject to the control of the State Government, allot land to any person, to be held subject to such conditions contained in the statement issued under subsection (2) of this section as the Collector may, by written order declare to be applicable to the case.(4)	None
No person shall be deemed to be a tenant or to have any right or title in the land allotted to him until such a written order has been passed and he has taken possession of the land with the permission of the Collector, and after possession has been so taken, the grant shall be held subject to the conditions declared applicable thereto.	None
Section 28 reads28.	None
Power to make rules  The State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette make rules generally for carrying into effect the provisions and purposes of this Act and in particular for all matters which are prescribed thereunder.	None
It would be noticed that there is practically no guidance provided in the Act with regard to the principles to be applied in the matter of allotment of land.8.	None
Under the provisions of that Act the Rajasthan Colonisation (Bhakra Project Government Land Allotment and Sale) Rules. 1955 were made and came into effect on 25th December, 1955.	None
The extent of land which could be allotted to those cultivating Government lands since before December 31, 1947 was 80 bighas if the joint family consists of adult male members not exceeding five and 15 bighas of additional area per additional member if the number of members is in excess of five.	None
In the case of those cultivating lands since after 31st December 1947, 25 bighas could be allotted for a joint family consisting of three adult male members and 15 bighas for every adult male member in excess of three.	None
Thus the difference between pre1947 and post l947 tenants is negligible.9.	None
Under the Rajasthan Colonisation (Gang Canal Lands Permanent Allotment and Sale) Rules, 1956 the scale of allotment is uniform without any discrimination between various classes of persons to whom land may be allotted.10.	None
Under the Rajasthan Colonisation (Rajasthan Canal Project Government Land Allotment and Sale Rules, 1967 all post1955 temporary cultivation leases in the Colony Area were terminated and all the lands covered by such leases reverted to the Government.	None
Rule 16 reads16.	None
A joint family shall, for the purposes of existing holdings and of allotment of land under these Rules, be deemed to be one person and dealt with accordingly.	None
No. separation or partition effected after the l5th October, 1955 will be taken into consideration.	None
Under Rule 19 Bhakra landless persons were entitled to 15 bighas in each case so also landless tenants.	None
Tenure tenants who held land less than 15 bighas in their khatas and the whole or part thereof was with a subtenant, not liable to ejectment were entitled to allotment of so much of Government land as would render their khatas equal to 15 bighas.	None
Here again there was no discrimination in the matter of allotment of land among the various classes of persons to whom land may be allotted.	None
After Rr. 16 and 19 read with R. 7 (x) and (xi) were struck down by the Rajasthan High Court these Rules were repealed and the Pre1955 .	None
Conditions and Post1955 Rules were promulgated.11.	None
The Rajasthan Colonisation (Rajasthan canal Project Pre1955 Temporary Tenants Government Land Allotment) Conditions, 1971 came into effect on 321971.	Facts
A pre1955 temporary tenant was defined as a person who is resident of Rajasthan since before the 1st day of April, 1955 and who has been holding and been in possession of temporary cultivation land continuously since before the 16th day of October, 1955, upto the date of commencement of these Conditions (portion not necessary for the purposes of this case omitted) .	None
All temporary leases of Government lands of pre1955,temporary tenants were cancelled.	None
A temporary tenant holding mare than 25 bighas of command temporary cultivation land could be allotted up to the ceiling limit, the ceiling limit being 50 bighas.	None
A temporary tenant holding less than 25 bighas may be allotted the land in his, possession as well as further extent, of land making the total upto 25 bighas.	None
In the case of persons having more than 25 bighas no price was chargeable for allotment upto 25 bighas.	None
But, persons having less than 25 bighas had to pay the price for lands allotted to them to make up 25 bighas, that is, land in excess of what they already had.	None
The effect of these provisions was to take a concrete example, that if a man had 30 bighas of land the whole of it would be allotted to him.	None
If he had 60 bighas of land 10 bighas will be taken away.	None
He will have to pay the value of the land in excess of 25 bighas.	None
Where a person had less than 25 bighas  whether it is 14 or 16 bighas he will be given another 11 or 9 bighas as the case may be and he need not make any payment for the land he already had but need pay only for the land newly allotted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus a person holding lands in excess of 25 bighas was at a distinct advantage in that he could keep the land in excess of 25 bighas, and upto 50 bighas by paying the value only for the excess, compared to the man who had less than 25 bighas who could be given land upto 25 bighas.	Reasoning
The discrimination between the two classes is obvious and no justification has been put forward nor can be put forward for this discrimination.12.	Reasoning
The Rajasthan Colonisation (Allotment of Government Land to Post1955 Temporary Cultivation.	None
Lease Holders and other Landless Persons in the Rajasthan Canal Project Area )	Facts
Rules, 1971 which came into effect on 451971 described a landless person in R. 2 (1) (xiii) as followsLandless Person means a person who is resident of Rajasthan since before the 1st day of April, 1955 and is by profession a bona fide agriculturist or bona fide agricultural labourer and whose primary source of income is agriculture.	None
Provided that such person neither holds any tenure land anywhere in excess of 15 bighas nor is he a subtenant of any such land (in excess of 15 bighas) from which he is not liable to ejectment under the provisions of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 (Rajasthan Act 3 of 1955) or under any other law for the time being in force in the area in which the land is situated nor, he is entitled for permanent allotment of 15 bighas or more land anywhere under any other rules, conditions or law.	None
A landless person coming under these rules could be allotted up to 25 bighas provided that if such person holds or is a subtenant of any land anywhere, he will be allotted only so much Government land as together with his existing holding does not exceed 25 bighas.	None
There is a proviso that such land shall be allotted to him only if such land is available adjacent to his existing holding or in the same village.	None
The result of this rule read with the definition of landless person is that if he holds land anywhere in excess of 15 bighas he will not get any further allotment.	None
In other words if he had 14 bighas of land he may be allotted 11 bighas whereas if he has got 16 bighas of land he will not be allotted any further land.	None
The discrimination against him as against the pre1955 tenant who had less than 25 bighas is apparent.	None
The latter will get 9 bighas even if he had already 16 bighas.	None
The word anywhere in the definition of the term landless person as well as in the rule relating to eligibility for allotment has been the subject matter of some controversy but it is not necessary to resolve it, for the purpose of these cases.	None
The contrast between the pre1955 conditions and the post1955 Rules is thus apparent.	None
The only justification put forward on behalf of the Government before the High Court was that Section 15A of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 made a difference and the learned Single Judge of the Rajasthan High Court held that the length of the occupation of the lands by the pre1955 and post1955 tenanats provided a basis for classification.13.	None
Before us the only questions argued were regarding the discrimination between the pre1955 and post1955 tenants based on the fact that1.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the case of the former persons having more than 25 bighas could keep all the lands they had up to the ceiling limit and had to pay only for the land in excess of 25 bighas.2.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even among them persons having less than 25 bighas, whether below 15 or above 15 bighas could get land to enable them to have 25 bighas and they need pay only for the excess over what they had.3.	Arguments of Petitioner
Post1955 tenants could not get anything if they had over 15 bighas and they had to pay for the land allotted to them to make up 25 bighas.	Arguments of Petitioner
These contentions are so substantial and the discrimination so striking and the justification attempted so feeble that we have no hesitation in accepting them.	None
We have already referred to some of them.14.	Reasoning
We are unable to see the nexus between the pre1955 Conditions and post1955 Rules and the Rajasthan Tenancy Act which came into force on 15101955.In these cases we are concerned with the validity of the rules relating to the allotment of Government land which had been given on temporary leases to various persons whether before 1955 or after 1955.	Reasoning
Both sets of leases had been cancelled by the relevant pre1955 Condition and post1955 Rule and there is no dispute that the Pre1955 leases cannot be cancelled while post l955 leases could be cancelled.	Reasoning
The Rajasthan Tenancy Act is not concerned with that question.	Reasoning
Proviso to Section 15 of that Act specifically provides that no Khatedari rights shall accrue under that section to any tenant, to whom land is or has been let out temporarily in Gang Canal Bhakra, Chambal or Jawai Project area, or any other area notified in that behalf by the State Government.	Reasoning
Admittedly the Rajasthan Canal area has been included within the scope of this proviso by a notification.	Reasoning
To make matters more clear Section 15A also provides that the land in the Rajasthan Canal area leased out on any terms whatsoever shall be deemed to have been let out temporarily within the meaning of the proviso earlier mentioned and no Khatedari rights shall accrue or shall be deemed ever to have accrued in any such land leased out as aforesaid.	Reasoning
This provision thus applies to both pre1955 as well as post1955 leases.	Reasoning
Both these leases stand on the same footing and therefore do not form different classes.15.	Reasoning
The reference to Ss. 15 and 15A of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act in deciding the questions that arise in these cases is therefore wholly irrelevant.	Reasoning
Nor are we satisfied that the length of occupation of the lands provides any proper criterion for the distinction between pre1955 and post1955 tenants.	Reasoning
There is nothing to show how long before 15th October 1955 pre1955 tenants were given temporary leases and in the absence of such material, it is impossible to see how any differentiation can be made between pre1955 and Post1955 tenants in the matter of permanent allotment of land.	Reasoning
Even in 1967 when the 1967 Rules were made no distinction was sought to be made between pre1955 and post1955 tenants.	Reasoning
By that time many of post  l955 tenants would have been in possession for about 12 years and in 1971 they would have been in possession for about 16 years.	Reasoning
It is difficult to appreciate how it should make any difference from the point of view of allotment of land, whether a tenant has been in occupation for 16 years or 18 or 20 years and why differentiation should be made with reference to the date when the Rajasthan Tenancy Act came into force.	Reasoning
The 1967 Rules no doubt provide for cancellation of all post1955 temporary cultivation leases but in actual effect it made no difference.	Reasoning
Under these Rules persons eligible for allotment were landless tenants.	Reasoning
Landless tenant was defined as a bona fide agriculturist who is a resident of Rajasthan since before 1st April 1955 and who cultivates or can reasonably be expected to cultivate land personally but who does not hold any land in his own name or in the name of any member of his joint family and who is not a subtenant of any land, owner or land holder holding tenure khatas under proprietary, mauroosee or khatedari rights and is not liable to ejectment under the provisions of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 or under any other law for the time being in force in the area in which the land is situated or who holds only a fragment of land measuring 15 bighas.	Reasoning
No distinction was made between pre1955 and Post1955 tenants in the matter of allotment.	Reasoning
Provided an agriculturist had less than 15 bighas he was entitled to allotment of land.	Reasoning
The allotment was also to an extent sufficient to make up 25 bighas of command land.	Reasoning
Here again no distinction was made between post1955 and prel955 tenants, Nor was there any difference in the sale price to be paid by the different classes of allottees.16.	Reasoning
In AIR 1973 Raj. 71	None
(supra) only the latter part of Rule 16 and Rule 19 (a) (iii) read with Rule 7 (x) and (xi) were struck down.	None
Rule 7 (x) reserved land for allotment to landless tenants belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes up to 1 lakh acres to be allotted at the rate of 15 bighas per family and Rule 7 (xi) for other landless tenants upto 50,000 acres to be allotted, at the rate of 15 bighas per family.	None
They were struck down only on the ground that both the Bhakra Canal Project Rules and the Rajasthan Canal Rules had been framed under the Rajasthan Colonisation Act.	None
1954	None
but they treated the unit of family differently and cannot therefore be justified.	None
By the same reasoning no distinction can be made between pre1955 and post1955 tenants by rules made under the same Act.17.	None
One of the arguments attempted before us, though it was not pleaded before the Rajasthan High Court was that in the case of the post1955 tenants a smaller area had to be allotted because of the pressure for land.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have already pointed out that the difference in the period of occupation between the pre1955 and post1955 tenants could not be of such an extent as to justify allotment of , larger extent, of land to the pre1955 tenants than to the post1955 tenants nor for the discrimination even among the pre1955 tenants between those holding more than 25 bighas and those holding less than 25 bighas.	Reasoning
If the Rajasthan Government wanted to act fairly by all classes of residents of Rajasthan they could very well have omitted portions in the 1967 Rules found objectionable by the Rajasthan High Court and therefore struck down and there would have been nothing more to say.	Reasoning
The striking down of Rules 16 and 19 of the 1967 Rules did not necessitate the promulgation of two wholly new sets of rules.	Reasoning
In that case only 15 bighas of land would have been available to each allottee and there would have been no discrimination between one class of persons and another.	Reasoning
There would also have been greater extent of land available for allotment to a larger number of persons at the rate of 15 bighas each.	None
One of the justifications pleaded on behalf of the State of Rajasthan for the definition of the landless tenants in the post1955 Rules as persons holding less than 15 bighas of land was that 15 bighas was a viable unit.	Arguments of Respondent
In that case it is all the more reason why all allottees whether pre1955 or post1955 should get 15 bighas.	Arguments of Respondent
We are unable to see any justification for treating the Pre1955 and post1955 tenants differently.	None
What prompted the Rajasthan State to do so in 1971 when they did not do so in 1967 and the decision of the Raiasthan High Court in regard to the 1967 Rules did not compel them to do so is beyond our comprehension.	Reasoning
We are not able to accept the contention that they belonged to two different classes.	Reasoning
By that standard any arbitrary difference could be fixed and it could be said that persons who got temporary leases before that date belonged to one, class and the persons who had been allotted land after that date formed another class.	Reasoning
We have already shown that the Rajasthan Tenancy Act has no relevance at all to the decision of this question and therefore 15101955, the date on which it came into force, has no relevance to the classification attempted by pre1955 and post1955 tenants.	Reasoning
The classification must have a nexus with the object sought to be achieved.	Reasoning
We can see no such nexus in this case.	Reasoning
We thus find that the definition of the landless tenants as well as the rules for allotment in the post 1955 Rules as compared to the pre1955 conditions are discriminatory and unjustifiable.18.	Reasoning
As regards the discrimination in the matter of payment of price between the pre1955 and post1955 tenants, it was urged on behalf of the State of Rajasthan that this was not urged in the writ petitions of the two appellants and so cannot be gone into by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
The question of price has been raised in the two writ petitions but it was on a different aspect and not on the question that the pre1955 tenants did not have to pay any price while post1955 tenants had to do so.	None
But it has been argued before the learned Single Judge, and he has dealt with it apparently without any objection being taken to it on the part of the State of Rajasthan.	Reasoning
This question of price is not mentioned as one of the matters which were raised before the Division Bench which heard the appeal.	Reasoning
We find it difficult to conceive of the appellants having given up that plea before the Appellate Bench having argued it before the learned.	Reasoning
Single Judge.	None
It is urged on behalf of the State of Rajasthan that there may be reasons why pre1955 tenants are treated differently in the matter of payment of price.	Arguments of Respondent
If there were any, they were not put forward before the learned Single Judge.	None
But as materials regarding it are not available before us, we propose to say nothing about it.	Reasoning
But we may point out that, as the rules stand there seems to be some discrimination in the matter of price between pre1955 and post1955 tenants, in that pre1955 tenants, who hold land exceeding 25 bighas, have to pay nothing for land up to 25 bighas, while post1955 tenants, who hold land less than 15 bighas, have to pay price for land which may be allotted to them so as to make up 25 bighas.	Reasoning
We are mentioning this only so that the State may look into the matter of price and set it right to avoid any discrimination.	Reasoning
There seems to be no difficulty at all in all this because none of the tenants, whether they are pre1955 or post1955 tenants, have any vested rights.	Reasoning
It is the duty of the State to treat fairly all classes of tenants in the Rajasthan Canal Area whether pre1955 or post1955 tenants.19.	Reasoning
No arguments were advanced regarding the validity of the Act and we think rightly so.	Reasoning
The arguments were confined to Condition 3 and proviso to Condition 9 of pre1955 Conditions and Rules 2 (1) (xiii) and 3 (2) of the post1955 Rules.	Reasoning
In effect appellants had no objection to paying for extra land to be allotted to them.	Reasoning
They object only to the discrimination against them as compared to the pre1955 tenants.20.	Reasoning
In the result we hold that Condition No. 3 of the Pre1955 Conditions and the definition of landless person as contained in Rule 2 (1) (xiii) as well as Rule 3 (2) of the Postl955 Rules are void as they are discriminatory under Article 14 of the Constitution and they are struck down.	Decision
It is open to the State to frame new rules applying to both pre1955 and post1955 tenants without any discrimination between them.21.	Decision
The appeals are allowed to the extent indicated above.	Decision
The appellants will get their costs from the respondents, hearing fee one set.22.	Decision
Appeals allowed.	None
