Reasoning
In order to appreciate the contention raised by the appellantaccused that the courts below have failed to properly analyse and scrutinise the evidence of the solitary witness and that the presence of the said solitary witness at the place of occurrence was not natural and also that his testimony was not free from embellishment, we are required to mention brief facts as alleged by the prosecution.4.

The accused was charged u s 302 IPC as well as u s 309 IPC.	Facts
However, the charge u s 309 IPC was deleted subsequently.	Facts
In order to substantiate its case, the prosecution examined 12 witnesses in all.	Facts
Harjinder Singh who was the eye witness and complainant was examined as PW7.	Reasoning
Manjit Singh, Sarpanch, the alleged eye witness was also examined as PW6 but he did not support the prosecution version, not even the presence of PW7 at the time of occurrence.	Reasoning
Consequently he was declared hostile.	Reasoning
Chanan Singh another alleged eye witness was given up on the ground that he has been won over by the accused.	Facts
In the FIR it was stated by PW7, the alleged eye witness, that the deceased brother first gave a knife blow in the chest of the accused and thereafter the accused gave two stab blows with his knife on the person of deceased.	Reasoning
The same set of allegation was made by said PW7 even before the police during the course of investigation.	Reasoning
However, during the trial he stated that there was an exchange of hot words between the accused and the deceased consequent to which the accused gave two stab blows with the knife to the deceased, one of which fell on the chest whereas the other on the right flank of the deceased.	Reasoning
It was also stated in the evidence by the said PW7 that on seeing that the deceased had died the accused attempted to commit suicide by plunging the knife on the left side of his chest.	Facts
On the other hand, the accused put forth that he was learning driving from the deceased, who was his friend.	Facts
He stated that on the day of the occurrence three unidentified person hired the van of the deceased and on reaching the spot, deceased refused to take his van on kacha path and those person picked up a row with him and they assaulted both the deceased and the accused with the Gatra Kirpan due to which both of them suffered injuries.	Reasoning
He further stated that he became unconscious on receipt of injury in his stomach and subsequently he was involved in this case.	Reasoning
The learned Additional Sessions Judge, on appreciation of the evidence on record held that though the injury on the accused could have been self inflicted as stated by the doctor, but even considering that the same was inflicted in selfdefence, the right of selfdefence to the extent of causing the death of the deceased was not available to the accused.	Reasoning
On noticing and appreciating the fact that there was allegation of an exchange of hot words and that the incident occurred at the spur of the moment without any premeditation, the learned Additional Sessions Judge found the accused guilty and convicted him under Section 304 Part II IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for eight years.	Facts
On an appeal being filed by the appellant as against the aforesaid order of conviction and sentence the learned Single Judge heard the parties on merits.	Facts
While maintaining the finding of guilt against the appellant the learned Single Judge, however, convicted the appellant under Section 304 Part I IPC by altering the same from one under Section 304 Part II IPC.	Facts
However, taking into consideration the fact that the accused has become permanently physically handicapped and his disability is 80 the learned Single Judge reduced the sentence to five years instead of eight years.	Facts
The accused filed the present appeal as against the aforesaid orders.	Facts
We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellantaccused as also learned counsel appearing for the State and also scrutinised the evidence on record.	Reasoning
The learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted before us that the presence of PW7, the only eye witness supporting the alleged story of the prosecution, at the spot is too providential to be true.	Reasoning
It was also submitted that although it is alleged that the First Information Report was recorded at 10.30 or 11.00 p.m., but in the inquest report which was drawn at 7.00 a.m. on the next day, in the place of the F.I.R number no particulars were given and only a dash was shown and the F.I.R number was inserted at the later point of time.	Arguments of Petitioner
Relying on the said fact it was submitted that the first information report was submitted late and belatedly on the next date i.e. on 16.11.1993 at about 9.00 a.m.	Reasoning
He further submitted that the statement of PW7 is full of embellishment and contradictions from his previous statement.	Reasoning
He drew our attention to the allegation made in the first information report and to the statement of said PW7.	Reasoning
He submitted that said PW7 is neither trustworthy nor reliable, and therefore, the appellant should have been acquitted instead of being convicted in the aforesaid manner.	Reasoning
The learned counsel appearing for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that both the courts below namely the High Court and the learned Additional Sessions Judge found the appellant guilty of the offence and the said findings and conclusion reached should not be interfered with.	Reasoning
The learned Additional Sessions Judge found the appellant guilty of the offence and convicted the appellantaccused under Section 304 Part II IPC.	Reasoning
The prosecution did not file any appeal as against the aforesaid order of conviction and sentence whereas the appellantaccused filed an appeal against his order of conviction.14.	Reasoning
It is established fact that the offence of Section 304 Part I IPC is of a higher degree than that of the offence under Section 304 Part II IPC, as also held in Ruli Ram v. State of Haryana (2002) 7 SCC 691, Para 8.	Reasoning
The learned Single Judge, therefore, was not justified in converting the order of conviction and altering the same from Section 304 Part II IPC to Section 304 Part I IPC, particularly when the prosecution did not file any appeal.	Reasoning
By virtue of the order passed by the learned Single Judge the appellant stood convicted of a higher degree of offence than that of Section 304 Part II IPC, although the learned Single Judge altered the sentence from eight years to five years.	Reasoning
In the case of Abdul Aziz v. State of Rajasthan (2007) 10 SCC 283 it was held by this Court that if a person is charged under a grave Section, but however, if acquitted under the said grave section by the Trial Court, then it would amount to travesty of Justice if in his own appeal he is convicted under that grave section, without there being any appeal from the State and without there being prior notice of enhancement issued by the appellate Court.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, it is necessary now to consider whether the prosecution case as alleged could be said to be trustworthy and reliable, for which we are required to refer and analyse the evidence as adduced by the parties.	Reasoning
According to the prosecution the incident took place on 15.11.1993 at about 6.30 p.m. which was an incident happening on an evening of the winter season.	Reasoning
The deceased who was the brother of PW7 was allegedly driving the van which was parked at the place of incident with windows open and headlights on, which meant that it was dark at that point of time.	Reasoning
Although it was a winter night still the windows of the car were kept open, for which according to the prosecution, PW7 could see the entire incident.	Reasoning
In the first information report PW7 stated that initially a knife blow was given by the deceased to the accused and thereafter the accused gave two knife blows to the deceased, which resulted in his death and consequently his body came out of the window.	Reasoning
The aforesaid version as stated in the first information report, was however, later on changed and altered when PW7 deposed in the court that the accused after giving two knife blows to the deceased attempted to commit suicide by plunging the knife in his chest.	Reasoning
In support of the said contention reliance was placed on the evidence of the doctor who has stated during his examination that the aforesaid injury on the accused could have been self inflicted also.	Reasoning
PW7 is said to be the eye witness who has allegedly seen the entire occurrence including the exchange of hot words between the appellant and the deceased in a winter night and that also when it was totally dark.	Reasoning
According to him, he could see the entire incident in the light of the headlight of the car.17.	None
The aforesaid statement of PW7 does not appear to be trustworthy and reliable for the simple reason that even though the headlight of the car was on, it would be lighting only the front portion and not the side of the car and may not even have lighted sufficiently to enable PW 7 to see as to what had happened inside the car.	Reasoning
Although it was a winter night it is not stated nor understood as to why the windows of the car were kept open.	Reasoning
It is also not stated by PW7 that he had made any effort to help or render assistance to stop the verbal dual between the accused and the deceased or took any effective steps to stop the stabbing on both the persons.	Reasoning
PW7 had further stated that his brother was a driver of the van and that the incident had happened because he was unwilling to take the vehicle by the village path.	Reasoning
However, in his deposition he has stated that his brother was seated at the back seat alongwith the deceased.	Reasoning
It is not understood as to why the driver of the vehicle driving the car would seat in the back seat of the car instead of driving the car from the front seat.	Reasoning
Presence of PW7 at the spot at that point of time was also providential and he has been examined only as a chance witness.	Reasoning
The other alleged eye witness namely Chanan Singh, Member Panchayat of village Kasiana was not examined at all on the ground that he was won over by the accused.	Reasoning
Manjit Singh, Sarpanch who is stated to be the last and third eye witness turned hostile.	Reasoning
Therefore, out of the three eye witnesses one has become hostile whereas the other was not examined at all by the prosecution and we have only one eye witness PW7, who happens to be the brother of the deceased.	None
If his evidence is discarded there is no other evidence on the basis of which the accused could be convicted.	None
It is no doubt true that conviction could be based on the sole testimony of a solitary eye witness but in order to be the basis of conviction his presence at the place of occurrence has to be natural and his testimony should be strong and reliable and free from any blemish.	Reasoning
In Chuhar Singh v. State of Haryana, (1976) 1 SCC 879 this Court held that what is important is not how many witnesses have been examined by the prosecution but what is the nature and quality of evidence on which it relies.	Reasoning
The evidence of a single witness may sustain a sentence of death whereas a host of vulnerable witnesses may fail to support a simple charge of hurt.	Reasoning
Since the case must stand or fall by the evidence of single witness, it is necessary to examine that evidence critically.	Reasoning
However, when we scrutinize the evidence of PW7, in the present case, we do not find him to be trustworthy and reliable witness for he is changing his version frequently.	Reasoning
He had given one version in the F.I.R which is reiterated during the course of investigation before the police whereas he had given a totally different version at the time of his statement before the court.	Reasoning
He had stated in the F.I.R that following the altercation between the deceased and the accused the deceased first gave a knife blow.	Reasoning
When inquest proceedings took place on the next day at 7.00 a.m. he stuck to the same version and during investigation also he confirmed the aforesaid allegation made by him whereas in the trial he stated that the accused first gave two knife blows to the deceased and then he tried to commit suicide by giving a knife blow to himself.	Reasoning
He had also stated that on receiving those two blows the deceased came through the window and fell down on the ground.	Reasoning
The said version also cannot be believed for the deceased after receiving the injuries could not have gone out of the window unless the door was open.	Reasoning
The car was allegedly parked with the headlights on and if that was so, the key of the car was available in the starting ignition switch and, therefore, there was no reason why the said car could not have been driven with the dead body of the deceased and the injured to the hospital as also to the police station by the said PW7 and the other witnesses allegedly with him at that point of time for it has come in evidence that the other witness knew driving as he was driving the tractor.	Reasoning
The prosecution also examined Balbir Singh, PW8, who stated that he is the owner and driver of a taxi and on 15.11.1993	Reasoning
Jarnail Singh hired the taxi of Ramtar in his presence and after that Ramtar never returned.	Reasoning
The deposition of the said witness is also found to be not worthy of reliance for he did not produce any registration certificate.	Reasoning
On his statement that he was owning a taxi, he later said that he had sold the taxi.	Reasoning
He also stated in his evidence that he is unable to recollect as to where from he had purchased the taxi or to whom he had sold his taxi.	Reasoning
He also stated in his deposition that he was holding a forged driving license.	Reasoning
These circumstances make him totally unreliable.	Reasoning
The entire story sought to be put forth by the prosecution and by PW7 particularly appears to be doubtful and full of contradictions.	Reasoning
It will be unsafe to convict a person on the basis of such unreliable and untrustworthy evidence particularly when such statements are full of embellishment and contradictions, without corroboration in material particulars by reliable testimony, direct or circumstantial.	Reasoning
Consequently, we set aside the order of conviction and sentence passed against the appellant and give him benefit of doubt.	Reasoning
He stands acquitted of the charges.	Reasoning
He shall be set free immediately, unless required in any other matter.23.	Reasoning
The appeal is accordingly allowed.	Decision
