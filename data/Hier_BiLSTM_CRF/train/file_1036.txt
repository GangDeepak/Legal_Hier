On the issue of compensation the Tribunal after taking into account all the facts and materials placed before it, came to the conclusion that since the claimant could not prove that the deceased was getting pic7,000/ per month as salary the Tribunal following the principle enunciated in an order of the Uttarakhand High Court, held that notional annual income of the deceased was pic36,000/. The Tribunal also followed the principle laid down in Smt.	Facts
Sarla Verma vs. Delhi Transport Corporation (2009) 6 SCC 121 and held that one third share from the notional income of the deceased should be deducted as his personal expenses to calculate compensation on the basis of the notional annual income of the deceased.	Facts

Facts
3.5 Being aggrieved, an appeal was filed before the High Court.	None
The High Court dismissed the said appeal on the ground that there was no illegality in the award passed by the Tribunal.	Facts
Hence this appeal has been filed.	Facts
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.	None
It has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant that the said award is wrong on the ground that a salary certificate has been produced before the Tribunal and the Tribunal has not accepted the same without any reason.	Arguments of Petitioner
She further submitted that the compensation which has been granted by the Tribunal and affirmed by the High Court does not include the future prospects which should have been added to the claim and further the deduction with regard to the personal expenses could not have been made more than one tenth of the total salary received by the victim.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of such contention, she relied upon Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company Ltd. Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2012) 6 SCC 421 and further submitted that compensation under the head loss of consortium has not been properly assessed by the said Tribunal which has been assessed by this Court in Rajesh vs. Rajbir Singh (2013) 9 SCC 54 and the compensation under the said head should have been awarded for a sum of pic 1,00,000/.	Arguments of Petitioner
She further submitted that the compensation under the head funeral expenses should have been granted as pic 25,000/ and in support of her such contention, she relied upon the aforementioned decisions.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the contrary, it has been stated on behalf of the respondents that in Sarla Verma (supra), the principles laid down by this Court have been followed by the Tribunal and therefore there is no reason to interfere with the award passed by the Tribunal and the appeal dismissed by the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
This Court in Santosh Devi (supra), held as follows We find it extremely difficult to fathom any rationale for the observation made in paragraph 24 of the judgment in Sarla Vermas case that where the deceased was selfemployed or was on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., the Courts will usually take only the actual income at the time of death and a departure from this rule should be made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special circumstances.	None
In our view, it will be nave to say that the wages or total emoluments income of a person who is selfemployed or who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment, etc., would remain the same throughout his life.	None
The rise in the cost of living affects everyone across the board.	None
It does not make any distinction between rich and poor.	None
As a matter of fact, the effect of rise in prices which directly impacts the cost of living is minimal on the rich and maximum on those who are selfemployed or who get fixed income emoluments.	None
They are the worst affected people.	None
Therefore, they put extra efforts to generate additional income necessary for sustaining their families.	None
Therefore, we do not think that while making the observations in the last three lines of paragraph 24 of Sarla Vermas judgment, the Court had intended to lay down an absolute rule that there will be no addition in the income of a person who is selfemployed or who is paid fixed wages.	None
Rather, it would be reasonable to say that a person who is selfemployed or is engaged on fixed wages will also get 30 per cent increase in his total income over a period of time and if he she becomes victim of accident then the same formula deserves to be applied for calculating the amount of compensation.	None
After considering the decisions of this Court in Santosh Devi (supra) as well as Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh (supra), we are of the opinion that it is the duty of the Court to fix a just compensation.	Reasoning
At the time of fixing such compensation, the court should not succumb to the niceties or technicalities to grant just compensation in favour of the claimant.	Reasoning
It is the duty of the court to equate, as far as possible, the misery on account of the accident with the compensation so that the injured or the dependants should not face the vagaries of life on account of discontinuance of the income earned by the victim.	Reasoning
Therefore, it will be the bounden duty of the Tribunal to award just, equitable, fair and reasonable compensation judging the situation prevailing at that point of time with reference to the settled principles on assessment of damages.	Reasoning
In doing so, the Tribunal can also ignore the claim made by the claimant in the application for compensation with the prime object to assess the award based on the principle that the award should be just, equitable, fair and reasonable compensation.	Reasoning
In the instant case, it appears that the Tribunal and the High Court have also failed to consider the factsituation of this case, without taking any pragmatic view and further without considering the priceindex prevailing at the moment, assessed the compensation ignoring the principle laid down by this Court in the recent decisions (see Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh (supra) as also Santosh Devi (supra)) and without revisiting the present situation, came to the conclusion and awarded the total compensation for a sum of pic4,28,000/.	Reasoning
In our opinion, such award suffers from proper assessment of compensation awarded by the Tribunal, and High Court on the conventional heads, i.e., loss of consortium to the spouse, future prospects of the deceased and further the sum awarded under the head funeral expenses, cannot be said to be a just compensation.	Reasoning
In our opinion, there should have been an endeavour on the part of the Tribunal as well as the High Court to consider the inflation factor and further they should have considered the amounts fixed by the court several decades ago on such heads.	Reasoning
Accordingly, as has been pointed out by this Court in Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh (supra), we hold that the compensation under the head loss of consortium to the spouse, loss of love, care and guidance to children and funeral expenses amounts should have been awarded under such heads, that is, for pic1,00,000/ and pic25,000/ respectively and we award such compensation under the said heads.	Reasoning
So far as the head of salary is concerned, we do not express any opinion since we have found that the appellant could not prove the salary certificate and for such reason, we do not intend to interfere with the opinion expressed by the Tribunal on the established principle of notional income and accordingly, we do not want to disturb the said notional income while calculating the total compensation in favour of the appellant.	Reasoning
We have failed to understand why the Tribunal as well as the High Court lost its sight to hold that the victim could have had future prospects with regard to the amounts the victim used to earn during his lifetime?	Reasoning
Therefore, the notional income also needs to be increased by at least 30 and thereby the claimant is entitled to get the benefit of pic900/ being the future prospects the said amount should be added to the notional income of the victim.	Reasoning
Therefore, it appears that the total salary along with future prospects of the victim should have been calculated at pic 3,000/ plus pic 900/ amounting to pic 3,900/ per month.	Reasoning
The total deduction on personal expenses, in our opinion, should have been one third of pic 3,900/ amounting to pic 1,300/.	Reasoning
Therefore, salary after deduction would come to pic 2,600/ and the multiplier should be applied at 17, as has been done correctly by the Tribunal after taking into account the age of the victim.	Reasoning
In this process, the total amount of compensation to be paid would be pic 2,600 x 17 x 12 amounting to pic5,30,400/. We modify and reassess the compensation in accordance with the Calculation Table set out hereunder CALCULATION TABLE Salary (Since it is not proved sufficiently as per the order of the Tribunal)Rs.

The order of the High Court and Tribunal is modified.	Decision
We direct that the claimant appellant is entitled to a sum of pic6,55,400/ plus interest 8 per cent per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of payment as compensation.	Decision
Accordingly, we direct that the enhanced amount should be paid to the appellant after deducting the amount already paid, within a period of four weeks from date.	Decision
For the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeal is partly allowed.	Decision
