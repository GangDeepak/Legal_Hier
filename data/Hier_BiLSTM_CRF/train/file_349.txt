The contract papers entered into between the management and the contractors and the evidence of the witnesses clearly show that contractors had full control and supervision over the work.	Facts
The management had only to see that the labour laws were being implemented and specified approved grade of lime stone was being supplied.(5)	Facts
The contract papers and the evidence show that the contractors had full control over the skilled and professional work.(6)	Facts
It is further clear from the contract papers that the SAIL had right to reject the limestone, if it was not within the specified approved grade as per terms and conditions of the agreement.(7)	Facts
The contract agreements further show that there was penal clause, if there was any breach of contract.	Facts
The Tribunal taking note of the evidence including oral and documentary adduced in support of the reference held that the contract between the Management(SAIL) and the contractors was genuine and not sham and bogus and the contract workers were allowed to continue even after the prohibition notification under Section 10(1) dated 17 th March, 1993 under the CLRA Act on the same terms and conditions and the services of the contract labourer were terminated by the Contractor in April, 1996.13.	Facts
It may be noted that status of the workers after the issuance of notification dated 17 th March, 1993 has also been examined by the Tribunal and held as follows The contract labours after notification cease to function.(2)	Facts
The contract labours were still working in the establishment from 1993 to April 1996 under the umbrella of the contractors who may be called as agent of the Principal employer or were intermediary between the contract labours and the Principal Employer after the publication of notification.(3)	Facts
The contract between the Principal Employer and the contractors after publication of the notification ceases to exist and became not genuine.(4)	Facts
The wages were being paid to the contract labour by the so called contractors in the same way as from before.(5)	Facts
The principal Employer was in need of the workers for the specified works even after the publication of the notification as same workers were continuing in work till April, 1996.(6)	Facts
There is no evidence on the record to show that the principal employer adopted the procedure of regularization and had intended to employ regular workers as has been directed by the Hon?ble Apex Court at Para 125 subpara6 in the Constitution Bench Judgment in the case of SAIL versus National Union Water Front Workers (Supra) after the contract was found genuine before the notification.(7)	Facts
There was no automatic absorption of contract labour on issuing the notification prohibiting the employment of contract labours.(8)	Facts
Contract labours were found employees of the respective contractors before notification.	Facts
At the same time, in para 85 of the Award, the Tribunal further held that after issuance of the prohibition notification dated 17 th March, 1993 in the instant case, the principal employer(SAIL) was prohibited to employ any contract labour in any process, operation or other work in the establishment and when the contract with the contractors after prohibition notification became void and not genuine and the extension of the period of contract of the respective contractors which has been allowed to continue in the establishment by operation of law became abinitio void and sham and bogus.	Facts
Para 85 of the Award is as under ?85.	None
It is an established fact that the notification dated 7393 came to the effect prohibiting the employment of contract labours from the date of its publication.	Facts
As such, in the light of the constitutional bench judgment in SAIL versus National Water Front Workers Union others (Supra) the contract of Principal employer with contractor in regard to the contract labour comes to an end beyond shadow of doubts and the contract with regard to the contract labours subsequently after the notification dated 173 1993 becomes not genuine.	Facts
The Principal employer was prohibited to employ any contract labour in any process, operation or other work in the establishment in any process, operation or other work in the establishment to which the notification relates at any time thereafter.	Facts
It is evident that when the contract of the contractors after notification became itself void and not genuine, the extension of the period of contract of the respective contractors would be abinitio void and sham and bogus.	Facts
Thus it is established that the contract of Principal employer with contractors in regard to the contract labours became subsequently sham and bogus after the notification No. S.O. 707 dated 1731993 coming into the effect from the date of its publication.?	Facts
The Tribunal finally held that the employment of the contract labourer through contractors was not sham and bogus before notification dated 17 th March, 1993, but after publication of the said notification, by operation of law, the contract through contractors could not be considered to be genuine but became void and sham as the contract labour was allowed to continue in the establishment till April 1996.	Facts
It was further observed that the Union is at liberty to take recourse of the penal consequences as mandated under Section 23 to 25 of the CLRA Act.	Facts
Rest of the issues framed by the Tribunal(Issue nos.	Facts
3,4, 5 6) have been consequently decided accordingly under the Industrial Award dated 16 th September, 2009.16.	Facts
The appellant(SAIL) and the workers Union both filed writ petitions in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh.	Facts
The Union assailed the award dated 16 th September, 2009.	Facts
At the same time, SAIL challenged the finding which was recorded in reference to the consequence of the prohibition notification as observed in Para 85 to that extent in the writ petition.17.	Facts
The High Court in its limited scope of judicial review examined the matter as a Court of Appeal reappreciated the evidence threadbare and based on the same set of evidence(oral documentary) reversed the finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal and observed that the contract to be sham and bogus and observed as under ?41.	None
As we have found the contract to be not genuine but mere camouflage in the facts and circumstances and considering prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of CLRA Act, inevitable conclusion is that the contract labours have to be treated as employees of the principal employer.42.	Facts
Considering the large number of workers involved in the instant case and the notification issued under Section 10 of CLRA Act, the regular workmen have to be ultimately employed by the SAIL.	Facts
We decline to grant the backwages to the workers in the instant case.	Facts
It would not be appropriate to saddle the huge liability of back wages.	Facts
However, we direct that the SAIL to start the process of regular employment.	Facts

Sh.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ranjit Kumar and Sh.	Arguments of Petitioner
Parag P. Tripathi, learned senior counsel for the appellant submit that the CGIT in its award dated 16 th September, 2009 has not only extensively considered the oral and documentary evidence placed on record but also took note of the judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others(supra) and being the appropriate industrial adjudicator, after going into merits and the evidence led by the respective parties to the contract between management SAIL and contractors, arrived to the conclusion that the contract was genuine and not sham and bogus under its award dated 16 th September, 2009 and the finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal has attained finality and unless the approach of the Tribunal was wholly perverse in the sense that the Tribunal has acted on no evidence, it was not justified for the High Court to interfere over the award of the industrial adjudicator sitting as a Court of First Appeal to reappreciate the evidence and even if on the basis of the material on record, two views are possible and one view has been expressed by the Tribunal it was not open for the High Court to substitute its view under the limited scope of judicial review under Sections 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the given circumstances, the finding of fact which has been reversed by the High Court under its impugned judgment holding the contract is not genuine but a mere camouflage, is legally not sustainable and deserves to be interfered by this Court.20.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel further submits that normally the industrial adjudicator is the final Court of facts and on its extensive discussion based on the material available on record, it was held that there is no employer and employee relationship between the appellant and respondent workmen and, therefore, the question of compliance of Section 25(n) of the Act does not arise and it was the contractor who had terminated their services in April 1996 and it was the contractor who had full control and supervision over the work of the labourers.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has also concluded after examining the witness and appraisal of the documentary evidence on record that the wage slips and identity cards were issued to them by the respective contractors and it were the contractors who paid wages to the contract labour and few of the witnesses have also supported payment through contractors.21.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, the conclusion which has been arrived at by the Tribunal that the contractors were exercising exclusive control over the contract labours and tools and equipment were supplied by the contractors as per the terms of the contract and payment was made by respective contractors to the contract labourers and not by the principal employer and it was the contractors who terminated the services of the contract labourers because they proceeded on illegal strike in April 1996 and all the agreements between the management and the contractors entered into are of prior to the notification dated 17 th March, 1993 prohibiting employment of contract labour and subsequently it was only extended by the competent authority from time to time until the services of the contract labour were terminated, holding disciplinary powers against the contract labour being supported by the cogent evidence on record was not open for the High Court to sit as a Court of Appeal and reappraised the evidence under its impugned judgment.22.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Dena Nath and Others Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
National Fertilisers Ltd. and Others 1992(1)	Arguments of Petitioner
SCC 695 and submits that mere violation of the prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act would not entail absorption of the contract labour and at the best could be considered as further continuation to be illegal resulting in penal consequences envisaged under Section 23 to 25 of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra, Sh.	Arguments of Respondent
Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, while supporting the finding recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment further submits that the Tribunal has committed a manifest error in not appreciating the documentary oral evidence on record and thus on reappraisal of the evidence, the High Court was convinced that the finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal under its award dated 16 th September, 2009, being perverse, based on no evidence, has rightly interfered and recorded a finding that the contract was sham and bogus and in consequence thereof in terms of the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court, the workmen became employee of the principal employer (SAIL) in the instant case and entitled for the wages payable to the regular employee of the appellant SAIL and be considered for regularisation of service.24.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel further submits that the employees are entitled for the back wages which has been wrongly denied by the High Court without any justiciable reasons and as they are contesting their claim immediately after their services were terminated, the delay in fact has caused because of 34 rounds of litigation and was also due to the fact that earlier it was held by this Court in Air India Statutory Corporation and Others case (supra) that immediately on the issuance of a prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, the contract labour become entitled for automatic absorption in the establishment wherein he was working prior to passing of the notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, which has been although overruled by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others(supra) at a later point of time but at least there are no latches on the part of the employees and they are entitled for wages for the period they have worked and discharged their duties in the establishment of SAIL and denial of their actual wages by the High Court in the impugned judgment is legally not sustainable.25.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel further submits that High Court has taken note of various tests for determining nature of contract which has been laid down from time to time by the judicial pronouncements i.e. supervision and control, effective and absolute control, disciplinary action, payment of wages etc., the primary tests as the determining factor in arriving to a conclusion as to whether any contract entered in contradistinction to the tests laid down, if any, between the contractor and the contract labour that indeed is sham and bogus.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court on appraisal of the evidence recorded its satisfaction on all the tests cumulatively and rightly held that the contract between the contract labour and the contractor was sham and bogus and once the finding has been recorded under the impugned judgment, the consequence is restoring the relationship of the principal employer and of contract labour as an employer and employee and this makes the respondent entitled for their regularisation of service and the difference of salary which has been paid to their counterparts who were regular in employment of the appellant establishment which indeed could not have been denied to the respondent.	Arguments of Respondent
In the given facts and circumstances, no error has been committed by the High Court in the impugned judgment which may call for any interference.26.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel for the respondent contended that the judgment in Dena Nath and Others (supra) is not applicable for the reason that it was of much prior to the Constitution Bench Judgment of this Court and it has no application for the further reason that it was a case where the effect of failure of compliance of Section 7 and 12 of the CLRA Act was a question and there was no such prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act which came into consideration.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, what has been expressed by this Court may not be of any assistance to the appellant.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the rival submissions made by the parties and with their assistance perused the materials available on record.	None
Before we proceed to examine the question raised in the instant appeals any further, it may be apposite to take note of the indisputed facts which has come on record and take a note of the facts recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment.	None
It is not disputed that the appellant SAIL is a Government of India undertaking and a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and has its steel plants in the different parts of India.	None
SAIL has one of the captive lime stone and dolomite mines in Kuteshwar in the District of Katni of Madhya Pradesh.	Facts
Limestone and Dolomite are necessary ingredients for manufacture of steel.	Facts
The SAIL did blasting work as this work had been departmentalised by Notification dated 15 th December, 1979 w.e.f. 22 nd June, 1980 and various tripartite agreements were executed between the principal employer(SAIL), contractor and contract labour and from time to time wages to which the contract labour was entitled for in terms of tripartite agreement which indisputedly was higher in comparison to the minimum wages notified by the appropriate Government from time to time under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 was paid to each of the contract labour who had worked in the establishment of the appellant.	None
It is also not disputed that the contract labour which is represented through union had worked in the schedule work which has been prohibited by the appropriate Government under its notification issued under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, dated 17 th March, 1993 and there is no challenge to the prohibition notification dated 17 th March, 1993 at least in the instant proceedings.	None
After 34 rounds of litigation, a reference was made by the Government of India, Ministry of Labour vide its notification dated 27 th January, 2003 followed by 22 nd February, 2005 wherein respective claims with supporting oral and documentary evidence were placed by the contesting parties.	None
CGIT under its award dated 16 th September, 2009 recorded a finding of fact holding that the contract was not sham and bogus and if, at all, there was any violation in continuation of the contract labour after issuance of the prohibition notification dated 17 th March, 1973 that entail penal consequences as referred to under Sections 23 to 25 of the CLRA Act and further held that the respondent workmen were not entitled for reinstatement and answered the reference accordingly under its award dated 16 th September, 2009.	None
The finding of fact in return came to be overturned by the High Court in its limited scope of judicial review under Article 226 227 of the Constitution of India under the impugned judgment dated 6 th September, 2010.	None
Before we may advert to examine the question in the instant appeals any further, it will be apposite to take note of the legal effect of the prohibition notification issued by the appropriate Government in exercise of power under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act and its exposition by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others (supra) overruling the judgment in Air India Statutory Corporation and Others (supra).	None
The legal consequence of Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, has been noticed in paragraph 68, 88, 105 and 125 as follows We have extracted above Section 10 of the CLRA Act which empowers the appropriate Government to prohibit employment of contract labour in any process, operation or other work in any establishment, lays down the procedure and specifies the relevant factors which shall be taken into consideration for issuing notification under subsection (1) of Section 10.	None
It is a common ground that the consequence of prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, prohibiting employment of contract labour, is neither spelt out in Section 10 nor indicated anywhere in the Act.	None
In our view, the following consequences follow on issuing a notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act(1) contract labour working in the establishment concerned at the time of issue of notification will cease to function(2)	None
the contract of principal employer with the contractor in regard to the contract labour comes to an end(3) no contract labour can be employed by the principal employer in any process, operation or other work in the establishment to which the notification relates at any time thereafter(4)	None
the contract labour is not rendered unemployed as is generally assumed but continues in the employment of the contractor as the notification does not sever the relationship of master and servant between the contractor and the contract labour(5)	None
the contractor can utilise the services of the contract labour in any other establishment in respect of which no notification under Section 10(1) has been issued where all the benefits under the CLRA Act which were being enjoyed by it, will be available(6) if a contractor intends to retrench his contract labour, he can do so only in conformity with the provisions of the ID Act.	None
The point now under consideration is whether automatic absorption of contract labour working in an establishment, is implied in Section 10 of the CLRA Act and follows as a consequence on issuance of the prohibition notification thereunder.	Issue
We shall revert to this aspect shortly.88.	None
If we may say so, the eloquence of the CLRA Act in not spelling out the consequence of abolition of contract labour system, discerned in the light of various reports of the Commissions and the Committees and the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act, appears to be that Parliament intended to create a bar on engaging contract labour in the establishment covered by the prohibition notification, by a principal employer so as to leave no option with him except to employ the workers as regular employees directly.	Facts
Section 10 is intended to work as a permanent solution to the problem rather than to provide a one time measure by departmentalizing the existing contract labour who may, by a fortuitous circumstance be in a given establishment for a very short time as on the date of the prohibition notification.	None
It could as well be that a contractor and his contract labour who were with an establishment for a number of years were changed just before the issuance of prohibition notification.	None
In such a case there could be no justification to prefer the contract labour engaged on the relevant date over the contract labour employed for a longer period earlier.	None
These may be some of the reasons as to why no specific provision is made for automatic absorption of contract labour in the CLRA Act.105.	None
The principle that a beneficial legislation needs to be construed liberally in favour of the class for whose benefit it is intended, does not extend to reading in the provisions of the Act what the legislature has not provided whether expressly or by necessary implication, or substituting remedy or benefits for that provided by the legislature.	None
We have already noticed above the intendment of the CLRA Act that it regulates the conditions of service of the contract labour and authorizes in Section 10(1) prohibition of contract labour system by the appropriate Government on consideration of factors enumerated in subsection (2) of Section 10 of the Act among other relevant factors.	None
But, the presence of some or all those factors, in our view, provides no ground for absorption of contract labour on issuing notification under subsection (1) of Section 10.	None
Admittedly, when the concept of automatic absorption of contract labour as a consequence of issuing notification under Section 10(1) by the appropriate Government, is not alluded to either in Section 10 or at any other place in the Act and the consequence of violation of Sections 7 and 12 of the CLRA Act is explicitly provided in Sections 23 and 25 of the CLRA Act, it is not for the High Courts or this Court to read in some unspecified remedy in Section 10 or substitute for penal consequences specified in Sections 23 and 25 a different sequel, be it absorption of contract labour in the establishment of principal employer or a lesser or a harsher punishment.	Reasoning
Such an interpretation of the provisions of the statute will be far beyond the principle of ironing out the creases and the scope of interpretative legislation and as such, clearly impermissible.	None
We have already held above, on consideration of various aspects, that it is difficult to accept that Parliament intended absorption of contract labour on issue of abolition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act.125.The upshot of the above discussion is outlined thus(1)(a)	None
Before 2811986, the determination of the question whether the Central Government or the State Government is the appropriate Government in relation to an establishment, will depend, in view of the definition of the expression ?	None
appropriate Government?	None
as stood in the CLRA Act, on the answer to a further question, is the industry under consideration carried on by or under the authority of the Central Government or does it pertain to any specified controlled industry, or the establishment of any railway, cantonment board, major port, mine or oilfield or the establishment of banking or insurance company?	None
If the answer is in the affirmative, the Central Government will be the appropriate Government otherwise in relation to any other establishment the Government of the State in which the establishment was situated, would be the appropriate Government(b)	None
After the said date in view of the new definition of that expression, the answer to the question referred to above, has to be found in clause (a) of Section 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act if (i) the Central Government company undertaking concerned or any undertaking concerned is included therein eo nomine, or (ii) any industry is carried on (a) by or under the authority of the Central Government, or (b) by a railway company or(c) by a specified controlled industry, then the Central Government will be the appropriate Government otherwise in relation to any other establishment, the Government of the State in which that other establishment is situated, will be the appropriate Government.(2)(a)	None
A notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act prohibiting employment of contract labour in any process, operation or other work in any establishment has to be issued by the appropriate Government(1) after consulting with the Central Advisory Board or the State Advisory Board, as the case may be, and(2) having regard to(i) conditions of work and benefits provided for the contract labour in the establishment in question, and(ii) other relevant factors including those mentioned in subsection (2) of Section 10(b)	Facts
Inasmuch as the impugned notification issued by the Central Government on 9121976 does not satisfy the aforesaid requirements of Section 10, it is quashed but we do so prospectively i.e. from the date of this judgment and subject to the clarification that on the basis of this judgment no order passed or no action taken giving effect to the said notification on or before the date of this judgment, shall be called in question in any tribunal or court including a High Court if it has otherwise attained finality and or it has been implemented.(3) Neither Section 10 of the CLRA Act nor any other provision in the Act, whether expressly or by necessary implication, provides for automatic absorption of contract labour on issuing a notification by the appropriate Government under subsection (1) of Section 10, prohibiting employment of contract labour, in any process, operation or other work in any establishment.	Facts
Consequently the principal employer cannot be required to order absorption of the contract labour working in the establishment concerned.(4)	None
We overrule the judgment of this Court in Air India case (1997) 9 SCC 377 prospectively and declare that any direction issued by any industrial adjudicator any court including the High Court, for absorption of contract labour following the judgment in Air India case (1997) 9 SCC 377 shall hold good and that the same shall not be set aside, altered or modified on the basis of this judgment in cases where such a direction has been given effect to and it has become final.(5)	None
On issuance of prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act prohibiting employment of contract labour or otherwise, in an industrial dispute brought before it by any contract labour in regard to conditions of service, the industrial adjudicator will have to consider the question whether the contractor has been interposed either on the ground of having undertaken to produce any given result for the establishment or for supply of contract labour for work of the establishment under a genuine contract or is a mere ruse camouflage to evade compliance with various beneficial legislations so as to deprive the workers of the benefit thereunder.	Reasoning
If the contract is found to be not genuine but a mere camouflage, the socalled contract labour will have to be treated as employees of the principal employer who shall be directed to regularise the services of the contract labour in the establishment concerned subject to the conditions as may be specified by it for that purpose in the light of para 6 hereunder.(6) If the contract is found to be genuine and prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act in respect of the establishment concerned has been issued by the appropriate Government, prohibiting employment of contract labour in any process, operation or other work of any establishment and where in such process, operation or other work of the establishment the principal employer intends to employ regular workmen, he shall give preference to the erstwhile contract labour, if otherwise found suitable and, if necessary, by relaxing the condition as to maximum age appropriately, taking into consideration the age of the workers at the time of their initial employment by the contractor and also relaxing the condition as to academic qualifications other than technical qualifications.?	Reasoning
The exposition of the judgment of the Constitution Bench of this Court made it clear that neither Section 10 nor any other provision in the CLRA Act provides for automatic absorption of contract labour on issuing a notification by the appropriate Government under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, and consequently the principal employer is not required or is under legal obligation by operation of law to absorb the contract labour working in the establishment.34.	Reasoning
This court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others (supra) further held that on a issuance of notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, prohibiting employment of contract labour in any process, operation or other work, if an industrial dispute is raised by any contract labour in regard to condition of service, it is for the industrial adjudicator to consider whether the contractor has been interposed either on the ground of having undertaken to produce any given result for the establishment or for supply of contract labour for work of the establishment under a genuine contract, or as a mere ruse camouflage to evade compliance with various beneficial legislations so as to deprive the workers of statutory benefits.	Reasoning
If the contract is found to be sham, nominal or camouflage, then the socalled labour will have to be treated as direct employee of the principal employer and the industrial adjudicator should direct the principal employer to regularise their services in the establishment subject to such conditions as it may specify for that purpose in the facts and circumstances of the case.35.	Reasoning
On the other hand, if the contract is found to be genuine and a prohibition notification has been issued under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act, in respect of the establishment, the principal employer intending to employ regular workmen for the process, operation or other work of the establishment in regard to which the prohibition notification has been issued, it shall give preference to the erstwhile contract labour if otherwise found suitable, if necessary by giving relaxation of age as it appears to be in fulfilment of the mandate of Section 25(H) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.	Reasoning
It may be noted that the learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance on the judgments of this Court in Silver Jubilee Tailoring House and Others Vs.	None

Tests which are to be applied to find out whether the person is an employee or an independent contractor in finding out whether the contract labour agreement is sham, nominal or a mere camouflage has been examined by this Court in International Airport Authority of India Vs.	None
International Air Cargo Workers?	None
Union and Another 2009 (13) SCC 374 by the twojudge Bench of this Court.	None
The relevant paras are as under ?38.	None
The tests that are applied to find out whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor may not automatically apply in finding out whether the contract labour agreement is a sham, nominal and is a mere camouflage.	None
For example, if the contract is for supply of labour, necessarily, the labour supplied by the contractor will work under the directions, supervision and control of the principal employer but that would not make the worker a direct employee of the principal employer, if the salary is paid by a contractor, if the right to regulate the employment is with the contractor, and the ultimate supervision and control lies with the contractor.39.	None
The principal employer only controls and directs the work to be done by a contract labour, when such labour is assigned allotted sent to him.	None
But it is the contractor as employer, who chooses whether the worker is to be assigned allotted to the principal employer or used otherwise.	None
In short, worker being the employee of the contractor, the ultimate supervision and control lies with the contractor as he decides where the employee will work and how long he will work and subject to what conditions.	None
Only when the contractor assigns sends the worker to work under the principal employer, the worker works under the supervision and control of the principal employer but that is secondary control.	None
The primary control is with the contractor.?	None
These are the broad tests which have been laid down by this Court in examining the nature and control of the employer and whether the agreement pursuant to which contract labour has been engaged through contractor can be said to be sham, nominal and camouflage.39.	None
It was not disputed in the instant case that the contract labourer who were working under a tripartite agreement were allowed to continue under the selfsame agreement executed prior to the prohibition notification dated 17 th March, 1993 and extended from time to time by the competent authority even after issuance of the prohibition notification and the services of the contract workers were terminated by the contractor through whom they were engaged after they proceeded on strike in April, 1996.40.	Reasoning
The Tribunal in its award dated 16 th September, 2009 has recorded a finding of fact based on oral and documentary evidence placed by the respective parties on record in reference to the fact whether the contract was sham and bogus which was a primary cause of adjudication and it was observed that the contractors employed the contract labour on their own and they were the appointing authority.	Reasoning
Witnesses Mangal and Kodulal (contract labourer) were examined and in their crossexamination they have stated that before the issuance of notification dated 17 th March, 1993, they were workers of the contractor and payment was made to them by the contractors, wage slips also show that the wages were being paid by the contractors.	Reasoning
Other witnesses also in crossexamination have supported that half of the PF amount of the workers were deposited by their respective contractors.	Reasoning
Exh. W/39	Reasoning
to W/54 submitted by the contract labours are the photocopies of the identity cards, pay slips, PF slips etc.	Reasoning
These pay slips and identity cards do not show that all 3079 workers were working after the notification dated 17 th March, 1993 without break because number of these documents are of prior to the notification.	Reasoning
It further observed that all the agreements between the management and the contractors are entered into prior to the notification dated 17 th March, 1993 prohibiting employment of contract labour and only extended thereafter from time to time.	Reasoning
It goes to show that there was no fresh contract thereafter ever entered between the parties.	Reasoning
Exh. M/8 filed in R721/05 and the evidence of the witnesses shows that the contractor had terminated the services of the contract labour in April 1996 and transferred some of the contract labourers from the place of work and was the disciplinary authority.41.	Reasoning
It was further observed that the contractors had full control over the skilled and professional work and the SAIL had right to reject the limestone, if it was not within the specified approved grade as per terms and conditions of the agreement and after extensive appreciation of the oral documentary evidence on record, CGIT recorded a finding of fact holding that the contract was not sham and bogus at least up to the date of issuance of the prohibition notification dated 17 th March, 1993.	Reasoning
Although in paragraph 85 of the award the Tribunal has recorded a finding that after the issuance of prohibition notification dated 17 th March, 1993 by operation of law, it became sham and bogus but in our considered view, such a finding recorded in para 85 of the Award dated 16 th September, 2009 is not sustainable in law for the simple reason that mere issuance of the prohibition notification under CLRA Act will not make the contract agreement to be void ab initio or bad in law and if the employees are allowed to continue in terms of the earlier agreement after the prohibition notification under CLRA Act has come into force, it may be illegal and continuance of service in the absence of any contract which stands extinguished by virtue of prohibition notification has to face the penal consequences as embedded under the scheme of CLRA Act.42.	Reasoning
The High Court has taken note of the various provisions of Mines Creche Rules, 1966, Maternity Benefits Act, Mines Act, 1952 and Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961 and other statutory measures which are applicable over the establishment of the appellant including various welfare schemes which provide safety and security of the workers.	Reasoning
To say so, every establishment is under obligation to implement the mandate of law but that could not be a determining factor denominator to test the contract agreement entered between the parties in arriving to a conclusion that such an agreement is sham, nominal or camouflage as held by the High Court in its impugned judgment.43.	Reasoning
The High Court appears to be primarily persuaded with the issuance of a prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act as one of the salient factor to indicate that the committee constituted under the Act, after examining various factors including perennial nature of work, under the CLRA Act has recommended for abolition of contract labour and accepted by the Central Government coupled with the continuation of employment of contract labour after issuance of the prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act in holding that the action of the establishment was opposed to the public policy principles enshrined under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act and taking work from the contract labour was in violation of the statutory notification dated 17 th March, 1993 and that appears to be the reason which persuaded to hold that the finding recorded by the Tribunal that contractors had full control and supervision over the work in view of the functioning of the scheme of mines was unsustainable, instead holding the total control and supervision was that of management of the appellant and the contract was sham and bogus and also the fact that in all the agreements executed between the parties, there was a provision of abolition of contract labour in the matter of work of a perennial in nature and certain other conditions of agreement in recording its satisfaction that the contract was sham and bogus.44.	Reasoning
In our considered view, the finding recorded by the High Court under the impugned judgment is not sustainable for the reason that effect of the prohibition notification under Section 10(1) of CLRA Act has been settled by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Steel Authority of India Ltd. and Others (supra) and this Court has made it clear that neither Section 10 nor any provision in the CLRA Act provides for automatic absorption of contract labour on issuance of prohibition notification by the appropriate Government under Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act and the Tribunal in the first place being the fact finding authority has extensively examined the documentary and oral evidence which came on record and also the relationship of principal employer, contractor and contract labour and the fact that their services were terminated by the contractor after the contract labour proceeded on a strike in April 1996.45.	Reasoning
The Tribunal also considered various other factors in extenso regarding the wage slips, identity cards and the nature of work being discharged by the contract labour subsequent to the prohibition notification dated 17 th March, 1993 and other documentary evidence which came on record and recorded the finding in return that the contract between the contractor and the employee was not sham and bogus and the workmen were not entitled for their absorption in service of the principal employer.46.	Reasoning
To test it further, apart from the statutory compliance which every principal establishment is under an obligation to comply with, its noncompliance or breach may at best entail in penal consequences which is always for the safety and security of the employee workmen which has been hired for discharge of the nature of job in a particular establishment.	Reasoning
The exposition of law has been further considered in International Airport Authority of India case(supra) where the contract was to supply of labour and necessary labour was supplied by the contractor who worked under the directions, supervision and control of the principal employer, that in itself will not in any manner construe the contract entered between the contractor and contract labour to be sham and bogus per se.47.	Reasoning
Thus, in our considered view, if the scheme of the CLRA Act and other legislative enactments which the principal establishment has to comply with under the mandate of law and taking note of the oral and documentary evidence which came on record, the finding which has been recorded by the CGIT under its award dated 16 th September, 2009 in absence of the finding of fact recorded being perverse or being of no evidence and even if there are two views which could possibly be arrived at, the view expressed by the Tribunal ordinarily was not open to be interfered with by the High Court under its limited scope of judicial review under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India and this exposition has been settled by this Court in its various judicial precedents.48.	Reasoning
It is true that judgment in Dena Nath and Others (supra) is in reference to failure of compliance of Section 7 and 12 and not in reference to Section 10(1) of the CLRA Act but if we look into the scheme of CLRA Act which is a complete code in itself, noncompliance or violation or breach of the provisions of the CLRA Act, it result into penal consequences as has been referred to in Sections 23 to 25 of the Act and there is no provision which would entail any other consequence other than provided under Section 23 to 25 of the Act.49.	Reasoning
In our considered view, the Tribunal under its award dated 16 th September, 2009 has rightly arrived to the conclusion that the contract was not sham and bogus and there shall be no automatic absorption of contract labour on issuance of a prohibition notification under the CLRA Act and the High Court of Madhya Pradesh has committed a manifest error in reversing the finding of fact in return under its impugned judgment dated 6 th September, 2010 which, in our view, is not sustainable and deserves to be set aside.	Reasoning
The appeals are accordingly disposed of and the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 6 th September, 2010 is hereby set aside.	Decision
The respondent is at liberty to avail remedy for alleged breach of the provisions of the CLRA Act, if so advised, in accordance with law.	Decision
No costs.51.	Decision
Pending application(s), if any, also stand disposed of	Decision
