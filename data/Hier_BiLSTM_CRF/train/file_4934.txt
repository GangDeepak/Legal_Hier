In all these appeals, question of law that needs to be decided is identical, which was the reason for clubbing these appeals and hearing them analogously.	None
However, for the sake of convenience, we would be taking note of facts from Civil Appeal Nos. 1304713048 of 2017, as that would serve the purpose.	None
2.	None
The Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the assessee) is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling polymers and chemicals.	Facts
These goods are manufactured by the Respondent in its factory situated in the State of Gujarat (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant State).	Facts
After the manufacture of these goods, same are transferred by the Assessee to its various branches located in different parts of the country from where those goods are sold.	Facts
Obviously, in respect of goods transferred to places outside the Appellant State, the Value Added Tax (VAT) is paid at the time of sale of those goods in those States, as per the local laws of the said States.	Facts
The goods are sold in the Appellant State as well and in respect of these goods VAT is paid as per the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (for short, the VAT Act).	Facts
For the purpose of manufacturing the aforesaid goods, namely, polymers and chemicals, the Assessee purchases furnace oil, natural gas and light diesel oil (hereinafter referred to as the raw material or inputs) from its registered dealers.	Facts
These fuels are used for the aforesaid manufacturing activities.	Facts
On purchase of the raw material, VAT is paid at varying rates.	Facts
On furnace oil, 4 VAT is payable as per the VAT Act, whereas on natural gas and light diesel oil rate of VAT prescribed and payable is 12.5.	Facts
Since these inputs are used for manufacturing of the final products, there is a provision in the VAT Act for giving credit on the VAT which is paid at the time of purchase of these inputs.	Facts
The manner in which this credit is to be given is prescribed Under Section 11 of the VAT Act.	Facts
Section 11 reads as under 11.	None

3.	None
A birds eye view of the relevant portion of the aforesaid provision, which is the subject matter of these appeals, reveals that the tax credit which is admissible to the purchasing dealer is subject to provisions of Subsection (2) of Section 12.	Reasoning
Subsection (3)(b), with which we are primarily concerned, provides that if the goods are falling in the categories mentioned in Subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the tax credit is to be reduced by the amount of tax calculated at the rate of 4 on the taxable turnover of purchases within the State.	Reasoning
As noted above, the raw material inputs used in the instant goods are fuels.	Reasoning
Subclause (ii) includes such goods in case the taxable goods are dispatched outside the State in the course of branch transfer.	Reasoning
As already mentioned above, after the final product is produced, the Assessee transfers these goods to its various branch offices, many of which are located outside the State and, therefore, those goods which are so transferred would be covered by this Subclause and in respect of such goods which are transferred outside the State and are taxable under the VAT Act, the tax credit is to be reduced by 4.	Reasoning
Since the raw material in the instant goods is in the nature of fuels used for the manufacture of goods, it gets covered by Subclause (iii) as well.	Reasoning
The issue that needs to be decided is as to whether the tax credit is to be reduced at the rate of 4 under Subclause (ii) and again at the same rate under Subclause (iii) as well or deduction permissible is only once.	Issue
4. The Assessing Officer had held that in respect of such goods tax credit is required to be reduced at the rate of 4 under Subclause (ii) and again at the rate of 4 under Subclause (iii).	Facts
This order was upheld by the Joint Commissioner of Commercial Taxes in appeal that was preferred by the Assessee.	Facts
However, in further appeal before the Gujarat Value Added Tax Tribunal, the aforesaid view was upset as the Tribunal held that the deduction can be at 4 only and there cannot be double reduction in tax credit admissible to the Assessee.	Facts
The High Court has put its stamp of approval to the aforesaid view of the VAT Tribunal.	Facts
That is the reason for the Appellant State to approach this Court as it is obviously not satisfied with the decision of the High Court.	Facts
5. Reasons given by the High Court in taking the aforesaid view can be captured from the following discussion contained in the impugned judgment It is not in dispute that in the present case, the taxable goods purchased by the Respondent Assessee satisfy the description of Subclause (ii) and (iii) of Section 11(3)(b).	Facts
Despite this, in our view, the Tribunal came to a correct conclusion that denial of tax credit by 4 per cent as provided in Clause (b) would have to be done only once.	Facts
We say so for several reasons.	Facts
Firstly, Clause (b) of Section 11(3) pertains to reduction of tax credit otherwise available Under Section 11.	Facts
Such reduction is to be applied if the goods satisfy the descriptions contained in Subclause (i) to (iii) thereof.	Facts
After Clause (i), the Legislature has used the word or.	Facts
We are conscious that at end of Clause (ii) and beginning of Clause (iii), the Legislature has not once again used the word or, but has also not added the expression and.	Facts
Plain reading of the said provisions thus makes it clear that the reduction of tax credit had to be applied to any case which satisfy the description contained in Subclauses (i) to (iii) not every time such description is satisfied.	Facts
Further, reduction of amount of tax at the rate of 4 per cent is to be done for the taxable goods which fall in any of the three categories contained in Subclauses (i) to (iii) and not every time a particular class of goods specified fall in more than one categories.	Facts
6.	None
In addition, the High Court has also observed that the legislative intent of Section 11(3)(b) can be gathered from proviso thereto which provides that where the rate of tax of taxable goods is less than 4, then the amount of tax credit in respect of such dealer shall be reduced by the amount of tax calculated at the rate of tax set out in the Schedule of such goods, meaning thereby, if the tax credit available to a dealer is less than 4, the reduction should be limited to such credit and no more.	Facts
From this, the High Court has observed that the Legislature envisaged that in no case reduction of tax credit Under Section 11(3)(b) would accede 4. 7.	Facts
Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India, and Mr. S.K. Bagaria, learned senior Counsel, argued the matter on behalf of the Appellant State and response thereto was given by Mr. Arvind Datar, learned senior advocate appearing for the Respondent in Civil Appeal Nos. 1304713048 of 2017.	None
Advocates appearing for the Respondents in other appeals supported Mr. Datar.	None
8.	None
It was argued by Mr. Venugopal and Mr. Bagaria that the approach of the High Court was clearly erroneous as liberal interpretation of Section 11(3)(b), when read in the context of the entire scheme of tax credit and other provisions, would clearly show that it was intended to reduce the amount of tax credit by 4 in an eventuality when case was covered under Subclause (ii) and again at the rate of 4 when the matter was covered by Subclause (iii).	Arguments of Petitioner
It was argued that in tax matters, where the language of the statute is plain and clear, effect thereto has to be given and equity does not play any role in these cases.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further argued that as per the provisions of the VAT Act, VAT was payable on the purchase of furnace oil, natural gas and light diesel oil as well.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, the Legislature intended to give tax credit in respect of these items when such items are used as raw material inputs for the purpose of manufacturing other products.	Arguments of Petitioner
At the same time, it is the prerogative of the law makers to decide how and under what circumstances such tax credit would be admissible and to what extent.	Arguments of Petitioner
But for such a provision, the Assessee did not have any right to claim tax credit and thus the question of double deduction does not arise at all.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also argued that Subclause (ii) as well as Subclause (iii) are attracted in different circumstances and, therefore, the reduction stipulated therein could not be treated as double taxation.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Counsel proceeded to argue that insofar as Subclause (ii) is concerned, it would be attracted on satisfying the twin conditions, namely (a) when taxable goods are used as raw material in the manufacture or in the packing of goods and (b) these goods are dispatched outside the State in the course of branch transfer or consignment or to the agent of the manufacturer outside the State.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Subclause (iii) was attracted in those cases where fuel is used for the manufacture of goods.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is possible, in a given case, that both Subclauses (ii) and (iii) become applicable (as it has happened in the instant case).	Arguments of Petitioner
However, in such cases the Legislature clearly intended that reduction at the rate of 4 has to be applied in each of the circumstances.	Arguments of Petitioner
Number of judgments were cited on interpretation of tax statutes as well as the manner in which punctuation marks are to be interpreted.	Arguments of Petitioner
9.	None
Mr. Datar conceded to the extent that the Legislature was empowered to frame a particular scheme of giving tax credit and when such a scheme is provided statutorily, that had to be applied and it was not open to the Assessees to claim equities in such matters.	Arguments of Respondent
He also conceded that such taxing statutes are to be given strict interpretation.	Arguments of Respondent
However, he joined issues in the manner in which Section 11(3)(b) is to be interpreted.	Arguments of Respondent
His submission was that the High Court has rightly interpreted the said provision.	Arguments of Respondent
In this behalf, he argued that Section 11(3)(a) makes a provision for giving the credit whereas Clause (b) reduces the said credit to a certain extent in those eventualities which are provided therein.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 11(5) totally disallows the tax credit in the circumstances provided in Clauses (a) to (p) thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
He specifically referred to Clauses (h) and (I) of Subsection (5) to buttress his submission that on those goods which are exempted from the whole of the tax by a notification Under Subsection (2) of Section 5 etc.	Arguments of Respondent
no tax credit in that behalf is provided.	Arguments of Respondent
Likewise, on the goods which are used as fuel in generation of electrical energy meant for captive use or otherwise (subclause (i)), no tax credit is allowed.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, if one keeps in mind this scheme of giving tax credit, the intention is clear, namely, the reduction rate cannot be more than the tax credit allowed.	Arguments of Respondent
Pointing out that in respect of furnace oil VAT is payable at 4 and if the contention of the Appellant State is accepted, deduction there on will be at the rate of 8 (4 under Subclause (ii) and 4 under Subclause (iii))	Arguments of Respondent
and it would result in an anomalous position as tax credit earned on the said furnace oil, when used as raw material in the production of polymers or chemicals, would be earned at the rate of 4 under Clause (a), the State intended to reduce the same by 8 under Clause (b).	Arguments of Respondent
10.	None
We have examined the respective contentions minutely and carefully and are of the opinion that the view taken by the High Court in the impugned judgment may not be entirely correct.	None
11.	None
Let us take up the provision for interpretation in the first instance.	None
12.	None
Section 11 entails the provision pertaining to the scheme of tax credit, which is the caption of the said Section as well.	None
Subsection (1) thereof mentions the contingencies when a registered dealer would be entitled to claim tax credit which is equal to the amount of tax collected from the dealer by a registered dealer or tax paid by him during the tax period or tax paid by the purchasing dealer under the Gujarat Tax On Entry of Specified Goods into Local Area Act, 2001.	None
In nutshell, Clause (a) of Subsection (1) of Section 11 entitles the registered dealer to claim tax credit of the amount of VAT or entry tax which was paid.	Reasoning
However, this tax credit is subject to Subsections (2) to (12) of Section 11.	Reasoning
In this hue, we have to examine the provisions of Subsection (3) around which the entire case hinges upon.	Issue
13. Clause (a) of SubSection 3 lays down certain conditions which have to be fulfilled in order to claim the tax credit.	Reasoning
First condition is to give the tax credit in those cases where taxable goods are purchased.	Reasoning
Thus, it is not admissible where the purchased goods are nontaxable inasmuch as in those cases no tax was paid and thus the question of giving credit would not arise.	Reasoning
Second condition mentions that these goods are intended for specific purposes which are stipulated in Subclauses (1) to (7) of Clause (a).	Reasoning
A perusal of these subclauses would indicate that contingencies stipulated in Subclauses (i) to (v) pertain to one category, i.e. where the goods are purchased as it is.	Reasoning
On the other hand, Subclauses (vi) and (vii) would fall in other category.	Reasoning
Subclause (vi) deals with a situation where the goods, after purchase, are used as raw material in the manufacture of taxable goods or in the packing of goods so manufactured.	Reasoning
Subclause (vii) deals with those goods which are used as capital goods meant for use in the manufacture of taxable goods.	Reasoning
Subclause (i) of Clause (b) is relatable to Subclause (iii) of Clause (a) as these deal with branch transfer of the goods.	Reasoning
Likewise, Subclause (vi) read with Subclause (iii) of Clause (a) is concerned with Subclause (2) of Clause (b) as these deal with a situation where the goods so produced, in respect of which tax credit is given, are used as raw material in the manufacture or in the packing of goods and there is branch transfer of these goods as well outside the State.	Reasoning
In such eventualities, tax credit is not fully given as it is reduced by 4.	Reasoning
It may also be pointed out at this stage that the term raw materials is defined in Section 2(19) of the VAT Act and reads as under raw materials means goods used as ingredient in the manufacture of other goods and includes processing materials, consumable stores and materials used in the packing of the goods so manufactured but does not include fuels for the purpose of generation of electricity 14.	None
It is clear that the material used even in the packing of goods is treated as raw material and, therefore, this definition is to be treated as term of Article	Reasoning
This definition also clarifies that fuels used in the manufacture of goods would be treated as raw material with the only exception of those fuels which are used for the purpose of generation of electricity.	Reasoning
15.	None
Keeping in mind the aforesaid aspects, we advert to Section 11(3)(b).	Issue
It is a nonobstante Clause as it starts with the word notwithstanding.	None
Another aspect which is to be necessarily kept in mind is that it is the amount of tax credit which a dealer would be entitled to claim under Clause (a) that is to be reduced at the rate of 4 and this reduction is to be effected in three eventualities provided under Subclauses (i), (ii) and (iii).	Reasoning
Insofar as Subclause (i) is concerned, it pertains to trading activity and there is no question of any overlap between Subclause (i) on the one hand and Subclauses (ii) and (iii) on the other.	Reasoning
Further, insofar as Subclauses (i) and (ii) are concerned, same are disjunctive as the word or is inserted between these two clauses.	Reasoning
However, when we come to Clauses (ii) and (iii), where there is a possibility of overlap (as it has happened in the instant case as well), there is no word or used between Clauses (ii) and (iii).	Reasoning
Subclause (ii) finishes with the punctuation mark full stop and then Subclause (iii) starts.	Reasoning
This depicts the intention of the Legislature, namely, reduction is not confined to one of the aforesaid two subclauses and it can occur under both these provisions.	Reasoning
It is rightly pointed out by the Appellant State that these are event based subclauses and two events are totally different.	Reasoning
Subclause (ii) is attracted in those cases where taxable goods are used as raw material (which may not necessarily be fuel but all raw materials are included) and also the other condition which is to be fulfilled is that these goods are dispatched outside the State in the course of branch transfer etc.	Reasoning
Therefore, even if the taxable goods are used as raw material in the manufacture or in the packing of goods but they are consumed or sold within the State, Subclause (ii) would not apply.	Reasoning
On the other hand, Subclause (iii) is referable to only fuels which are used for manufacture of goods.	Reasoning
It is, thus, a totally separate category and the moment fuel is used in the manufacture of goods, this Subclause gets attracted and it would be immaterial whether the goods are sold within the State or outside the State.	Reasoning

A Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Rajinder Singh v. Kultar Singh AIR 1980 PH 1 ILR (1979) 2 PH 486 (FB) touching the same topic stated thus (AIR p. 1) So far as the High Courts are concerned, the topic of jurisdiction and powers in general is not separately mentioned in any of the entries of List I, but administration of justice as a distinct topic finds a place in Entry 3 of List II (now Entry 11A of List III).	None
The expression administration of justice occurring in Entry 3 of List II of the VIIth Schedule has to be construed in its widest sense so as to give power to the State Legislature to legislate on all matters relating to administration of justice.	None
After the words administration of justice in Entry 3 there is a semicolon and this punctuation cannot be discarded as being inappropriate.	None
The punctuation has been put with a definite object of making this topic as distinct and not having relation only to the topic that follows thereafter.	None
Under Entry 78 of List I, the topic of jurisdiction and powers of the High Courts is not dealt with.	None
Under Entry 3 of List II the State Legislature can confer jurisdiction and powers or restrict or withdraw the jurisdiction and powers already conferred on any of the courts except the Supreme Court, in respect of any statute.	None
Therefore, the State Legislature has the power to make a law with respect to the jurisdiction and powers of the High Court.	None

In our view the Full Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court was right in giving emphasis and meaning to semicolon in Entry 3 of the list after the words administration of justice in Rajinder Singh.	None

(1999) 4 SCC 192. 18.	Reasoning
The aforesaid discussion leads us to the conclusion that it is a mega tax credit scheme which is provided under the VAT Act meant for all kinds of manufactured goods.	Reasoning
The material in question, namely, furnace oil, natural gas and light diesel oil are admittedly subject to VAT under the VAT Act.	Reasoning
The Legislature, however, has incorporated the provision, in the form of Section 11, to give tax credit in respect of such goods which are used as inputs raw material for manufacturing other goods.	Reasoning
Rationale behind the same is simple.	Reasoning
When the finished product, after manufacture, is sold, VAT would be again payable thereon.	Reasoning
This VAT is payable on the price at which such goods are sold, costing whereof is done keeping in view the expenses involved in the manufacture of such goods plus the profits which the manufacturer intends to earn.	Reasoning
Insofar as costing is concerned, element of expenses incurred on raw material would be included.	Reasoning
In this manner, when the final product is sold and the VAT paid, component of raw material would be included again.	Reasoning
Keeping in view this objective, the Legislature has intended to give tax credit to some extent.	Reasoning
However, how much tax credit is to be given and under what circumstances, is the domain of the Legislature and the courts are not to tinker with the same.	Reasoning
This proposition is authoritatively determined by this Court in series of judgments.	None

(1992) 3 SCC 624 and the relevant extract which is relevant for our purposes is as follows 9.	Reasoning
Sri Bobde appearing for the Appellants reiterated the contentions urged before the High Court.	Reasoning
He submitted that the deduction of one per cent, in effect, amounts to taxing the raw material purchased outside the State or to taxing the sale of finished goods effected outside the State of Maharashtra.	Reasoning
We cannot agree.	Reasoning
Indeed, the whole issue can be put in simpler terms.	Reasoning
The Appellant (manufacturing dealer) purchases his raw material both within the State of Maharashtra and outside the State.	Reasoning
Insofar as the purchases made outside the State of Maharashtra are concerned, the tax thereon is paid to other States.	Reasoning
The State of Maharashtra gets the tax only in respect of purchases made by the Appellant within the State.	Reasoning
So far as the sales tax leviable on the sale of the goods manufactured by the Appellant is concerned, the State of Maharashtra can levy and collect such tax only in respect of sales effected within the State of Maharashtra.	Reasoning
It cannot levy or collect tax in respect of goods which are despatched by the Appellant to his branches and agents outside the State of Maharashtra and sold there.	Reasoning
In law (apart from Rules 41 and 41A) the Appellant has no legal right to claim setoff of the purchase tax paid by him on his purchases within the State from out of the sales tax payable by him on the sale of the goods manufactured by him.	Reasoning
It is only by virtue of the said Rules  which, as stated above, are conceived mainly in the interest of public  that he is entitled to such setoff.	Reasoning
It is really a concession and an indulgence.	Reasoning
More particularly, where the manufactured goods are not sold within the State of Maharashtra but are despatched to outState branches and agents and sold there, no sales tax can be or is levied by the State of Maharashtra.	Reasoning
The State of Maharashtra gets nothing in respect of such sales effected outside the State.	Reasoning
In respect of such sales, the rulemaking authority could well have denied the benefit of setoff.	Reasoning
But it chose to be generous and has extended the said benefit to such outState sales as well, subject, however to deduction of one per cent of the sale price of such goods sent out of the State and sold there.	Reasoning
We fail to understand how a valid grievance can be made in respect of such deduction when the very extension of the benefit of setoff is itself a boon or a concession.	Reasoning
It was open to the rulemaking authority to provide for a small abridgement or curtailment while extending a concession.	Reasoning
Viewed from this angle, the argument that providing for such deduction amounts to levy of tax either on purchases of raw material effected outside the State or on sale of manufactured goods effected outside the State of Maharashtra appears to be beside the point and is unacceptable.	Reasoning
So is the argument about apportioning the saleprice with reference to the proportion in which raw material was purchased within and outside the State.	Reasoning
To the same effect are the judgments in the case of Hotel Balaji and Ors.	Reasoning
v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Ors.	Reasoning
(1993)Supp 4 SCC 536 and Jayam and Company v. Assistant Commissioner and Anr.	Reasoning
(2015) 15 SCC 125.	Reasoning
19.	None
The upshot of the aforesaid discussion would be to hold that reduction of 4 would be applied whenever a case gets covered by Subclause (ii) and again when Subclause (iii) is attracted.	Reasoning
20.	None
This, however, would be subject to one limitation.	Reasoning
In those cases where VAT paid on such raw material is 4, as in the case of furnace oil, reduction cannot be more than that.	Reasoning
After all, Section 11 deals with giving credit in respect of tax that is paid.	Reasoning
Therefore, if some reduction is to be made from the said credit, it cannot be more than the credit given.	Reasoning
Thus, so far as furnace oil is concerned, tax credit shall be reduced by 4.	Decision
On the other hand, tax credit given in case of natural gas and light diesel oil (other fuels), it shall be reduced by 4 under Subclause (ii) and 4 under Subclause (iii) of Clause (b) of Subsection (3) of Section 11.	Decision
21.	None
The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
