 K. SIKRI, J. Prologue All these appeals arise out of the judgment dated August 04, 2016 rendered by the High Court of Delhi in writ petitions filed before it under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.	Facts
We would refer to the subject matter of those writ petitions and the manner in which the High Court dealt with and decided the same at the appropriate stage.	Facts
However, it would be pertinent to point out that in the said impugned judgment, main issue related to the status of National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD) and in, particular, about administration of NCTD, powers exercisable by and functions of the elected Government of NCTD (GNCTD) visavis the Central Government (or to put it more precisely, in juxtaposition to the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of GNCTD, as nominee of the President of India).	Facts
This issue centered around the interpretation that needed to be given to Article 239AA of the Constitution of India.	Facts
Undoubtedly, NCTD was and remains Union Territory and continues to be governed by Part VIII of the Constitution which pertains to the Union Territories.	Facts
Article 239, which substituted the original Article by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, w.e.f., 01 November, 1956 deals with administration of Union Territories.	Facts
As the nomenclature itself suggests, such territories are that of Union , i.e., Union of India.	Facts
That is why Article 239 stipulates that every Union Territory is to be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through an Administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify.	Facts
The opening words of Article 239, however, are save as otherwise provided by Parliament by law, which meas that Parliament by law can provide different schemes of administration for such Union Territories, i.e., different than what is stated in Article 239.	Facts
In the year 1962, Article 239A was inserted, providing a little departure from the Scheme of administration contained in Article 239, insofar as Union Territory of Puducherry is concerned.	Facts
Likewise by the Constitution (Sixty Ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 special provision with respect to Delhi stood incorporated.	Facts
This Article, inter alia, provides for a Legislative Assembly for NCTD, Legislative Assembly which comprises of Members who are elected representatives.	Facts
It means that voters of NCTD elect their representatives to the Legislative Assembly.	Facts
The seminal issue which arose for consideration before the High Court in the writ petitions concerned the powers exercisable by such elected Government and the manner in which NCTD is to be administered.	Facts
As noted above, as per Article 239, it is the President of India which administers a Union Territory and he can do so through an Administrator to be appointed by him with appropriate designation.	Facts
Such a designation generally is that of Administrator or Lieutenant Governor.	Facts
In respect of Delhi, designation bestowed is that of Lieutenant Governor.	Facts
With the aforesaid special provision inculcated by the insertion of Article 239AA and by providing for Legislative Assembly, the moot question arose as to what are the powers of the elected government of Delhi visavis the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.	Facts
To state in a nutshell and in precise manner, the High Court of Delhi held that since NCTD remains a Union Territory, it is the President who continues to administer NCTD as well as Territory of the Union, i.e., the Central Government and his nominee, namely, the Lieutenant Governor enjoys the overlapping powers.	Facts
When these appeals came up before the Division Bench of this Court, the Division Bench found that issues raised are of seminal constitutional importance and needed to be referred to a Constitution Bench in terms of the provisions contained in Clause 5(5) of Article 143 of the Constitution.	Facts
The matters were, accordingly, referred to the Constitution Bench to answer the aforesaid question, namely, ambit and scope of the powers of the GNCTD in juxtaposition to that of the Lieutenant Governor.	Facts
The Constitution Bench has given the answers to the various nuances of the otherwise thorny and ticklish issues, vide its judgment dated July 04, 2018.	Facts
There are three opinions.	Facts
The majority opinion is penned by Justice Dipak Misra, Chief Justice of India (as his Lordship then was) to which Justice Khanwilkar and one of us (Justice A.K. Sikri) concurred.	Facts
Two other separate opinions are rendered by Justice Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud and one of us (Justice Ashok Bhushan).	Facts
After giving answers to the moot questions that arise, all these appeals were directed to be listed before the Regular Bench for deciding the individual issues and disputes that arise in these appeals.	Facts
This is how the matters were heard, on its own merits, depending upon subject matter of each of these appeals, by this Bench.	Facts
We propose to decide these disputes by means of the present judgment.	Facts
Issues At this juncture, we would like to state in brief the precise subject matter of these appeals As pointed out above, Civil Appeal No. 2357 of 2017 arises out of the common judgment dated August 04, 2016 passed by the High Court in a batch of writ petitions.	Facts
In these writ petitions, number of notifications passed by the Government of India, or by the GNCTD were questioned by the writ petitioners.	Facts
Some writ petitions were filed by GNCTD one by Union of India and few others by some individuals.	Facts
The orders and or actions, validity whereof was questioned by the petitioners before the High Court is stated by the High Court in the impugned judgment itself in a tabulated form.	Facts
It would be convenient to reproduce the same as that captures the essence of subject matter of dispute in each of the writ petition.	Facts
table From the above, it can be discerned that following issues arise for consideration The powers of GNCTD visavis Lieutenant Governor in respect of matters connected with services.	Issue
It may be mentioned, at this juncture itself that in Delhi there is no Public Service Commission.	Issue
Since it is the Union Territory, the manpower public servants which are assigned to Delhi are either those who belong to All India Services like Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service etc. or those who are recruited for Union Territories, commonly known as NCT of Delhi, Andaman Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli Civil Service (DHANICS).	Issue
Admittedly these officers public servants do not belong to Union Territory of Delhi exclusively or, for that matter, at all.	Issue
They are placed at the disposal of NCTD by the Central Government.	Issue
To this extent there is no dispute.	Issue
However, bone of contention is about their mobility, i.e. their posting within Delhi itself from one place department to other.	Issue
To put it otherwise, the issue is as to whether such posting orders are to be passed by the President of India (or for that matter the Lieutenant Governor) or it is the Government of NCTD which is competent to exercise such a power once the manpower is assigned to it.	None
Other issue relates to the setting up of AntiCorruption Bureau Police Station (ACB Police Station).	None
Vide Notifications dated May 21, 2015 and July 23, 2014 the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs empowered the Lieutenant Governor to exercise such a power and directed ACB Police Station not to take cognizance of offences against officials of Central Government.	Issue
These Notifications were challenged by the GNCTD on the ground that ACB Police Stations are empowered to take cognizance of offences against officials of the Central Government as well, so long as they are posted in Delhi.	Issue
Another dispute between the GNCTD and the Central Government arises out of Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 (COI Act).	None
It is Whether GNCTD is empowered to set up Commission of Inquiry under the said Act of its own and without placing the matter before the Lieutenant Governor for his views concurrence.	Issue
Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2011 is enacted which is State Legislative.	None
Delhi Electricity Reforms (Transfer Schemes) Rules, 2001 have also been framed under this Act.	Issue
The GNCTD issued orders under the said Act and Rules appointing the nominee Directors on the Board of Electricity Distribution Companies without placing the matter before the Lieutenant Governor for his views concurrence.	Issue
The competence of the GNCTD to pass such executive order is another subject matter of dispute.	None
Another area of conflict is about the appointment of Public Prosecutors under Section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.	None
Issue is as to whether this power lies with the Lieutenant Governor to the exclusion of GNCTD or it is the GNCTD which is competent to appoint Public Prosecutors, including Special Public Prosecutors in individual cases.	Issue
Judgment of the Constitution Bench Before we come to the grip of these issues it would be essential to discuss in brief the provisions of Article 239AA of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Constitution Bench judgment dated July 04, 2018 (hereinafter referred to as CB Judgment).	None
Relevant Articles of the Constitution, which need to be noted amongst others in this behalf, are Articles 239 and 239AA, which read as under Administration of Union territories.	None
Save as otherwise provided by Parliament by law, every Union territory shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify.	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in Part VI, the President may appoint the Governor of a State as the administrator of an adjoining Union territory, and where a Governor is so appointed, he shall exercise his functions as such administrator independently of his Council of Ministers.	None
239AA.	None
Special provisions with respect to Delhi.	None
As from the date of commencement of the Constitution (Sixtyninth Amendment) Act, 1991, the Union territory of Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory of Delhi (hereafter in this Part referred to as the National Capital Territory) and the administrator thereof appointed under Article 239 shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor.

None
(3)(a) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for the whole or any part of the National Capital Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union territories except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List in so far as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18.	Arguments of Respondent
Nothing in subclause (a) shall derogate from the powers of Parliament under this Constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for a Union territory or any part thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
If any provision of a law made by the Legislative Assembly with respect to any matter is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament with respect to that matter, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislative Assembly, or of an earlier law, other than a law made by the Legislative Assembly, then, in either case, the law made by Parliament, or, as the case may be, such earlier law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislative Assembly shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void Provided that if any such law made by the Legislative Assembly has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, such law shall prevail in the National Capital Territory Provided further that nothing in this subclause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislative Assembly.	None
There shall be a Council of Ministers consisting of not more than ten per cent of the total number of members in the Legislative Assembly, with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his functions in relation to matters with respect to which the Legislative Assembly has power to make laws, except in so far as he is, by or under any law, required to act in his discretion Provided that in the case of difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any matter, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the President and pending such decision it shall be competent for the Lieutenant Governor in any case where the matter, in his opinion, is so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, to take such action or to give such direction in the matter as he deems necessary.	None
The Chief Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Chief Minister and the Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.	None

The provisions of Article 239B shall, so far as may be, apply in relation to the National Capital Territory, the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Assembly, as they apply in relation to the Union territory of Puducherry, the administrator and its Legislature, respectively and any reference in that article to clause (1) of Article 239A shall be deemed to be a reference to this article or Article 239AB, as the case may be.	None
As pointed above, the Court in aforesaid Constitution Bench judgment took note of the fact that with insertion of Article 239AA, which gave special status to the Union Territory of Delhi known as National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD), the NCTD has its own Legislative Assembly which is elected body through the election process by the voters of NCTD.	None
The principal question, therefore, was as to whether this amended constitutional provision had transformed the status of Delhi and what is the extent and power which are to be accorded to the Legislative Assembly as well as the Executive as a result of these elections, i.e., Government of NCT of Delhi.	Issue
In the majority opinion, it was emphasised at the beginning itself that while entering into the process of interpretation of Article 239AA of the Constitution, the Court is supposed to take aid of new tools such as constitutional pragmatism having due regard for sanctity of objectivity, realisation of the purpose in truest sense by constantly reminding one and all about the sacrosanctity of democratic structure envisaged by our Constitution, elevation of the precepts of constitutional trust and morality, and the solemn idea of decentralisation of power.	None
This method of understanding is described in the judgment as confluence of the idea and spirit of the Constitution.	None
The court also emphasised that interpretation of Article 239AA of the Constitution is not to be done in an exclusive compartment but in the context in which it has been introduced and also keeping in view the conceptual structure of the other relevant Articles of the Constitution.	None
In this process, the Court recapitulated brief history of Delhi from its inception as Capital of India in the year 1911 upto the stage of insertion of Article 239AA in the Constitution, which was the result of a detailed report submitted by Balakrishnan Committee.	None
This narration in the judgment is as follows On 12121911, Delhi became the capital of India.	None
Delhi Tehsil and Mehrauli Thana were separated from Punjab and annexed to Delhi headed by a Commissioner and it came to be known as the Chief Commissioners province.	None
In 1912, the Delhi Laws Act, 1912 came into force with effect from 1101912 making certain laws prevalent in Punjab to be applicable to Delhi.	None
The Delhi Laws Act, 1915 empowered the Chief Commissioner, Delhi to determine application of laws by issuing appropriate notification in the Gazette of India.	None
The Government of India Act, 1919 and the Government of India Act, 1935 retained Delhi as a Centrally administered territory.	None
On coming into force of the Constitution of India on 2611950, Delhi became a Part C State.	None
In the year 1951, the Government of Part C States Act, 1951 was enacted providing, inter alia, for a Legislative Assembly in Delhi.	None
Section 21(1) of the 1951 Act empowered the Legislative Assembly to make laws on all matters of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution except (i) public order (ii) police (including railway police) (iii) constitution and powers of municipal corporations and local authorities, etc. public utility authorities (iv) lands buildings vested in in possession of the Union situated in Delhi or New Delhi (v) offences against laws about subjects mentioned from (i) to (iv) and (vi) jurisdiction of courts with respect to the above matters and court fee thereon.	None
On 19101956, the Constitution of India (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 was passed to implement the provisions of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 which did away with Part A, B, C and D States and only two categories, namely, States and Union Territories remained and Delhi became a Union Territory to be administered by an Administrator appointed by the President.	None
The Legislative Assembly of Delhi and the Council stood abolished.	None
In the year 1953, the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 was enacted to provide for Legislative Assemblies and Council of Ministers for various Union Territories but the provisions of the said Act were not made applicable to Delhi.	None
The Delhi Administration Act, 1966 was enacted to provide for limited representative Government for Delhi through a Metropolitan Council comprising of 56 elected Members and five nominated Members.	None
In the same year, on 2081966, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued S.O. No. 2524 that provided, inter alia, that the Lieutenant Governor Administrator Chief Commissioner shall be subject to the control of the President of India and exercise such powers and discharge the functions of a State Government under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 within the Union Territories.	None
In the year 1987, the Balakrishnan Committee was set up to submit its recommendations with regard to the status to be conferred on Delhi and the said Committee recommended that Delhi should continue to be a Union Territory but there must be a Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers responsible to the said Assembly with appropriate powers and to ensure stability, appropriate constitutional measures should be taken to confer the National Capital a special status.	None
The relevant portion of the Balakrishnan Committee Report reads as follows 6.5.5.	None
In Paras 6.5.2.	None
and	None
6.5.3.	None
we have briefly summarised the arguments for and against making Delhi a constituent State of the Union.	None
After the most careful consideration of all the arguments and on an objective appraisal, we are fully convinced that most of the arguments against making Delhi a State of the Union are very substantial, sound and valid and deserve acceptance.	None
This was also the view expressed before us by some of the eminent and knowledgeable persons whom we interviewed.	None
As these arguments are selfevident we find it unnecessary to go into them in detail except those relating to constitutional and financial aspects covered by them.	None
6.5.6.	None
The important argument from the constitutional angle is based on the federal type of our Constitution under which there is a constitutional division of powers and functions between the Union and the State.	None
If Delhi becomes a fullfledged State, there will be a constitutional division of sovereign, legislative and executive powers between the Union and the State of Delhi.	None
One of the consequences will be that in respect of matters in the State List, Parliament will have no power on jurisdiction to make any law except in the special and emergency situations provided for under the Constitution and to that extent the Union Executive cannot exercise executive powers or functions.	None
The constitutional prohibition on the exercise of powers and functions will make it virtually impossible for the Union to discharge its special responsibilities in relation to the National Capital as well as to the nation itself.	None
We have already indicated in an earlier chapter the special features of the National Capital and the need for keeping it under the control of the Union Government.	None
Such control is vital in the national interest irrespective of whether the subjectmatter is in the State field or Union field.	None
If the administration of the National Capital is divided into rigid compartments of State field and Union field, conflicts are likely to arise in several vital matters, particularly if the two Governments are run by different political parties.	None
Such conflicts may, at times, prejudice the national interest.	None
xx xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
6.5.9.	None
We are also impressed with the argument that Delhi as the National Capital belongs to the nation as a whole and any constituent State of the Union of which Delhi will become a part would sooner or later acquire a predominant position in relation to other States.	None
Sufficient constitutional authority for Union intervention in daytoday matters, however vital some of them may be, will not be available to the Union, thereby prejudicing the discharge of its national duties and responsibilities.	None
xx xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND COUNCIL OF MINISTERS 6.7.19.	None
As a necessary corollary to the establishment of a responsible Government for Delhi the structure of the executive should be more or less on the pattern provided by the Constitution.	None
Accordingly, there should be a Head of the Administration with a Council of Ministers answerable to the Legislative Assembly.	None
As Delhi will continue to have the status of a Union Territory, Article 239 will apply to it and so it will have an Administrator with such designation as may be specified.	None
The present designation of the Lieutenant Governor may be continued and recognised in the Constitution itself.	None
xx xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
6.7.21.	None
The Administrator should be expressly required to perform his functions on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	None
The expression to aid and advice is a wellunderstood term of art to denote the implications of the Cabinet system of Government adopted by our Constitution.	None
Under this system, the general rule is that the exercise of executive functions by the Administrator has to be on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers which means that it is virtually the Ministers that should take decisions on such matters.	None
However, for Delhi, the following modifications of this general rule will have to be adopted Firstly, the requirement of acting on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers cannot apply to the exercise by the Administrator of any judicial or quasijudicial functions.	None
The reason is obvious because in respect of such functions there is no question of acting on the advice of another person.	None
Secondly, the requirement is only in relation to matters in respect of which the Legislative Assembly has the powers to make laws.	None
This power will be subject to the restrictions already dealt with earlier in the Report.	None
Accordingly, the Council of Ministers will not have jurisdiction to deal with matters excluded from the purview of the Legislative Assembly.	None
Thirdly, there is need for a special provision to resolve differences between the Administrator and his Council of Ministers on any matter concerning the administration of Delhi.	None
Normally, the general principle applicable to the system of responsible Government under the Constitution is that the Head of the Administration should act as a mere constitutional figurehead and will have to accept the advice of the Council of Ministers except when the matter is left to his discretion.	None
However, by virtue of Article 239 of the Constitution, the ultimate responsibility for good administration of Delhi is vested in the President acting through the Administrator.	None
Because of this the Administrator has to take a somewhat more active part in the administration than the Governor of a State.	None
It is, therefore, necessary to reconcile between the need to retain the responsibility of the Administrator to the Centre in this regard and the need to enforce the collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers to the Legislature.	None
The best way of doing this is to provide that in case of difference of opinion which cannot be resolved between the Administrator and his Council of Ministers, he should refer the question to the President and the decision of the President thereon will be final.	None
In cases of urgency, if immediate action is necessary, the Administrator may direct action to be taken pending such decision of the President.	None
A provision of this kind was made for this very reason not only in the 1951 Act, but also in the 1963 Act relating to the Union Territories as well as in the 1978 Bill.	None
The majority opinion thereafter took note of the arguments of both sides.	None
Discussion that followed thereafter was on the following aspects Ideals principles of representative governance Constitutional morality Constitutional objectivity Constitutional governance and the conception of legitimate constitutional trust Collective responsibility Federal functionalism and democracy Collaborative federalism Pragmatic federalism Concept of federal balance Interpretation of the Constitution Purposive interpretation Constitutional culture and pragmatism After discussing in detail the aforesaid tools necessarily required for proper and just interpretation of the concerned provisions, the Court undertook the exercise of interpreting Articles 239, 239A and 239AA of the Constitution.	None
Since, this interpretation is material and significant for deciding specific issues which have been raised in these appeals, we would like to incorporate the portions of the majority judgment which have interpreted these Articles Interpretation of Articles 239 and 239A	None
The aforesaid passages set two guidelines.	None
First, it permits judicial creativity and second, it mentions one to be conscious of pragmatic realism of the obtaining situation and the controversy.	None
That apart, there is a suggestion to take note of the behavioural needs and norms of life.	None
Thus, creativity, practical applicability and perception of reality from the societal perspective are the warrant while engaging oneself with the process of interpretation of a constitutional provision.	None
To settle the controversy at hand, it is imperative that we dig deep and perform a meticulous analysis of Articles 239, 239A, 239AA and 239AB all of which fall in Part VIII of the Constitution bearing the heading, The Union Territories.	None
For this purpose, let us reproduce the aforesaid Articles one by one and carry out the indispensable and crucial task of interpreting them.	None
Article 239 provides for the administration of Union Territories.	Facts
It reads as follows Administration of Union Territories.	None
Save as otherwise provided by Parliament by law, every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify.	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in Part VI, the President may appoint the Governor of a State as the Administrator of an adjoining Union Territory, and where a Governor is so appointed, he shall exercise his functions as such Administrator independently of his Council of Ministers.(emphasis supplied)	None
The said Article was brought into existence by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.	None
Clause (1) of Article 239, by employing the word shall, makes it abundantly clear that every Union Territory is mandatorily to be administered by the President through an Administrator unless otherwise provided by Parliament in the form of a law.	None
Further, clause (1) of Article 239 also stipulates that the said Administrator shall be appointed by the President with such designation as he may specify.	None
Clause (2) thereafter, being a non obstante clause, lays down that irrespective of anything contained in Part VI of the Constitution, the President may appoint the Governor of a State to act as an Administrator of a Union Territory which is adjacent and or contiguous to the State of which he is the Governor.	None
The Governor of a State who is so appointed as an Administrator of an adjoining UT shall exercise his functions as an Administrator of the said UT independently and Autonomously and not as per the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the State of which he is the Governor.	None
In this regard, the Court, in the case of Shamsher Singh (supra), has observed thus The provisions of the Constitution which expressly require the Governor to exercise his powers in his discretion are contained in Articles to which reference has been made.	None
To illustrate, Article 239(2) states that where a Governor is appointed an Administrator of an adjoining Union Territory he shall exercise his functions as such Administrator independently of his Council of Ministers.180.	None
Again, the Court, while interpreting Article 239 in Union of India and others v. Surinder S. observed The unamended Article 239 envisaged administration of the States specified in Part C of the First Schedule of the Constitution by the President through a Chief Commissioner or a Lieutenant Governor to be appointed by him or through the Government of a neighbouring State.	None
This was subject to other provisions of Part VIII of the Constitution.	None
As against this, amended Article 239 lays down that subject to any law enacted by Parliament every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting through an Administrator appointed by him with such designation as he may specify.	Arguments of Petitioner
In terms of clause (2) of Article 239 (amended), the President can appoint the Governor of a State as an Administrator of an adjoining Union Territory and on his appointment, the Governor is required to exercise his function as an Administrator independently of his Council of Ministers.	None
The difference in the language of the unamended and amended Article 239 makes it clear that prior to 1111956, the President could administer Part C State through a Chief Commissioner or a Lieutenant Governor, but, after the amendment, every Union Territory is required to be administered by the President through an Administrator appointed by him with such designation as he may specify.	None
In terms of clause (2) of Article 239 (amended), the President is empowered to appoint the Governor of State as the Administrator to an adjoining Union Territory and once appointed, the Governor, in his capacity as Administrator, has to act independently of the Council of Ministers of the State of which he is the Governor.181.	None
Now, let us proceed to scan Article 239A of the Constitution which deals with the creation of local legislatures or Council of Ministers or both for certain Union Territories.	None
It reads as follows 239A. Creation of local legislatures or Council of Ministers or both for certain Union Territories.	None
Parliament may by law create for the Union Territory of Puducherry (a) a body, whether elected or partly nominated and partly elected, to function as a legislature for the Union Territory, or (b) a Council of Ministers, or both with such constitution, powers and functions, in each case, as may be specified in the law.	None
Any such law as is referred to in clause (1) shall not be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 notwithstanding that it contains any provision which amends or has the effect of amending this Constitution.182.	None
The aforesaid Article was brought into force by the Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) Act, 1962.	None
Prior to the year 1971, under Article 239A, Parliament had the power to create by law legislatures and or Council of Ministers for the then Union Territories of Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur, Goa and Daman and Diu.	None
Thereafter, on 2511971, Himachal Pradesh acquired Statehood and consequently, Himachal Pradesh was omitted from Article 239A.	None
Subsequently, on 2111972, Tripura and Manipur were granted Statehood as a consequence of which both Manipur and Tripura were omitted from Article 239A. Likewise, with the enactment of the Goa, Daman and Diu Reorganisation Act, 1987 on 3051987, both Goa and Daman and Diu were omitted from Article 239A. Parliament, under the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, created legislatures for the then Union Territories and accordingly, even after 3051987, the applicability of Article 239A stands limited to UT of Puducherry.	None
As a natural corollary, the Union Territory of Puducherry stands on a different footing from other UTs of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Lakshadweep and Chandigarh.	None
However, we may hasten to add that Puducherry cannot be compared with the NCT of Delhi as it is solely governed by the provisions of Article 239A. Interpretation of Article 239AA of the Constitution We shall now advert to the interpretation of Articles 239AA and 239AB of the Constitution which are the gravamen of the present batch of appeals.	None
The said Articles require an elaborate interpretation and a thorough analysis to unearth and discover the true intention of Parliament while inserting the said Articles, in exercise of its constituent power, by the Constitution (Sixtyninth Amendment) Act, 1991.	None
The said Articles read as follows 239AA.	None
Special provisions with respect to Delhi.(1)	None
As from the date of commencement of the Constitution (Sixtyninth Amendment) Act, 1991, the Union Territory of Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory of Delhi (hereafter in this Part referred to as the National Capital Territory) and the Administrator thereof appointed under Article 239 shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2)(a)	None
There shall be a Legislative Assembly for the National Capital Territory and the seats in such Assembly shall be filled by Members chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the National Capital Territory.	None
The total number of seats in the Legislative Assembly, the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, the division of the National Capital Territory into territorial constituencies (including the basis for such division) and all other matters relating to the functioning of the Legislative Assembly shall be regulated by law made by Parliament.	None
The provisions of Articles 324 to 327 and 329 shall apply in relation to the National Capital Territory, the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory and the Members thereof as they apply, in relation to a State, the Legislative Assembly of a State and the Members thereof respectively and any reference in Articles 326 and 329 to appropriate Legislature shall be deemed to be a reference to Parliament.	None
(3)(a) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for the whole or any part of the National Capital Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18.	Arguments of Respondent
Nothing in subclause (a) shall derogate from the powers of Parliament under this Constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for a Union Territory or any part thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
If any provision of a law made by the Legislative Assembly with respect to any matter is repugnant to any provision of a law made by Parliament with respect to that matter, whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislative Assembly, or of an earlier law, other than a law made by the Legislative Assembly, then, in either case, the law made by Parliament, or, as the case may be, such earlier law, shall prevail and the law made by the Legislative Assembly shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void Provided that if any such law made by the Legislative Assembly has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, such law shall prevail in the National Capital Territory Provided further that nothing in this subclause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislative Assembly.	None
There shall be a Council of Ministers consisting of not more than ten per cent of the total number of Members in the Legislative Assembly, with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his functions in relation to matters with respect to which the Legislative Assembly has power to make laws, except insofar as he is, by or under any law, required to act in his discretion Provided that in the case of difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any matter, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the President and pending such decision it shall be competent for the Lieutenant Governor in any case where the matter, in his opinion, is so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, to take such action or to give such direction in the matter as he deems necessary.	None
The Chief Minister shall be appointed by the President and other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Chief Minister and the Ministers shall hold office during the pleasure of the President.	None
The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly.	None
(7)(a) Parliament may, by law, make provisions for giving effect to, or supplementing the provisions contained in the foregoing clauses and for all matters incidental or consequential thereto.	None
Any such law as is referred to in subclause (a) shall not be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of Article 368 notwithstanding that it contains any provision which amends or has the effect of amending, this Constitution.	None
The provisions of Article 239B shall, so far as may be, apply in relation to the National Capital Territory, the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Assembly, as they apply in relation to the Union Territory of Puducherry, the Administrator and its legislature, respectively and any reference in that Article to clause (1) of Article 239A shall be deemed to be a reference to this Article or Article 239AB, as the case may be.	None
239AB.	None
Provision in case of failure of constitutional machinery.	Arguments of Respondent
If the President, on receipt of a report from the Lieutenant Governor or otherwise, is satisfied (a) that a situation has arisen in which the administration of the National Capital Territory cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of Article 239AA or of any law made in pursuance of that Article or (b) that for the proper administration of the National Capital Territory it is necessary or expedient so to do, the President may by order suspend the operation of any provision of Article 239AA or of all or any of the provisions of any law made in pursuance of that Article for such period and subject to such conditions as may be specified in such law and make such incidental and consequential provisions as may appear to him to be necessary or expedient for administering the National Capital Territory in accordance with the provisions of Article 239 and Article 239AA.	Arguments of Respondent
(emphasis supplied)	None
We deem it appropriate to refer to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the amendment which reads thus The question of reorganisation of the administrative setup in the Union Territory of Delhi has been under the consideration of the Government for some time.	None
The Government of India appointed on 24121987 a Committee to go into the various issues connected with the administration of Delhi and to recommend measures inter alia for the streamlining of the administrative setup.	None
The Committee went into the matter in great detail and considered the issues after holding discussions with various individuals, associations, political parties and other experts and taking into account the arrangements in the national capitals of other countries with a federal setup and also the debates in the Constituent Assembly as also the reports by earlier Committees and Commissions.	None
After such detailed inquiry and examination, it recommended that Delhi should continue to be a Union Territory and provided with a Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers responsible to such Assembly with appropriate powers to deal with matters of concern to the common man.	None
The Committee also recommended that with a view to ensure stability and permanence the arrangements should be incorporated in the Constitution to give the National Capital a special status among the Union Territories.	None
The Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals.	None
The aforesaid, as we perceive, really conceives of conferring special status on Delhi.	None
This fundamental grammar has to be kept in view when we penetrate into the interpretative dissection of Article 239AA and other articles that are pertinent to understand the said provision.	None
The aforesaid, as we perceive, really conceives of conferring special status on Delhi.	None
This fundamental grammar has to be kept in view when we penetrate into the interpretative dissection of Article 239AA and other articles that are pertinent to understand the said provision.	None
After interpreting the provisions in the manner aforesaid, the Court concentrated on the status of NCTD, in particular.	None
In the process, it referred to earlier judgment in the case of Samsher Singh vs. State of Punjab (1974) 2 SCC 831 , from which it culled out the powers of the Governor in a State where the Governor was empowered to act in his discretion.	None
It observed Thereafter, A.N. Ray, C.J. discussed the provisions of the Constitution as well as a couple of paragraphs of the Sixth Schedule wherein the words in his discretion are used in relation to certain powers of the Governor to highlight the fact that a Governor can act in his discretion only when the provisions of the Constitution so permit.	None
In this context, we may refer with profit to the authority in Devji Vallabhbhai Tandel v. Administrator of Goa, Daman Diu Devji Vallabhbhai Tandel v. Administrator of Goa, Daman Diu, (1982) 2 SCC 222 1982 SCC (Cri) 403 .	None
In the said case, the issue that arose for consideration was whether the role and functions of the Administrator stipulated under the Union Territories Act, 1963 is similar to those of a Governor of a State and as such, whether the Administrator has to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	None
The Court considered the relevant provisions and after comparing the language of Articles 74 and 163 of the Constitution with the language of Section 44 of the Union Territories Act, 1963, it observed that the Administrator, even in matters where he is not required to act in his discretion under the Act or where he is not exercising any judicial or quasijudicial functions, is not bound to act according to the advice of the Council of Ministers and the same is manifest from the proviso to Section 44(1).	None
The Court went on to say (SCC pp. 22930, paras 1415)	None
It transpires from the proviso that in the event of a difference of opinion between the Administrator and his Ministers on any matter, the Administrator shall refer the matter to the President for decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the President.	None
If the President in a given situation agrees with what the Administrator opines contrary to the advice of the Council of Ministers, the Administrator would be able to override the advice of the Council of Ministers and on a reference to the President under the proviso, obviously the President would act according to the advice of the Council of Ministers given under Article 74.	None
Virtually, therefore, in the event of a difference of opinion between the Council of Ministers of the Union Territory and the Administrator, the right to decide would vest in the Union Government and the Council of Ministers of the Union Territory would be bound by the view taken by the Union Government.	None
Further, the Administrator enjoys still some more power to act in derogation of the advice of the Council of Ministers.	None
The second limb of the proviso to Section 44(1) enables the Administrator that in the event of a difference of opinion between him and the Council of Ministers not only he can refer the matter to the President but during the interregnum where the matter is in his opinion so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, he has the power to take such action or to give such directions in the matter as he deems necessary.	None
In other words, during the interregnum he can completely override the advice of the Council of Ministers and act according to his light.	None
Neither the Governor nor the President enjoys any such power.	None
This basic functional difference in the powers and position enjoyed by the Governor and the President on the one hand and the Administrator on the other is so glaring that it is not possible to hold on the analogy of the decision in Samsher Singh case Samsher Singh v. State of Punjab, (1974) 2 SCC 831 1974 SCC (LS) 550 that the Administrator is purely a constitutional functionary bound to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers and cannot act on his own.(emphasis supplied)	None
Thereafter, various other judgments were taken note of including Nine Judge Bench in NDMC v. State of Punjab (1997) 7 SCC 339 case which specifically deal with the status of NCTD.	None
Following paragraphs on this aspect need a reproduction The Governor of a State, as per Article 163, is bound by the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers in the exercise of his functions except where he is, by or under the Constitution, required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.	None
Thus, the Governor may act in his discretion only if he is so permitted by an express provision of the Constitution.	None
As far as the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is concerned, as per Article 239AA(4), he is bound by the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers in matters for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has legislative powers.	None
However, this is subject to the proviso contained in clause (4) of Article 239AA which gives the power to the Lieutenant Governor that in case of any difference between him and his Ministers, he shall refer the same to the President for a binding decision.	Reasoning
This proviso to clause (4) has retained the powers for the Union even over matters falling within the legislative domain of the Delhi Assembly.	None
This overriding power of the Union to legislate qua other Union Territories is exposited under Article 246(4).	None
The Court, thereafter, specifically focused on the executive power of the Council of Ministers of Delhi and made following remarks on this particular aspect Drawing an analogy while interpreting the provisions of Article 239AA(3)(a) and Article 239AA(4) would reveal that the executive power of the Government of NCT of Delhi is conterminous with the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly which is envisaged in Article 239AA(3) and which extends over all but three subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List and, thus, Article 239AA(4) confers executive power on the Council of Ministers over all those subjects for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has legislative power.	None
The legislative power conferred upon the Delhi Legislative Assembly is to give effect to legislative enactments as per the needs and requirements of Delhi whereas the executive power is conferred on the executive to implement certain policy decisions.	None
This view is also strengthened by the fact that after the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution by which the words Part C States were substituted by the words Union Territories, the word State in the proviso to Article 73 cannot be read to mean Union Territory as such an interpretation would render the scheme and purpose of Part VIII (Union Territories) of the Constitution infructuous.	None
Next facet of discussion was on the essence of Article 239AA of the Constitution.	None
It would be of use to take note of the following discussion on this aspect At the outset, we must declare that the insertion of Articles 239AA and 239AB, which specifically pertain to NCT of Delhi, is reflective of the intention of Parliament to accord Delhi a sui generis status from the other Union Territories as well as from the Union Territory of Puducherry to which Article 239A is singularly applicable as on date.	Arguments of Petitioner
The same has been authoritatively held by the majority judgment in NDMC case NDMC v. State of Punjab, (1997) 7 SCC 339 to the effect that the NCT of Delhi is a class by itself.	None
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
We have highlighted this difference to underscore and emphasise the intention of Parliament, while inserting Article 239AA in the exercise of its constituent power, to treat the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi as a set of elected representatives of the voters of NCT of Delhi and to treat the Government of NCT of Delhi as a representative form of Government.	None
The Legislative Assembly is wholly comprised of elected representatives who are chosen by direct elections and are sent to Delhis Legislative Assembly by the voters of Delhi.	None
None of the Members of Delhis Legislative Assembly are nominated.	None
The elected representatives and the Council of Ministers of Delhi, being accountable to the voters of Delhi, must have the appropriate powers so as to perform their functions effectively and efficiently.	None
This is also discernible from the Balakrishnan Committee Report which recommended that though Delhi should continue to be a Union Territory, yet it should be provided with a Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers responsible to such Assembly with appropriate powers to deal with matters of concern to the common man.	None
Subclause (a) of clause (3) of Article 239AA establishes the power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly to enact laws for NCT of Delhi with respect to matters enumerated in the State List and or Concurrent List except insofar as matters with respect to and which relate to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List.	Arguments of Petitioner
Subclause (b) of clause (3) lays down that Parliament has the powers to make laws with respect to any matter for a Union Territory including NCT of Delhi or any part thereof and subclause (a) shall not derogate such powers of Parliament.	Reasoning
Subclause (c) of clause (3) gives Parliament the overriding power to the effect that where any provision of any law made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi is repugnant to any provision of law made by Parliament, then the law made by Parliament shall prevail and the law made by the Delhi Legislative Assembly shall be void to the extent of repugnancy.	Reasoning
Thus, it is evident from clause (3) of Article 239AA that Parliament has the power to make laws for NCT of Delhi on any of the matters enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent List and at the same time, the Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has the legislative power with respect to matters enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent List except matters with respect to entries which have been explicitly excluded from Article 239AA(3) (a).	Arguments of Petitioner
Now, it is essential to analyse clause (4) of Article 239AA, the most important provision for determination of the controversy at hand.	None
Clause (4) stipulates a Westminster style Cabinet system of Government for NCT of Delhi where there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his functions in relation to matters with respect to which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has power to enact laws except in matters in respect of which the Lieutenant Governor is required to act in his discretion.	None
The proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA stipulates that in case of a difference of opinion on any matter between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for a binding decision.	Reasoning
Further, pending such decision by the President, in any case where the matter, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, is so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, the proviso makes him competent to take such action and issue such directions as he deems necessary.	None
A conjoint reading of Article 239AA(3)(a) and Article 239AA(4) reveals that the executive power of the Government of NCT of Delhi is coextensive with the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly which is envisaged in Article 239AA(3) and which extends over all but three subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List and, thus, Article 239AA(4) confers executive power on the Council of Ministers over all those subjects for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has legislative power.	None
Article 239AA(3)(a) reserves Parliaments legislative power on all matters in the State List and Concurrent List, but clause (4) nowhere reserves the executive powers of the Union with respect to such matters.	None
On the contrary, clause (4) explicitly grants to the Government of Delhi executive powers in relation to matters for which the Legislative Assembly has power to legislate.	None
The legislative power is conferred upon the Assembly to enact whereas the policy of the legislation has to be given effect to by the executive for which the Government of Delhi has to have coextensive executive powers.	None
Such a view is in consonance with the observation in Ram Jawaya Kapur Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab, AIR 1955 SC 549 which has been discussed elaborately in the earlier part of the judgment.	None
Article 239AA(4) confers executive powers on the Government of NCT of Delhi whereas the executive power of the Union stems from Article 73 and is coextensive with Parliaments legislative power.	None
Further, the ideas of pragmatic federalism and collaborative federalism will fall to the ground if we are to say that the Union has overriding executive powers even in respect of matters for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has legislative powers.	None
Thus, it can be very well said that the executive power of the Union in respect of NCT of Delhi is confined to the three matters in the State List for which the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly has been excluded under Article 239AA(3)(a).	Arguments of Petitioner
Such an interpretation would thwart any attempt on the part of the Union Government to seize all control and allow the concepts of pragmatic federalism and federal balance to prevail by giving NCT of Delhi some degree of required independence in its functioning subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution.	None
xx xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
The proviso to Article 239AA(4), we say without any fear of contradiction, cannot be interpreted in a strict sense of the mere words employed treating them as only letters without paying heed to the thought and the spirit which they intend to convey.	None
They are not to be treated as bones and flesh without nerves and neurons that make the nerves functional.	None
We feel, it is necessary in the context to read the words of the provision in the spirit of citizenry participation in the governance of a democratic polity that is republican in character.	None
We may hasten to add that when we say so, it should not be construed that there is allowance of enormous entry of judicial creativity, for the construction one intends to place has its plinth and platform on the Preamble and precedents pertaining to constitutional interpretation and purposive interpretation keeping in view the conception of sense and spirit of the Constitution.	None
It is, in a way, exposition of judicial sensibility to the functionalism of the Constitution.	None
And we call it constitutional pragmatism.	None
The majority opinion also concentrated on the GNCTD Act, 1991 as well as Transaction of Business of the GNCTD Rules, 1993.	None
Its analysis of various provisions of the said Act and Rules led to, inter alia, the following discussion Upon scanning the anatomy of the 1991 Act, we find that the Act contains fiftysix sections and is divided into five Parts, each dealing with different fields.	None
Now, we may refer to some of the provisions contained in Part IV of the 1991 Act titled Certain Provisions relating to Lieutenant Governor and Ministers which are relevant to the case at hand.	None
Section 41 deals with matters in which the Lieutenant Governor may act in his discretion and reads thus Matters in which Lieutenant Governor to act in his discretion.	Arguments of Respondent
The Lieutenant Governor shall act in his discretion in a matter which falls outside the purview of the powers conferred on the Legislative Assembly but in respect of which powers or functions are entrusted or delegated to him by the President or in which he is required by or under any law to act in his discretion or to exercise any judicial or quasijudicial functions.	Arguments of Respondent
If any question arises as to whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Lieutenant Governor is by or under any law required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Lieutenant Governor thereon shall be final.	Arguments of Respondent
If any question arises as to whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which the Lieutenant Governor is required by any law to exercise any judicial or quasijudicial functions, the decision of the Lieutenant Governor thereon shall be final.	Arguments of Respondent
A careful perusal of Section 41 of the 1991 Act shows that the Lieutenant Governor can act in his discretion only in matters which fall outside the legislative competence of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi or in respect of matters of which powers are entrusted or delegated to him by the President or where he is required by law to act in his discretion or to exercise any judicial or quasijudicial functions and, therefore, it is clear that the Lieutenant Governor cannot exercise his discretion in each and every matter and by and large, his discretionary powers are limited to the three matters over which the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly stands excluded by clause (3)(a) of Article 239AA.	None
Another important provision is Section 49 of the 1991 Act which falls under Part V of the Act titled Miscellaneous and Transitional Provisions and stipulates the relation of the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers to the President.	None
Section 49 reads thus Relation of Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers to President.	None
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers shall be under the general control of, and comply with such particular directions, if any, as may from timetotime be given by the President.254.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 49 of the 1991 Act discloses that the setup in NCT of Delhi is one where the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister on one hand and the Lieutenant Governor on the other are a team, a pair on a bicycle built for two with the President as its rider who retains the general control.	None
Needless to say, the President, while exercising this general control, acts as per the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers.	None
We would now like to reproduce, in entirety, the conclusions which the majority judgment arrived at.	None
These are as under The conclusions in seriatim In view of our aforesaid analysis, we record our conclusions in seriatim 284.1.	None
While interpreting the provisions of the Constitution, the safe and most sound approach for the constitutional courts to adopt is to read the words of the Constitution in the light of the spirit of the Constitution so that the quintessential democratic nature of our Constitution and the paradigm of representative participation by way of citizenry engagement are not annihilated.	None
The courts must adopt such an interpretation which glorifies the democratic spirit of the Constitution.	None
284.2.	None
In a democratic republic, the collective who are the sovereign elect their lawmaking representatives for enacting laws and shaping policies which are reflective of the popular will.	None
The elected representatives being accountable to the public must be accessible, approachable and act in a transparent manner.	None
Thus, the elected representatives must display constitutional objectivity as a standard of representative governance which neither tolerates ideological fragmentation nor encourages any utopian fantasy, rather it lays stress on constitutional ideologies.	None
284.3.	None
Constitutional morality, appositely understood, means the morality that has inherent elements in the constitutional norms and the conscience of the Constitution.	None
Any act to garner justification must possess the potentiality to be in harmony with the constitutional impulse.	None
In order to realise our constitutional vision, it is indispensable that all citizens and high functionaries in particular inculcate a spirit of constitutional morality which negates the idea of concentration of power in the hands of a few.	None
284.4.	None
All the three organs of the State must remain true to the Constitution by upholding the trust reposed by the Constitution in them.	None
The decisions taken by constitutional functionaries and the process by which such decisions are taken must have normative reasonability and acceptability.	None
Such decisions, therefore, must be in accord with the principles of constitutional objectivity and symphonious with the spirit of the Constitution.	None
284.5.	None
The Constitution being the supreme instrument envisages the concept of constitutional governance which has, as its twin limbs, the principles of fiduciary nature of public power and the system of checks and balances.	None
Constitutional governance, in turn, gives birth to the requisite constitutional trust which must be exhibited by all constitutional functionaries while performing their official duties.	None
284.6.	None
Ours is a parliamentary form of Government guided by the principle of collective responsibility of the Cabinet.	None
The Cabinet owes a duty towards the legislature for every action taken in any of the Ministries and every individual Minister is responsible for every act of the Ministry.	None
This principle of collective responsibility is of immense significance in the context of aid and advice.	None
If a welldeliberated legitimate decision of the Council of Ministers is not given effect to due to an attitude to differ on the part of the Lieutenant Governor, then the concept of collective responsibility would stand negated.	None
284.7.	None
Our Constitution contemplates a meaningful orchestration of federalism and democracy to put in place an egalitarian social order, a classical unity in a contemporaneous diversity and a pluralistic milieu in eventual cohesiveness without losing identity.	None
Sincere attempts should be made to give fullfledged effect to both these concepts.	None
284.8.	None
The constitutional vision beckons both the Central and the State Governments alike with the aim to have a holistic edifice.	None
Thus, the Union and the State Governments must embrace a collaborative federal architecture by displaying harmonious coexistence and interdependence so as to avoid any possible constitutional discord.	None
Acceptance of pragmatic federalism and achieving federal balance has become a necessity requiring disciplined wisdom on the part of the Union and the State Governments by demonstrating a pragmatic orientation.	None
284.9.	None
The Constitution has mandated a federal balance wherein independence of a certain required degree is assured to the State Governments.	None
As opposed to centralism, a balanced federal structure mandates that the Union does not usurp all powers and the States enjoy freedom without any unsolicited interference from the Central Government with respect to matters which exclusively fall within their domain.	None
284.10.	None
There is no dearth of authorities with regard to the method and approach to be embraced by constitutional courts while interpreting the constitutional provisions.	None
Some lay more emphasis on one approach over the other, while some emphasise that a mixed balance resulting in a unique methodology shall serve as the best tool.	None
In spite of diverse views on the said concept, what must be kept primarily in mind is that the Constitution is a dynamic and heterogeneous instrument, the interpretation of which requires consideration of several factors which must be given their due weightage in order to come up with a solution harmonious with the purpose with which the different provisions were introduced by the Framers of the Constitution or Parliament.	None
284.11.	None
In the light of the contemporary issues, the purposive method has gained importance over the literal approach and the constitutional courts, with the vision to realise the true and ultimate purpose of the Constitution not only in letter but also in spirit and armed with the tools of ingenuity and creativity, must not shy away from performing this foremost duty to achieve constitutional functionalism by adopting a pragmatic approach.	None
It is, in a way, exposition of judicial sensibility to the functionalism of the Constitution which we call constitutional pragmatism.	None
The spirit and conscience of the Constitution should not be lost in grammar and the popular will of the people which has its legitimacy in a democratic setup cannot be allowed to lose its purpose in simple semantics.	None
284.12.	None
In the light of the ruling of the nineJudge Bench in NDMC NDMC v. State of Punjab, (1997) 7 SCC 339 , it is clear as noonday that by no stretch of imagination, NCT of Delhi can be accorded the status of a State under our present constitutional scheme.	None
The status of NCT of Delhi is sui generis, a class apart, and the status of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is not that of a Governor of a State, rather he remains an Administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
284.13.	None
With the insertion of Article 239AA by virtue of the Sixtyninth Amendment, Parliament envisaged a representative form of Government for NCT of Delhi.	None
The said provision intends to provide for the Capital a directly elected Legislative Assembly which shall have legislative powers over matters falling within the State List and the Concurrent List, barring those excepted, and a mandate upon the Lieutenant Governor to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except when he decides to refer the matter to the President for final decision.	None
284.14.	None
The interpretative dissection of Article 239AA(3)(a) reveals that Parliament has the power to make laws for the National Capital Territory of Delhi with respect to any matters enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent List.	None
At the same time, the Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has the power to make laws over all those subjects which figure in the Concurrent List and all, but three excluded subjects, in the State List.	Arguments of Petitioner
284.15.	None
A conjoint reading of clauses (3)(a) and (4) of Article 239AA divulges that the executive power of the Government of NCTD is coextensive with the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and, accordingly, the executive power of the Council of Ministers of Delhi spans over all subjects in the Concurrent List and all, but three excluded subjects, in the State List.	Arguments of Respondent
However, if Parliament makes law in respect of certain subjects falling in the State List or the Concurrent List, the executive action of the State must conform to the law made by Parliament.	Arguments of Respondent
284.16.	None
As a natural corollary, the Union of India has exclusive executive power with respect to NCT of Delhi relating to the three matters in the State List in respect of which the power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly has been excluded.	Arguments of Petitioner
In respect of other matters, the executive power is to be exercised by the Government of NCT of Delhi.	None
This, however, is subject to the proviso to Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution.	None
Such an interpretation would be in consonance with the concepts of pragmatic federalism and federal balance by giving the Government of NCT of Delhi some required degree of independence subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution.	None
284.17.	None
The meaning of aid and advise employed in Article 239AA(4) has to be construed to mean that the Lieutenant Governor of NCT of Delhi is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers and this position holds true so long as the Lieutenant Governor does not exercise his power under the proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA.	None
The Lieutenant Governor has not been entrusted with any independent decisionmaking power.	None
He has to either act on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers or he is bound to implement the decision taken by the President on a reference being made by him.	None
284.18.	None
The words any matter employed in the proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA cannot be inferred to mean every matter.	None
The power of the Lieutenant Governor under the said proviso represents the exception and not the general rule which has to be exercised in exceptional circumstances by the Lieutenant Governor keeping in mind the standards of constitutional trust and morality, the principle of collaborative federalism and constitutional balance, the concept of constitutional governance and objectivity and the nurtured and cultivated idea of respect for a representative Government.	None
The Lieutenant Governor should not act in a mechanical manner without due application of mind so as to refer every decision of the Council of Ministers to the President.	None
284.19.	None
The difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers should have a sound rationale and there should not be exposition of the phenomenon of an obstructionist but reflection of the philosophy of affirmative constructionism and profound sagacity and judiciousness.	None
284.20.	None
The Transaction of Business Rules, 1993 stipulate the procedure to be followed by the Lieutenant Governor in case of difference between him and his Ministers.	None
The Lieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers must attempt to settle any point of difference by way of discussion and dialogue.	None
By contemplating such a procedure, the 1993 TBR suggest that the Lieutenant Governor must work harmoniously with his Ministers and must not seek to resist them at every step of the way.	None
The need for harmonious resolution by discussion is recognised especially to sustain the representative form of governance as has been contemplated by the insertion of Article 239AA.	None
284.21.	None
The scheme that has been conceptualised by the insertion of Articles 239AA and 239AB read with the provisions of the GNCTD Act, 1991 and the corresponding the 1993 TBR indicates that the Lieutenant Governor, being the administrative head, shall be kept informed with respect to all the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers.	None
The terminology send a copy thereof to the Lieutenant Governor, forwarded to the Lieutenant Governor, submitted to the Lieutenant Governor and cause to be furnished to the Lieutenant Governor employed in the said Rules leads to the only possible conclusion that the decisions of the Council of Ministers must be communicated to the Lieutenant Governor but this does not mean that the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor is required.	None
The said communication is imperative so as to keep him apprised in order to enable him to exercise the power conferred upon him under Article 239AA(4) and the proviso thereof.	None
284.22.	None
The authorities in power should constantly remind themselves that they are constitutional functionaries and they have the responsibility to ensure that the fundamental purpose of administration is the welfare of the people in an ethical manner.	None
There is requirement of discussion and deliberation.	None
The fine nuances are to be dwelled upon with mutual respect.	None
Neither of the authorities should feel that they have been lionised.	None

Fulfilment of constitutional idealism ostracising anything that is not permissible by the language of the provisions of the Constitution and showing veneration to its sense, spirit and silence is constitutional renaissance.	None
It has to be remembered that our Constitution is a constructive one.	None

There is no space for anarchy.	None
Sometimes it is argued, though in a different context, that one can be a rational anarchist, but the said term has no entry in the field of constitutional governance and rule of law.	None
The constitutional functionaries are expected to cultivate the understanding of constitutional renaissance by realisation of their constitutional responsibility and sincere acceptance of the summon to be obeisant to the constitutional conscience with a sense of reawakening to the vision of the great living document so as to enable true blossoming of the constitutional ideals.	None
The Lieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister are to constantly remain alive to this idealism.	None
The Reference is answered accordingly.	None
Matters be placed before the appropriate regular Bench.	None
The lucid and equally well considered opinions have been rendered by Justice Dhananjay Y. Chandrachud and one of us (Justice Ashok Bhushan) which are substantially on the same lines as the majority opinion.	None
There is, however, a slight difference in approach and to some extent discordant note is expressed in the opinion of Justice Ashok Bhushan.	None
We would advert to these opinions and as well as the area of difference at the appropriate stage.	None
Ratio of the Judgment There is some dispute as to the exact ratio laid down in the judgment of the Constitution Bench as well as the precise principles set out therein.	Reasoning
As per the the appellants, the Constitution Bench has accepted that in a democratic setup where a Government is formed on the basis of elections by the people, it is that Government, through Council of Ministers, which has the right to govern.	Reasoning
Accepting this fundamental principle as enshrined in the Constitution, the Constitution Bench has recognised that Legislative Assembly for NCTD has the power to make laws for the whole or any part of the NCTD, with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List.	Reasoning
The only exclusion where the Legislative Assembly of NCTD is debarred from making laws, are the subject matters of Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65, 66 of the State List insofar as these Entries related to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18.	Reasoning
The CB judgment specifically addressed the issue of the executive power of the GNCTD, viz., whether it is coextensive with the legislative power.	Reasoning
To that extent, the principle of such coextensive executive power, which is recognised for the Union Central Government as well as State Governments, has been accepted in the case of GNCTD as well.	Reasoning
Thus, in this hue, the Constitution Bench has also accepted that the Lieutenant Governor is to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers in all his acts, except those functions where the Lieutenant Governor is permitted to exercise his own discretion.	Reasoning
Since this executive power is coextensive with legislate power, the appellants emphasised before us that the Constitution Bench has categorically held that this power extends over all the subjects except three subjects in the State List, i.e., Entries 1, 2 and 18.	None
The executive power also extends to all subjects in the Concurrent List.	None
The appellants also submitted that this executive power is to the exclusion of the executive power of the Union with respect to such matters, meaning thereby such power exclusively vests with the GNCTD.	None
The aforesaid manner of reading the Constitution Bench judgment is disputed by the respondents.	Arguments of Respondent
Insofar as legislative domain of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi is concerned, though the respondents accept that the Legislative Assembly has the power to make laws in respect of all the Entries in List II except matters with respect to Entries 1,2 and 18 and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of List II insofar as they relate to said Entries 1, 2 and 18 and also power to legislate in respect of subject matters contained in the Concurrent List (List III).	Arguments of Respondent
However, their submission is that this power is not exclusive to the Legislative Assembly of Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
On the contrary, the power of the Union, i.e., Parliament to legislate on any entries of List II as well as List III remains intact.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, wherever Union has exercised the power by making laws in respect of any such subject matter, it is the Unions law which shall prevail in case of any repugnancy in the light of Article 246 of the Constitution.	None
Insofar as executive power of the GNCTD is concerned, the submission of the respondents is that though the Constitution Bench has held that such executive power is coextensive with the legislative power, but it has nowhere held that such a power is exclusively conferred upon the GNCTD, i.e., to the exclusion of the Union.	Reasoning
Here also, according to the respondents, power of the Union remains intact, which is clear from the plain language of Article 239AA of the Constitution itself.	Arguments of Respondent
The detailed submissions which were made by M s. C.A. Sundaram, Rakesh Dwivedi and Maninder Singh, learned Senior Counsel who appeared for Union of India in different appeals are of the following nature It is submitted that two primary contentions had been raised on behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi before the Delhi High Court as well as before this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
It had been contended that Article 239 has no applicability whatsoever in the case of NCT of Delhi and (ii) NCT Delhi deserves to be treated as a State and not as a Union Territory because it has an elected Council of Ministers like any other State.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is argued that the abovementioned contentions had been raised on behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi only with a view to claim exclusive Executive jurisdiction in relation to Entries in List II and List III of the 7 th Schedule of the constitution of India (except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries a, 2 and 18).	Arguments of Petitioner
This claim was founded on its basic contention that since there is an elected Council of Ministers in NCT Delhi, it should be treated as equivalent to a State.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was in support of this contention raised by GNCTD that the prayer for nonapplicability of Article 239 in the case of NCT Delhi had also been made.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, on behalf of the Union of India, it had been contended before this Court that the Scheme in the Constitution of India envisages at the threshold vestige of executive power in the President of India under Article 53 of the Constitution of India to be exercised by the President on the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers.	Arguments of Respondent
It is only after the vestige of the executive power takes place under Article 53 of the Constitution of India that the subsequent provisions of Article 73 and Article 246 define the extent of Executive and Legislative powers of the Union by dividing the Entries in the 3 Lists of the 7 th Schedule, between the Union on the one hand and the States on the other.	Arguments of Respondent
In the same manner, the provision of Article 152 applies the same rule of vesting of the executive power in relation to all items mentioned in List II of the 7 th Schedule, in the Governor of any State to be exercised by the Council of Ministers of the said State Government.	Arguments of Respondent
In other words, it had been submission of both Government of NCT of Delhi and Union of India before the constitution Bench of this court that unless and until this Court accepts the claim of the Government of NCT of Delhi that NCT Delhi would deserve to be treated as a State, the claim that Exclusive Executive Jurisdiction in relation to all items in List II (except matters with respect of Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18 would vest in NCT Delhi could not be accepted and would deserve to be rejected.	Arguments of Respondent
It is argued that the claim of GNCTD that a State is specifically rejected by the Constitution Bench.	None
Further, having regard to the critical fact of the NCT Delhi being the National Capital and all eventual responsibilities rest on the shoulders of the Union Government, the President of India shall continue to exercise Exclusive Executive Jurisdiction with regard to Item Nos. 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries e,w and 18 and shall continue to possess the nonexclusive executive jurisdiction in relation to all other entries in List II as well as List III of the Seventh Schedule.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents further argued that there are three prominent features of the judgment of this Court in the case of Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
v. State of Punjab AIR 1995 SC 549.	Arguments of Respondent
Those prominent three features are There has to be a vestige of executive power in any Government before it makes any claim to exercise the said executive power before framing of any legislation.	Arguments of Respondent
It paragraphs 12 and 14 of the said judgment in Ram Jawaya Kapurs case, this Court has referred to the vestige of executive power in the President of India under Article 53 and in the Governor of each State under Article 152 of the Constitution of India.	Arguments of Respondent
Having considered the abovementioned aspect of vestige of executive power in the Government, this Court held that with reference to all the Entries in List I, the Union Government shall have the Exclusive Executive Jurisdiction coextensive with the legislative power and would be able to exercise the said executive power without framing any legislation.	Arguments of Respondent
Similarly, the State shall have executive power in relation to subjects in List II and List III of the Constitution of India.	Arguments of Respondent
However, once the Parliament and or any State Legislature frames any legislation, the executive power of the respective governments shall be strictly in accordance with the provisions of any said legislation.	Arguments of Respondent
Para 12 of the judgment in Ram Jawaya Kapur The abovementioned third proposition as has been held by this Court in Ram Jawaya Kapurs judgment, has been reiterated in various subsequent judgments of this Court including in the judgment of the Constitution Bench of this court in the present case on July 04, 2018 where the following dictum had been incorporated 277 .(xv)However, if the Parliament makes law in respect of certain subjects falling in the State List or the Concurrent List, the executive action of the State must conform to the law made by the Parliament.	None
The respondents point out that in all the three opinions constituting the judgment dated July 04, 2018, this Court has specifically and categorically rejected both the abovementioned contentions raised on behalf of the NCT Delhi and has categorically held that Article 239 continues to apply to NCT Delhi and further that NCT Delhi is not a State but continues to remain a Union Territory.	Arguments of Respondent
Reference in this regard may be made to the following paras	None
Thus, NDMC NDMC v. State of Punjab, (1997) 7 SCC 339 makes it clear as crystal that all Union Territories under our constitutional scheme are not on the same pedestal and as far as NCT of Delhi is concerned, it is not a State within the meaning of Article 246 or Part VI of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
Though NCT of Delhi partakes a unique position after the Sixtyninth Amendment, yet in sum and substance, it remains a Union Territory which is governed by Article 246(4) of the Constitution and to which Parliament, in the exercise of its constituent power, has given the appellation of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent

xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
In the light of the aforesaid analysis and the ruling of the nineJudge Bench in NDMC NDMC v. State of Punjab, (1997) 7 SCC 339 , it is clear as noonday that by no stretch of imagination, NCT of Delhi can be accorded the status of a State under our present constitutional scheme and the status of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is not that of a Governor of a State, rather he remains an Administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
Authored by Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 On 1051963, the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 was enacted.	Arguments of Respondent
The 1963 Act defined the expression Administrator in Section 2(1)(a) as 2.	Arguments of Respondent
(1)(a) Administrator means the administrator of a Union Territory appointed by the President under Article 239 Section 3 provided for a Legislative Assembly.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 18 provided for the extent of legislative power in the following terms Extent of legislative power.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory may make laws for the whole or any part of the Union Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution insofar as any such matter is applicable in relation to Union Territories.	Arguments of Respondent
Nothing in subsection (1) shall derogate from the powers conferred on Parliament by the Constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for the Union Territory or any part thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
Subsection (1) of Section 18 was similar in language to Article 239AA(3)(a), without the exclusion of matters relating to Entries 1, 2 and 18 and Entries 64, 65 and 66.	None
Subsection (2) was similar in language to Article 239AA(3)(b).	Arguments of Respondent
Section 21 provided that if there was any inconsistency between a law made by Parliament and a law made by the Legislative Assembly, the law made by Parliament would prevail to the extent of repugnancy this provision is similar in nature to Article 239AA(3)(c).	Arguments of Respondent
The judgment of the majority also holds that all Union Territories are not situated alike.	Arguments of Respondent
The first category consists of Union Territories which have no legislature at all.	Arguments of Respondent
The second category has legislatures created by a law enacted by Parliament under the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963.	Arguments of Respondent
The third category is Delhi which has special features under Article 239AA.	Arguments of Respondent
Though the Union Territory of Delhi is in a class by itself, it is certainly not a State within the meaning of Article 246 or Part VI of the Constitution .	Arguments of Respondent
Various Union Territories the Court observed are in different stages of evolution.	Arguments of Respondent
However, the position remains that these Union Territories, including the NCT are yet Union Territories and not a State.	Arguments of Respondent
Authored by Justice Ashok Bhushan After examining the constitutional scheme delineated by Article 239AA, another constitutional principle had been laid down by the Constitution Bench that Union Territories are governed by Article 246(4) notwithstanding their differences in respective setups and Delhi, now called the National Capital Territory of Delhi is yet a Union Territory.	Arguments of Respondent
The Constitution Bench had also recognised that the Union Territory of Delhi is in a class by itself, certainly not a State.	Arguments of Respondent
Legislative power of Parliament was held to cover Union Territories including Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
The submission of the appellants that proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA envisages an extreme and unusual situation and is not meant to be a norm, is substantially correct.	Arguments of Respondent
The exercise of power under the proviso cannot be a routine affair and it is only in cases where the Lieutenant Governor on due consideration of a particular decision of the Council of Ministers Ministers, decides to make a reference so that the decision be not implemented.	Arguments of Respondent
The overall exercise of administration of the Union Territory is conferred on the President, which is clear from the provisions contained in Part VIII of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
Although, it was contended by the appellant that Article 239 is not applicable with regard to NCTD after Article 239AA has been inserted in the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
The above submission cannot be accepted on account of the express provisions which are mentioned under Article 239AA and Article 239AB itself.	Arguments of Respondent
Article 239AA clause (1) itself contemplates that Administrator appointed under Article 239 shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus the Administrator appointed under Article 239 is designated as the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
Article 239AB is also applicable to NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
Article 239AB in turn refers to any apply Article 239.	Arguments of Respondent
The provisions contained in Part VIII of the Constitution have to be looked into in its entirety.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, all the provisions of Part VIII have to be cumulatively read while finding out the intention of the Constitutionmakers, which makes it clear that Article 239 is also applicable to NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
From the above, contention raised is that the necessary and inevitable position which emerges is that when in paragraph 217, 218 and 219, the majority judgment, acknowledged the exclusive Executive jurisdiction of the Union Government in relation to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II (and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1,2 and 18) of the Seventh Schedule, this Court did not and could not have held that exclusive executive jurisdiction vests with the Government of NCT of Delhi in relation to all other entries in List II of the Seventh Schedule.	Arguments of Respondent
On the contrary, argued the appellants, this Court has held the existence and vestige of nonexclusive Executive Jurisdiction in relation to the remaining entries of List II that of List III for NCTD, since this court has categorically held that NCTD is a Union Territory and not a State, Article 239 continues to apply in relation to NCTD and further the same principle of Ram Jawaya Kapur of coextensive executive power with the legislative power of any Government also applies to the Union government in relation to the Union Territory of NCTD.	Arguments of Petitioner
After highlighting the above aspect, submission on behalf of Union of India Lieutenant Governor is that the true and correct scope and interpretation of Article 239AA in relation to NCTD in the entire constitutional scheme (and as laid down in the judgment dated July 04, 2018 passed by the Constitution Bench of this Court including in paras 217, 218 and 219 of the majority judgment), brings into existence the position as tabulated below chart It is also submitted that it is neither compatible nor can the argument coexist that even when the Constitution Bench categorically rejected the contentions of Government of NCTD, including the contention that it is a State and Article 239 would not apply in the case of NCT Delhi, it can still be said that Government of NCTD would possess the exclusive Executive jurisdiction in relation to all Entries in List II (except matters with respect to Entries 1,2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64,65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1,2 and 18) of the Seventh Schedule.	Arguments of Respondent
Such a contention would lead to an anomalous reading of the judgment dated July 04, 2018 passed by the Constitution Bench of this court and would deserve rejection by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further submitted that the intention of Parliament to confer overriding executive powers to the Central Government is evident from the provisions of Section 49 of the 1991 Act which empowers the President to exercise general control and to issue directions to the Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 52 stipulates that all contracts relating to the administration of the Capital are made in exercise of the executive power of the Union and suits and proceedings in connection with the administration can be instituted by or against the Union Government.	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance is placed on paras 86 ad 87 of the opinion authored by Justice D.Y., Chandrachud, which are as under Section 49 establishes the principle of the general control of the President over the Lieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers Relation of Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers to President.	None
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers shall be under the general control of, and comply with such particular directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by the President.	Arguments of Respondent
As an incident of control, the Lieutenant Governor and Council of Ministers must comply with the particular directions issued by the President.	Arguments of Respondent
Such directions are obviously issued on the aid and advice of the Union Council of Ministers.	None
Section 52 stipulates that all contracts relating to the administration of the Capital are made in exercise of the executive power of the Union and suits and proceedings in connection with the administration can be instituted by or against the Union Government.	Arguments of Respondent
This survey of the provisions of the GNCTD Act, 1991 indicates that there is a significant interface between the President and the Lieutenant Governor in matters relating to the administration of the Capital.	Arguments of Respondent
The Lieutenant Governor has been conferred with certain specific powers by the provisions of the Act including, among them, requirements of seeking the prior recommendation of the President to the introduction of financial Bills.	Arguments of Respondent
As we have seen, the Lieutenant Governor has been subjected to a wider obligation to reserve Bills for the consideration of the President and in regard to withholding of his assent to a Bill which has been passed by the Legislative Assembly in comparison with the duties of a Governor of a State.	Arguments of Respondent
Matters such as the presentation of the annual financial statement or supplementary, additional or excess grants require previous sanction of the President.	Arguments of Respondent
The President has been conferred with the power to issue directions in regard to the official language of the National Capital Territory.	Arguments of Respondent
The Lieutenant Governor has been vested with the power to act in his own discretion in matters which fall outside the ambit and power of the Legislative Assembly and which have been delegated to him by the President as well as in regard to those matters where he is required under law to exercise his own discretion or to act in exercise of judicial or quasijudicial functions.	Arguments of Respondent
Rules for the Conduct of Business are framed by the President in relation to the National Capital Territory, including for the allocation of business.	Arguments of Respondent
They would include the procedure to be followed where there is a difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 49, which has a non obstante provision, subjects the Lieutenant Governor and the Council of Ministers to the general control of the President and to such directions as may be issued from time to time.	Arguments of Respondent
Reference is also made to Articles 239AB and 356 of the Constitution of India.	Arguments of Respondent
239AB.	None
Provision in case of failure of constitutional machinery.	Arguments of Respondent
If the President, on receipt of a report from the Lieutenant Governor or otherwise, is satisfied (a) that a situation has arisen in which the administration of the National Capital Territory cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of article 239AA or of any law made in pursuance of that article or (b) that for the proper administration of the National Capital Territory it is necessary or expedient so to do, the President may by order suspend the operation of any provision of article 239AA or of all or any of the provisions of any law made in pursuance of that article for such period and subject to such conditions as may be specified in such law and make such incidental and consequential provisions as may appear to him to be necessary or expedient for administering the National Capital Territory in accordance with the provisions of article 239 and article 239AA.	Arguments of Respondent
Provisions in case of failure of constitutional machinery in State If the President, on receipt of report from the Governor of the State or otherwise, is satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with he provisions of this Constitution, the President may be Proclamation (a) assume to himself all or any of the functions of the Government of the State and all or any of the powers vested in or exercisable by the Governor or any body or authority in the State other than the Legislature of the State (b) declare that the powers of the Legislature of the State shall be exercisable by or under the authority of Parliament (c) make such incidental and consequential provisions as appear to the president to be necessary or desirable for giving effect to the objects of the Proclamation, including provisions for suspending in whole or in part the operation of any provisions of this constitution relating to any body or authority in the State Provided that nothing in this clause shall authorise the President to assume to himself any of the powers vested in or exercisable by a High Court, or to suspend in whole or in part the operation of any provision of this Constitution relating to High Courts On the strength of these provisions it is argued that it is abundantly clear that in the case of States, the Constitution envisages that in a case of failure of constitutional machinery, the President (i.e., the Union Executive) shall assume to himself the functions of the State Government and the powers vested in the Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
However, in the case of Union Territory of Delhi, since the executive power remains vested in the President and there is no independent exclusive vestage of executive power in the Council of Ministers of NCTD there was neither any occasion nor any requirement for the Constitution makers to provide for in the provisions of Article 239AB any assumption of functions by the Union Executive since the executive power vests in the Union Executive itself.	Arguments of Respondent
Since there is never any exclusive vestage in the Council of Ministers of NCT Delhi, there is no need to assume take it back by the President.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, Article 239AB provides that in the case of NCT of Delhi the President can suspend the operation of Article 239AA even in a case where the President i.e. the Union Executive is satisfied that it is necessary to do so for proper administration of NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
In nutshell, submission on behalf of the Union of India is that when the judgment dated July 04, 2018 passed by the Constitution Bench comprising three separate opinions is read as a whole in the manner projected above and there is a harmonization of the three opinions to discern the law which has been laid down by this Court the legal position projected by the respondents gets strengthened.	Arguments of Respondent
As per the appellant, such a reading of the judgment dated July 04, 2018 would also be in consonance with the observation made in para 144 of the opinion authored by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, wherein it has been observed that there is a broad coalescence ( coming together to form one mass or whole process of merger of two or more droplets of particles to become one single droplet ) between the view expressed in the three opinions in the said judgment dated 04.07.2018.	Arguments of Respondent
We may record at this stage that Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate who appeared for the intervenor, Reliance Industries Limited supported the aforesaid stand taken by the Union of India.	Arguments of Respondent
He also submitted that no exclusive executive power has been conferred upon the GNCTD, i.e, to the exclusion of the Central Government.	Arguments of Respondent
He argued that the Scheme behind Article 239AA of the Constitution was hybrid in nature relatable to Lists II and III.	Arguments of Respondent
Detailed submission of Dr. Singhvi in this behalf would be taken note of while dealing with the issue pertaining to ACB.	None
We may point out at this stage that learned senior counsel appearing for the Union of India have also argued, in the alternative, that if the interpretation suggested by them to the aforesaid judgment of the Constitution Bench is not acceptable, the matter needs to be referred to the Constitution Bench again.	Arguments of Respondent
To put it differently, the submission is that if this Bench interprets that the Constitution Bench has held that the executive power conferred upon the GNCTD under Article 239AA of the Constitution is to the exclusion of the power of the Union, then such an interpretation given by the Constitution Bench is contrary to the scheme of Article 239AA.	None
Efforts were made to show as to how such a view (if it is the view of the Constitution Bench) would be contrary to not only the constitutional scheme, but contrary to specific provisions of the GNCTD Act, 1991, particularly Sections 44 as well as Rule 23 of the Transaction of Business Rules.	None
However, we are of the opinion that no such reference to the larger Bench is required and, therefore, we have not reproduced submissions of the learned senior counsel of Union of India on this aspect.	Reasoning
M s. Kapil Sibal, P.C. Chidambaram, Shekhar Naphade and Ms. Indira Jaising argued the matter on behalf of NCTD, appearing in different appeals.	Arguments of Petitioner
Insofar as the aforesaid interpretation suggested by learned counsel appearing for the Union of India is concerned, a strong refutation on behalf of the NCTD is that the judgment, in no uncertain terms, holds that the executive power of NCTD is coextensive with its legislative power.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to them, the Constitution Bench has specifically held that this executive power pertains to all the Entries in List II, (except Entries 1, 2 and 18, which are specifically excluded), as well as all the Entries in the Concurrent List, i.e. List III.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such a power is exclusive which belongs to GNCTD to the exclusion of the Central government.	Arguments of Petitioner
Specific reference was made to the discussion contained in paragraphs 217 to 219 as well as Conclusions (xv), (xvi) and (xvii) of the majority opinion.	Arguments of Petitioner
Attention was also drawn to the discussions contained in paragraphs 174 to 176, 187 and 239 of the said judgment, which have already been reproduced above.	Arguments of Petitioner
45) Expanding the proposition that the Constitution Bench has already held that apart from the three explicitly excluded Entries (i.e. Entries 1, 2 and 18 in List II), the Delhi Assembly and GNCTD have legislative and executive powers over all other Entries in List II and III, it was argued that specific contention of the Union of India to the contrary was clearly repelled by the Constitution Bench.	Arguments of Petitioner
Submission in this behalf was that the majority judgment clearly records the submission of the Central Government in para 38 which reads as under The respondents also contend that although Article 239AA confers on the Legislative Assembly of Delhi the power to legislate with respect to subject matters provided in List II and List III of the Seventh Schedule, yet the said power is limited by the very same Article when it employs the phrase in sofaras any such matter is applicable to Union Territories and also by specifically excluding from the legislative power of the Assembly certain entries as delineated in Article 239AA(3)(a).	Arguments of Petitioner
This restriction, as per the respondents, limits the power of the Legislative Assembly to legislate and this restriction has to be understood in the context of conferment of special status.	Arguments of Petitioner
The above contention is answered specifically in para 214 of the majority judgment of the Constitution Bench, where it is held that the Delhi Assembly has Legislative Power with respect to all matters in the State and Concurrent List except matters with respect to entries which have been explicitly excluded from Article 239AA(3)(a) .	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, the contention of the Union of India was that matters in List II and List III can be excluded in two different ways, explicitly and implicitly, on account of use of the phrase insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories and the Constitution Bench has negated that argument and held that power of the Delhi Assembly and Government spans over all subjects except what has been excluded explicitly.	Arguments of Petitioner
47)	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel also submitted that at least at seven other places, the majority judgment has made it clear that Delhi Assembly Government has Legislative Executive Competence over all subjects except three subjects and as a corollary, the executive power of the Union Government in Delhi is limited to three excluded subjects in List II.	Arguments of Petitioner
These paragraphs are In Para 199, it is observed that executive power of Delhi Government is coterminus with executive power on all but three subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List .	Arguments of Petitioner
(b) In Para 212, it is held that subclause (a) of clause (3) of Article 239AA establishes the power of Delhi Legislative Assembly to enact laws for the NCT of Delhi with respect to matters enumerated in the State List and or Concurrent List except insofar as matters with respect to and which relate to entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List.	Arguments of Petitioner
(c) Again, in Para 217, the Court held that on a conjoint reading of clause 3(a) and clause 4 of Article 239AA, it becomes clear that the Delhi Government has executive power which extends over all but three subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List .	Arguments of Petitioner
(d) To the similar effect are the observation in Para 219 where the Court observed that Executive Power of the Union in respect of NCT of Delhi is confined to the three matters in the State List for which the Legislative Power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly has been excluded under Article 239AA(3)(a) .	Arguments of Petitioner
(e) This is again reiterated in the conclusions contained in Para 277 (xiv), (xv) and (xvi) as under (xiv)	Arguments of Petitioner
The Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has the power to make laws over all those subjects which figure in the concurrent list and all but three excluded subjects, in the State List (xv)	Arguments of Petitioner
The executive power of the Council of Ministers of Delhi spans over all subjects in the Concurrent List and all, but three excluded subjects, in the State list.	Arguments of Petitioner
(xvi)	Arguments of Petitioner
The Union of India has exclusive executive power with respect to the NCT of Delhi relating to the three matters in the State List in respect of which the power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly has been excluded.	Arguments of Petitioner
This submission was sought to be supported from the concurring judgment of Justice Chandrachud (by referring to paras 127 to 130) which holds that the term insofar as any such matter is applicable to a Union Territory in not a terms of exclusion.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similarly, in paras 71 and 72 of the judgment of Justice Bhushan, it has been held that the said phrase is not exclusionary phrase but has been used to facilitate conferment of power on the Delhi Assembly even in respect of entry that begin with the term State .	Arguments of Petitioner
49)	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further submitted that reliance placed by the learned counsel appearing for the Union of India on Balakrishnan Committee report for interpreting the provisions of Article 239AA was totally misconceived inasmuch as that aspect has already been considered in the judgment of the Constitution Bench.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was argued that the Constitution Bench has interpreted the provisions of Articles 239, 239AA and 239AB as they apply to NCT of Delhi based on first principles of constitutionally mandated representative democracy, which is based on popular will.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Constitution Bench has not been constrained by textual limitations in giving the interpretation.	Arguments of Petitioner
This is best stated in Para 11 of the Constitution Bench judgment, the relevant portion of which reads as under In the context of the case at hand, the democratic nature of our Constitution and the paradigm of representative participation are undoubtedly comprised in the spirit of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
While interpreting the provisions of the Constitution, the safe and most sound approach is to read the words of the Constitution in light of the avowed purpose and spirit of the Constitution so that it does not result in an illogical outcome which would have never been the intention of the Constituent Assembly or the Parliament while exercising its constituent power.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, a Constitutional Court, while adhering to the language employed in the provision, should not abandon the concept of the intention, spirit, the holistic approach and the constitutional legitimate expectation which combinedly project a magnificent facet of purposive interpretation.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Court should pose a question to itself whether a straight, literal and textual approach would annihilate the sense of the great living document which is required to be the laser beam to illumine.	Arguments of Petitioner
If the answer is in the affirmative, then the constitutional courts should protect the sense and spirit of the Constitution taking aid of purposive interpretation as that is the solemn duty of the constitutional courts as final arbiters of the Constitution (Emphasis Supplied)	Arguments of Petitioner
Thereafter, in para 15, some portions of the Balakrishnan Committee are extracted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Then, in para 36, the Court notes the argument of the Union of India seeking literal textual interpretation and reliance on Balakrishnan Report.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similar reliance on Balakrishnan Report by the Union of India is noted in para 47.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thereafter, the Constitution Bench from Page 45 to Page 135 has discussed the principles of constitutional interpretation that will be used to interpret Article 239AA.	Arguments of Petitioner
51)	Arguments of Petitioner
In the light of those principles, the Court thereafter has interpreted Article 239AA and its various provisions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Insofar as Balakrishnan Committee Report is concerned, it is not accepted as interpretative tool, as is clear from the following discussion There can be no quarrel about the proposition that the reports of the Committee enacting a legislation can serve as an external aid for construing or understanding the statute.	None
However, in the instant case, as we have elaborately dealt with the meaning to be conferred on the constitutional provision that calls for interpretation, there is no necessity to be guided by the report of the Committee.	Arguments of Petitioner
(Emphasis Supplied)	None
In this context, another submission of the learned counsel for the appellants was that, in fact, respondents were trying to reargue the entire matter and attempt was to impress this Bench to depart from the view taken by the Constitution Bench, which was impermissible having regard to the provisions contained in Article 145(3) of the Constitution and in particular the proviso thereof, which reads as under Article 145(3)	Arguments of Petitioner
The minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for the purpose of hearing any reference under Article 143 shall be five Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any of the provisions of this chapter other than Article 132 consists of less than five Judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the Court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal, such Court shall refer the question for opinion to a Court constituted as required by this clause for the purpose of deciding any case involving such a question and shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion The argument advanced is that after settling the legal position with respect to Article 239AA of the Constitution, the Constitution Bench has referred the matter back to this Bench for deciding individual cases.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Bench was, therefore, to decide these individual issues in conformity with the opinion of the Constitution Bench and, therefore, it was not open to the Union of India to reargue the case.	None
We have considered the aforesaid submissions with deep sense of sincerity, objectivity and also keeping in mind various specific issues that arise for determination in these appeals.	None
Indubitably, NCTD was, and still remains, a Union Territory.	Reasoning
This was held by a nine Judge Bench judgment in the NDMC case, which legal position is reiterated by the Constitution Bench in the instant case as well.	Reasoning
However, in spite of NCTD being a Union Territory, it has been given special constitution status under Article 239AA.	Reasoning
Clause (1) of the said Article creates and recognises such a status.	Reasoning
This status is to accord Legislative Assembly in NCTD with certain powers that are also rcognised in the same provision.	Reasoning
The nature of Legislative Assembly is enumerated in clause (2)(a) of Article 239AA as per which seats in the Assembly are to be filled by the Members chosen by direction election.	Reasoning
In this manner, even when NCTD remains a Union Territory, it is given a different status than other Union Territories in respect of which provisions of Article 239 apply.	Reasoning
It is also different from the status given to Puducherry, another Union Territory which is governed by Article 239A of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Even for the Union Territory of Puducherry, provision is made for creation of Legislative Assembly.	Reasoning
Such a power is given to the Parliament to enact this kind of law.	Reasoning
In exercise of that power, the Parliament has enacted an Act which creates a Legislative Assembly which is partly elected and partly nominated.	Reasoning
In contrast, conferment of status upon NCTD is by the Constitution itself and is not left to the Parliament.	Reasoning
At the same time, NCTD remains a Union Territory and is not elevated to the status of a State governed by Part VI of the Constitution (Articles 152 to 237).	Reasoning
Thus, with the creation of Legislative Assembly as well as elected Government and conferment of all legislative and executive powers, concept of federalism has been incorporated in Article 239AA.	Reasoning
Article 239AA has been interpreted by the Constitution Bench keeping in view this principle of federalism.	Reasoning
All these aspects have been kept in view by the Constitution Bench while deciding the status of the NCTD as well as conferment of legislative and executive powers to the Legislative Assembly and GNCTD respectively.	Reasoning
The CB judgment, therefore, has to be read keeping in view all these parameters as well as the constitutional principles adopted in interpreting Article 239AA.	None
Insofar as legislative power of the NCTD is concerned, there is no dispute that it extends to all the subject matters contained in various Entries of List II with the specific exclusion of Entries 1, 2 and 18.	None
Likewise, it extends to all the Entries in the Concurrent List, i.e. List III.	Reasoning
At the same time, it is also an undisputed fact that power of the Parliament to legislate on any subject matter contained in List II is not excluded.	Reasoning
In fact, in respect of Union Territories, it is the Union, i.e. the Parliament, which has the power to legislate on all subjects contained in List II and List III.	Reasoning
However, there is a conferment of such legislative power upon the Legislative Assembly of NCTD as well.	Reasoning
This power is specifically conferred upon the Legislative Assembly under subclause (a) of Article 239AA(3).	Reasoning
Subclause (b) thereof, in no uncertain terms, provides that conferment of powers upon Delhi Legislative Assembly under subclause (a) shall not derogate the powers of Parliament under the Constitution to make laws in with respect to any matter for a Union Territory or any part thereof.	Reasoning
This subclause, therefore, retains the supremacy of Parliament to make laws.	Reasoning
What follows is that Parliament has not only concurrent power in respect of List III, but in respect of List II as well.	Reasoning
Insofar as Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II are concerned, the Parliament retains its exclusive domain on those subject matters.	Reasoning
To this extent, there is a departure from the principle of fedaralism inasmuch as Parliament has no power to make any laws in respect of the States for the matters enumerated in List II.	Reasoning
Subclause (c) of clause (3) of Article 239AA takes care of the situation of repugnancy if it arises between the law made by the Parliament and the Legislative Assembly of NCTD.	Reasoning
In that event, the law made by Parliament shall prevail and the law made by Delhi Legislative Assembly, shall, to the extent of repugnancy, be void.	Reasoning
First proviso to subclause (c), however, saves law made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi if law made by it has been reserved for the consideration of President and has received his assent.	Reasoning
In that event, such law made by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi shall prevail in NCTD.	Reasoning
Notwithstanding, second proviso thereto recognises the supremacy of the Parliament by giving it power to enact law with respect to same subject matter as the law made by the Delhi Legislative Assembly and it includes power to make law adding to, amending, varying or even repealing the law made by the Legislative Assembly.	None
As mentioned earlier, insofar as this power of Parliament to make laws in respect of NCTD is concerned, there is no quarrel.	Reasoning
In this conspectus, we have to find as to whether the CB Judgment held that insofar as the executive power of GNCTD is concerned, it is to the exclusion of the Centre, or, as contended by the learned senior counsel appearing for the Union of India, such executive power given to Delhi Government is coextensive with that of Central Government.	Reasoning
It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the observations of the Constitution Bench, particularly the majority view, have to be discerned and given an appropriate meaning.	Reasoning
Undoubtedly, the majority judgment in the Constitution Bench decides that the executive power of GNCTD is coextensive with legislative power and it extends over all the subjects of the lis to accept subjects mentioned in Entries 1, 2 and 18 and it also extends to all subjects in List III.	Reasoning
This is the clear mandate of the Constitution Bench.	Reasoning
The controversy, however, is on the issue as to whether such executive power of GNCTD is to the exclusion of the power of the Union Government.	Reasoning
In this behalf, it may be noted that the majority judgment has held that such executive power of the Delhi Government is to the exclusion of the executive power of the Union.	Reasoning
On the other hand, in a separate judgment rendered by one of us (Ashok Bhushan, J.), it has been clearly held that the executive power of the Union Government is coextensive with that of the Delhi Government.	Reasoning
Discussion on this aspect, in the opinion of Ashok Bhushan, J., goes as under The appellant relying on Article 73 of the Constitution had submitted that Article 73 lays down the principle that while there may exist under the Constitution concurrent legislative powers on two different federal units, there can never be any concurrent executive powers.	None
It was further submitted that the above principle equally applies to matters listed in List II and List III of the Constitution of India for NCTD.	None
Referring to Article 239AA(3)(b), it is contended that the said provision confers power on Parliament to enact legislations in matters in both State List and Concurrent Lists Such power is also available under Article 246.	None
However, it does not follow from the above that the said provision also confers executive powers in relation to matters in the State List and Concurrent List.	None
It is further submitted that Parliament may by law confer executive powers in relation to matters in the Concurrent List on the Union Government for States, it may also do so in relation to NCTD.	None
But, if such thing is not done, the Union Government will, as a general rule, have no executive powers in respect of matters under List II (except the excluded entries) and it is the GNCTD, which shall enjoy exclusive executive powers.	None
We are of the view that the above interpretation as put up by the appellant on constitutional provisions cannot be accepted.	None
The principle is well established that executive powers coexist with the legislative powers.	None
Reference to Article 73 has been made in this context, which need to be noted.	None
Article 73 provides as follows Extent of executive power of the Union.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of the Union shall extend (a) to the matters with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws and (b) to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by the Government of India by virtue of any treaty or agreement Provided that the executive power referred to in subclause (a) shall not, save as expressly provided in this Constitution or in any law made by Parliament, extend in any State to matters with respect to which the legislature of the State has also power to make laws.	None
Until otherwise provided by Parliament, a State and any officer or authority of a State may, notwithstanding anything in this Article, continue to exercise in matters with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws for that State such executive power or functions as the State or officer or authority thereof could exercise immediately before the commencement of this Constitution.	None
The proviso to Article 73(1) provides that the executive power referred to in subclause (a) shall not, save as expressly provided in this Constitution or in any law made by Parliament, extend in any State to matters with respect to which the legislature of the State has also power to make laws.	None
Obviously, the proviso refers to the Concurrent List where both Parliament and State have power to make laws.	None
Executive power in reference to Concurrent List has been deliberately excluded to avoid any duplicacy in exercise of power by two authorities.	None
Article 73 as it stood prior to the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 contained the expression after the word State specified in Part A or Part B of the First Schedule .	None
Thus, the executive power was excluded of the Union only with regard to Part A and Part B States alone.	Reasoning
Thus, when the Constitution was enforced, executive power of Union in reference to Part C States was not excluded with regard to Concurrent List also.	Reasoning
Part C States having been substituted as now by the Union Territories by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act.	Reasoning
The word State in proviso to Article 73 cannot be read to include Union Territory.	Reasoning
Reading the words Union Territory within the word State in proviso to Article 73(1) shall not be in accordance with Scheme of Part VIII (Union Territories) of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Union Territories are administered by the President.	Reasoning
Exercise of executive power of the Union through President is an accepted principle with regard to Union Territories.	Reasoning
The above interpretation is also reinforced due to another reason.	Reasoning
Under Article 239AA(4) proviso, the Lieutenant Governor, in case of difference of opinion, can make a reference to the President for decision and has to act according to the decision given thereon.	Reasoning
The President, thus, with regard to a particular executive action, which has been referred, has exclusive jurisdiction to take a decision, which both Council of Ministers as well as Lieutenant Governor has to follow.	Reasoning
The provision does not indicate that power of the President is confined only to executive actions which are mentioned in List II.	Reasoning
When the President, as provided by the constitutional scheme, is entitled to take executive decision on any matter irrespective of the fact whether such executive decision taken by the Council of Ministers or Ministers related to matters covered by List II and List III, the executive power to Union through President cannot be confined to List II.	Reasoning
Overriding power to the Union even on the executive matters has to be conceded to be there as per constitutional scheme.	Reasoning
It is another matter that for exercise of executive powers by the Union through the President and by the Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister of NCTD, the Constitution itself indicates a scheme which advances the constitutional objectives and provide a mechanism for exercise of executive powers, which aspect shall be, however, further elaborated while considering clause (4) of Article 239AA.	Reasoning
Legislative power of the Union is coextensive with its executive power in relation to NCT is further indicated by the provisions of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991.	Reasoning
The insertion of Article 239AA by the Constitution Sixtyninth Amendment has been followed by enactment of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 which Act was enacted by Parliament in exercise of power under Article 239AA(7)(a) of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Section 49 of the Act, 1991 provides as follows Relation of Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers to President.	None
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers shall be under the general control of, and comply with such particular directions, if any, as may from time to time be given by the President.86.	Arguments of Respondent
Legislative power of the Union is exercised by the President as per the constitutional scheme and Section 49 itself indicates that Parliament clearly envisaged the Council of Ministers and the Lieutenant Governor shall be under the general control of, and comply with such particular directions issued by the President from time to time.	Reasoning
The power of the President to issue direction is not limited in any manner so as to put any restriction on the executive power of the Union.	Reasoning
The President further is empowered under Section 44 of the 1991 Act to make rules for the allocation of business to the Ministers insofar as it is business with respect to which the Lieutenant Governor is required to act on the aid and advice of his Council of Ministers.	Reasoning
As per Article 239AA subclause (4) read with business rules, the manner and procedure of conduct of business including executive functions of GNCTD has to be administered.	Reasoning
Although the Union ordinarily does not interfere with or meddle with the daytoday functions of the GNCTD which is in tune with the constitutional scheme as delineated by Article 239AA and to give meaning and purpose to the Cabinet form of Government brought in place in the National Capital of Territory.	Reasoning
But as the overriding legislative power of Parliament is conceded in the constitutional scheme, overriding executive power has also to be conceded even though such power is not exercised by the Union in the daytoday functioning of the GNCTD.	Reasoning
We thus conclude that executive power of the Union is coextensive on all subjects referable to List I and List II on which Council of Ministers and NCTD has also executive powers.	Reasoning
Insofar as opinion of Chandrachud, J. is concerned, there is no categorical discussion on this aspect, though insofar as legislative power of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi is concerned, that has been recognised, which is in conformity with the other two opinions, the aspect of executive power of the Delhi Government has not been elaborated.	Reasoning
Instead, there is a detailed discussion on the construction of the proviso to Article 239AA(4).	Reasoning
As we have seen, clause (4) deals with the executive power of the Council of Ministers of GNCTD.	Reasoning
Proviso thereto deals with the situation where there would be a difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any matter.	Reasoning
It provides that in such an eventuality the Lieutenant Governor is supposed to refer the matter to the President for decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the President.	Reasoning
It gives supremacy to the President in the matter of executive decisions.	Reasoning
Chandrachud, J. has noted that NCTD continues to be a Union Territory and the Union Government has a special interest in the administration of its affairs, which stands exemplified by the provisions of Article 239 and Section 49 of the GNCTD Act.	Reasoning
Therefore, the provision to Article 239AA(4) must be given an interpretation which is marked with a sense of fine constitutional balance.	Reasoning
The balance which is drawn must preserve the vital interest of the Union Government in the governance of the National Capital while supporting the legitimacy and constitutional status of the Council of Minister, which owes collective responsibility to the Legislative Assembly and which, in its capacity of the executive arm of the Government, tenders aid and advise to the Lieutenant Governor under a cabinet form of governance.	Reasoning
According to the learned Judge, three lines of reasoning emerge in this behalf which are mentioned in the opinion.	Reasoning
The first line of interpretation would have the Court interpret the expression difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Council of Ministers on any of the matter without reservation or qualification, which would be a purely literal or textual construction.	Reasoning
In this sense any matter would mean any matter without restriction.	Reasoning
Second interpretation would be to read the aforesaid expression to be read and confined to specific categories.	Reasoning
Third interpretation has two facets.	Reasoning
As per the first facet, a reference can be made to the President only after the Lieutenant Governor has made an effort to resolve a difference with a Minister or with Council of Ministers by seeking a resolution through dialogue and discussion.	Reasoning
This is to be done after following the procedure contained in the Transaction of Business Rules.	Reasoning
Second facet relates to the substantive meaning of the expression any matter, which would not mean every matter or every trifling matter but only those rare and exceptional matters where the difference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territory that it deserves to be escalated to the President.	Reasoning
After suggesting the aforesaid three lines of interpretations, the judgment suggests that there is a kernel of substance in each of them, but pitfalls have to be avoided.	Reasoning
It emphasises that the functioning of the institutions must establish a constitutional balance which facilitates cooperative governance.	Reasoning
Read in this way, the proviso has to be operated and applied in a manner which facilitates and does not obstruct the governance of NCTD.	Reasoning
This judgment, thereafter, again emphasises that though Delhi has a special status, it continues to be a Union Territory.	Reasoning
In that context, the nine Judge Bench decision in NDMC as well as the scheme contained in Article 239 and 239AA as well as the principle of repugnancy mentioned in Article 254 of the Constitution are discussed.	None
Discussion thereafter would be of some relevance and is, therefore, reproduced below, verbatim 138The principle of repugnancy which Article 254 recognises between the Union and State legislation on matters in the Concurrent List is extended by Article 239AA (3)(b) and (3)(c), both with reference to State and Concurrent List subjects for NCT.	None
Moreover, certain subjects have been expressly carved out from the ambit of the legislative authority of the Legislative Assembly and vested exclusively in Parliament.	None
Executive powers of the Government of NCT being coextensive with legislative powers, the aid and advice which is tendered to the Lieutenant Governor by the Council of Ministers is confined to those areas which do not lie outside the purview of legislative powers.	None
These provisions demonstrate that while adopting the institutions of a Cabinet form of Government, the Constitution has, for NCT, curtailed the ambit of the legislative and executive powers, consistent with its status as a Union Territory.	None
The exercise of the constituent power to introduce Article 239AA was cognizant of the necessity to protect national interests inherent in the governance of a National Capital.	None
A sense of permanence and stability was sought to be attributed to the arrangements made for governing Delhi by bringing in a constitutional amendment.	None
Both in terms of the reach of the legislative power, as well as in relation to the exercise of executive power, the special constitutional arrangements for Delhi recognise that the governance of Delhi implicates a sense of national interest.	None
When matters of national interest arise, they would predicate a predominant role for institutions of national governance.	None
Consistent with the need to preserve national interest, it would not be appropriate to restrict the ambit of the proviso to Article 239AA(4) to situations where the action of the Government is ultra vires the limits of its executive powers.	None
This becomes evident on a construction of the provisions of Section 41(1)(i) and Section 44(1)(a) of the GNCTD Act.	None
Clause (i) of Section 41(1) enables the Lieutenant Governor to act in his discretion on a matter which falls outside the purview of the powers conferred on the Legislative Assembly but in respect of which powers or functions are entrusted or delegated to him by the President.	Arguments of Respondent
Under Section 44(1)(a), Rules of Business are made on matters on which the Lieutenant Governor is required to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	None
Section 44(1)(a) covers business which is not a part of Section 41(1)(i).	None
This is because matters which fall within Section 44(1)(i) are not governed by the principle of aid and advice.	None
There is much to be said for not laying down an exhaustive catalogue of situations to which the proviso applies.	None
Governance involves complexities.	None
In the very nature of things, it would not be possible for a court delivering judgment in the context of the problems of the day to anticipate situations which may arise in future.	None
It would be unsafe to confine a constitutional provision to stated categories which may affect the resilience of the Constitution to deal with unforeseen situations.	None
Some of the illustrations which may warrant the exercise of the power under the proviso may shed light on the purpose of the proviso and the object which it seeks to achieve.	None
There are two constitutional perspectives first, the operation of the proviso should preserve the national concerns underlying the conferment of such a power, and second, the exercise of the power under the proviso must not destroy the essential democratic values recognised in Article 239AA.	None
Thus, it is necessary to lay down the steps which need to be adopted before recourse is taken to the proviso.	None
The Transaction of Business Rules indicate in sufficiently elaborate terms that when there is a difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and a Minister, primarily, an effort should be made to resolve it by mutual discussion.	None
If this process does not yield a satisfactory result, the matter can be referred to the Council of Ministers with whom an attempt is made to seek a satisfactory solution.	None
It is when these two stages are crossed and a difference still persists that the proviso can be taken recourse to by referring the matter to the President.	None
These stages which are enunciated in the Transaction of Business Rules must be read in conjunction with the authority conferred by Section 44 of the GNCTD Act which was enacted in pursuance of Article 239AA(7).	None
Hence the proviso must be read in conjunction with the law enacted by Parliament and the Transaction of Business Rules made by the President, to give clarity to the operating procedure for invoking the proviso.	None
Moreover, once a reference is made to the President, the Lieutenant Governor is bound by the decision of the President.	None
The Lieutenant Governor has the authority to take action which is warranted by emergent circumstances until the President has taken a decision.	None
But before recourse is taken to the proviso, the Lieutenant Governor must make every effort with the Minister or, as the case may be, the Council of Ministers to resolve a matter of difference.	None
The nature of the differences which may warrant a reference to the President cannot be exhaustively catalogued.	None
But it would be appropriate to construe the proviso as a protector of national concerns in regard to governance of the NCT.	None
The Lieutenant Governor is a watchdog to protect them.	None
The Lieutenant Governor may, for instance, be justified in seeking recourse to the proviso where the executive act of the Government of the NCT is likely to impede or prejudice the exercise of the executive power of the Union Government.	None
The Lieutenant Governor may similarly consider it necessary to invoke the proviso to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or a law enacted by Parliament.	None
There may well be significant issues of policy which have a bearing on the position of the National Capital Territory as a national Capital.	None
Financial concerns of the Union Government may be implicated in such a manner that it becomes necessary for the Lieutenant Governor to invoke the proviso where a difference of opinion remains unresolved.	None
A situation of the nature indicated in Rule 23 of the Transaction of Business Rules may well justify recourse to the proviso.	None
The touchstone for recourse to the proviso is that the difference of opinion is not a contrived difference.	None
The matter on which a difference has arisen must be substantial and not trifling.	None
In deciding whether to make a reference, the Lieutenant Governor must always bear in mind the latitude which a representative Government possesses to take decisions in areas falling within its executive authority.	None
The Lieutenant Governor must bear in mind that it is not he, but the Council of Ministers which takes substantive decisions and even when he invokes the proviso, the Lieutenant Governor has to abide by the decision of the President.	None
The Lieutenant Governor must also be conscious of the fact that unrestrained recourse to the proviso would virtually transfer the administration of the affairs of the NCT from its Government to the Centre.	None
If the expression any matter were to be read so broadly as to comprehend every matter, the operation of the proviso would transfer decisionmaking away from the Government of the NCT to the Centre.	None
If the proviso were to be so read, it would result in a situation where the President would deal with a reference on every matter, leaving nothing but the husk to the administration of the Union Territory.	None
Article 239AB makes a provision where there is a failure of the constitutional machinery in the Union Territory.	None
The proviso to Article 239AA(4) does not deal with that situation.	None
Hence, in the application of the proviso it would be necessary to bear in mind that the Council of Ministers for the NCT has a constitutionally recognised function, as does the Legislative Assembly to whom the Council is collectively responsible.	None
The role of the Lieutenant Governor is not to supplant this constitutional structure but to make it workable in order to ensure that concerns of a national character which have an innate bearing on the status of Delhi as a national Capital are not bypassed.	None
If these fundamental precepts are borne in mind, the operation of the proviso should pose no difficulty and the intervention of the President could be invoked in appropriate cases where a matter fundamental to the governance to the Union Territory is involved.	None
Insofar as executive power of the GNCTD is concerned, we find that the majority judgment authored by Dipak Misra, CJI (as he then was) clearly holds that it is to the exclusion of the executive power of the Central Government.	Reasoning
That is the effect of the combined reading of paragraphs 214 to 218 of the Constitution judgment.	Reasoning
The argument of the respondents to the contrary is an attempt to reargue the case.	Reasoning
However, judicial discipline prevents us from embarking upon such a journey.	Reasoning
In fact, it is for this reason the learned counsel appearing for the Union of India have also argued that the majority opinion is not correct and matter needs to be referred to the larger Bench for reconsideration.	Reasoning
This course of action would also not be advisable having regard to the provisions of Article 145(3) of the Constitution.	Reasoning
We, thus, have to proceed on the premise that the executive power of the Delhi Government extends to all Entries of List II (except Entries 1, 2 and 18) and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to said Entries 1, 2 and 18 as well as all the Entries in List III.	Reasoning
This power of GNCTD is also to be exclusive, i.e. to the exclusion of the executive power of the Central Government.	Reasoning
At the same time, we may also clarify that while dealing with the specific issues which arise in these appeals, this Court would keep in mind the provisions of GNCTD Act as well as the Transaction of Business Rules inasmuch as for deciding these issues this Court cannot be oblivious of the specific provisions contained in the Act and the Rules.	Reasoning
Of course, while construing those provisions and applying these and other provisions in the context of specific issues, the letter and spirit behind the Constitution Bench judgment on various aspects, to which all the three opinions concur, would be kept in mind.	Reasoning
It is for this reason we have discussed other two opinions as well, in detail.	None
The Appeals To recapitulate, there are a total of nine appeals which have to be decided by this Court in the present batch of appeals.	None
Seven out of these nine appeals have been filed by the GNCTD and remaining two have been filed by the Union of India.	Issue
Eight out of these nine appeals are Civil Appeals and one appeal filed by the Union of India is a Criminal Appeal.	Issue
All the appeals are against the impugned order of the High Court of Delhi dated August 04, 2016.	Issue
The issues which are raised in different appeals are summed up below The first issue is whether the exclusion of Services relatable to Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule from the legislative and executive domain of the NCT of Delhi, vide Notification of the Government of India dated May 21, 2015, is unconstitutional and illegal?	Issue
The second issue is whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the AntiCorruption Branch (ACB) of the NCT of Delhi to investigate offences committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1987 by the officials of Central Government and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of GNCTD alone is legal?	Issue
(These two issues arise in Civil Appeal No. 2357 of 2017).	Issue
The third issue is raised in Civil Appeal Nos. 2358, 2359 and 2360 of 2017.	Issue
In all these three appeals, the common issue is whether the GNCTD is an Appropriate Government under the Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952?	Issue
The fourth issue, which is raised in Civil Appeal 2363 of 2017, is whether under Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and under Section 12 of the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000, the power to issue directions with the State Commission is with the Government of NCT of Delhi?	Issue
Similar issue is the subject matter of Civil Appeal 2361 of 2017, viz.	Issue
whether the orders of the GNCTD nominating Directors to Distribution Companies in Delhi under the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 read with Delhi Electricity Reforms (Transfer Scheme) Rules, 2001, without obtaining the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor are valid?	Issue
The fifth issue is common to Civil Appeal No. 2362 of 2017 filed by the GNCTD and Civil Appeal No. 2364 of 2017 filed by Union of India, wherein the issue is whether the Revenue Department of the GNCTD has the power to revise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899?	Issue
The sixth issue, which is the subject matter of Criminal Appeal No. 277 of 2018, pertains to the appointment of Special Public Prosecutors, viz., whether it is the Lieutenant Governor or the GNCTD which has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor under Section 24 of the Cr.PC.?	Issue
Discussion and Conclusions on the Issues Raised We now proceed to decide these issues.	None
Issue No.1 Whether the exclusion of Services relatable to Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule from the legislative and executive domain of the NCTD, vide Notification dated May 21, 2015, is unconstitutional and illegal?	Reasoning
Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule reads as under State public services State Public Service Commission.	None
Mr. Chidambaram, learned senior counsel who argued the case on behalf of the GNCTD on this issue, submitted that the majority judgment of the Constitution Bench specifically holds that exclusion of legislative executive power in List II for Assembly GNCTD is limited to only three subjects, i.e. Entry 1 (Public order), Entry 2 (Police) and Entry 18 (Land).	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the issue of exclusion of any other additional Entry either in List II or in List III would not arise.	Arguments of Petitioner
As a consequence, not only legislative power of the Assembly, even the coextensive executive power in respect of Entry 41 rests with GNCTD.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Chidambaram argued that Entry 41 has two components, namely, State public service and State Public Service Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
Since there is no State Public Service Commission in Delhi, insofar as service personnel in Delhi are concerned, that would come within the expression State public services	Arguments of Petitioner
and it is the GNCTD which would exercise its administrative power over such employees.	Arguments of Petitioner
73) Learned counsel drew attention of this Court to the earlier Notification dated September 24, 1998 and submitted that the said Notification was perfectly in order.	Arguments of Petitioner

In pursuance of the powers conferred under clause (1) of article 239 of the Constitution, the President hereby directs that subject to his control and until further orders, the Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, shall in respect of matters connected with Public Order, Police and Services exercise the powers and discharge the functions of the Central Government, to the extent delegated from time to time to him by the President, in consultation with the Chief Minister of the National Capital Territory of Delhi except in those cases where, for reasons be recorded in writing, he does not consider it expedient to do so.

However, this was superseded vide impugned Notification dated May 21, 2015 which gives power to the Lieutenant Governor in respect of Services as well, in addition to Public Order, Police and Land, which is contrary to the scheme contained in Article 239AA of the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Notification reads as under MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTIFICATION New Delhi, the 21st May, 2015 O. 1368(E).	Arguments of Petitioner
Whereas article 239 of the Constitution provides that every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas article 239AA inserted by the Constitution (Sixtyninth Amendment) Act, 1991 provides that the Union Territory of Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the administrator thereof appointed under article 239 shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor And whereas subclause (a) of clause (3) of article 239AA states that the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for the whole or any part of the National Capital Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List in so far as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18 and whereas Entry 1 relates to Public Order, Entry 2 relates to Police and Entry 18 relates to Land.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas subclause (a) of clause (3) of article 239AA also qualifies the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under this provision, a reference may be made to Entry 41 of the State List which deals with the State Public Services, State Public Service Commission which do not exist in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the Union Territories Cadre consisting of Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service personnel is common to Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Puducherry and States of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Mizoram which is administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs and similarly DANICS and DANIPS are common services catering to the requirement of the Union Territories of Daman Diu, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep including the National Capital Territory of Delhi which is also administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs.	Arguments of Petitioner
As such, it is clear that the National Capital Territory of Delhi does not have its own State Public Services.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, Services will fall within this category.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas it is well established that where there is no legislative power, there is no executive power since executive power is coextensive with legislative power.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas matters relating to Entries 1, 2 18 of the State List being Public Order, Police and Land respectively and Entries 64, 65 66 of that list in so far as they relate to Entries 1, 2 18 as also Services fall outside the purview of Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and consequently the Government of NCT of Delhi will have no executive power in relation to the above and further that power in relation to the aforesaid subjects vests exclusively in the President or his delegate i.e. the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Now, therefore, in accordance with the provisions contained in article 239 and subclause (a) of clause (3) of 239AA, the President hereby directs that  (i) subject to his control and further orders, the Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, shall in respect of matters connected with Public Order, Police, Land and Services as stated hereinabove, exercise the powers and discharge the functions of the Central Government, to the extent delegated to him from time to time by the President.	Arguments of Petitioner
Provided that the Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi may, in his discretion, obtain the views of the Chief Minister of the National Capital Territory of Delhi in regard to the matter of Services wherever he deems it appropriate.	Arguments of Petitioner

Pertinently, this Notification in respect of Services, mentions about Union Territories cadre consisting of Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service personnel.	Reasoning
There is no dispute that this cadre is common to all the Union Territories and Delhi is only one of them.	Reasoning
It is also not in dispute that this cadre is administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs.	Reasoning
The Notification also refers to DANICS and DANIPS, which are again common services catering to the requirement of various Union Territories, including NCTD.	Reasoning
These services are also administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs.	Reasoning
As is clear from the aforesaid Notification, the aforesaid reasons are given therein thereby making these services subject to the control and further orders of the Lieutenant Governor of NCTD.	Reasoning
Submission of Mr. Chidambaram, however, is that being common cadres, which apply to all Union Territories, undoubtedly, the Central Government has the power to allocate the personnel to NCTD as well.	Arguments of Petitioner
Likewise, it is also within the powers of the Central Government to transfer such personnel from one Union Territory to other, which would mean even from NCTD to any other Union Territory.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, that was the only function of the Joint Cadre Authority under the All India Services (Joint Cadre) Rules, 1972 inasmuch as Rule 5(1) therein stipulates to determine the names of the members of All India Services who may be required to serve from time to time in connection with affairs of each of the constituent States and the period or purpose for which their services shall be available to that Government .	Arguments of Petitioner
However, submits the counsel, once particular officers are allocated to NCTD, during their tenure in NCTD, it is within the powers of the GNCTD to assign them to particular departments.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of this submission, he referred to the following Rules The AllIndia Services (Joint Cadre) Rules, 1972 2.	Arguments of Petitioner

Arguments of Petitioner
(c)(ii) A cadre officer, appointed to any post for which the tenure has been so determined, shall hold the minimum tenure as prescribed except in the event of promotion, retirement, deputation outside the State or training exceeding two months.	Arguments of Petitioner

None
Submission was that as per the aforesaid Rules, posting is done by the State Government once the Central Government allocates particular employees to a particular State and since this principle of federalism is accepted and given imprimatur by the Constitution Bench in case of NCTD as well, the aforesaid principle shall equally apply.	Arguments of Petitioner
As per him, the complete scheme which becomes clear from the above is that while it is the Joint Cadre Authority where Delhi has its own separate representative which allocates officers of the AGMUT Cadre to NCT of Delhi, the post to which such officer is posted deputed is determined by the GNCTD.	Arguments of Petitioner
Consequently, if within the GNCTD, the said officer has to be posted from one post to the another, it is the GNCTD alone which has the powers under the Service Rules.	Arguments of Petitioner
This is in consonance with the position that prevails in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Goa which are also members of the Joint Cadre in the AGMUT Cadre and who like the NCTD and unlike other Union Territories have a representative in the Joint Cadre Authority.	Arguments of Petitioner
77)	Arguments of Petitioner
Likewise, insofar as DANICS is concerned, the submission is that under the Delhi, Andaman Nicobar Islands, Lakshasweep, Daman Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli Civil Services Rules, 2003, same consequence follows.	Arguments of Petitioner
Following Rules were referred to Appointment to the Service  All appointment to the Service shall be made by the Appointing Authority to the Junior Administrative GradeI or Junior Administrative GradeII or Selection Grade or Entry Grade of the Service and not against any specific post included in the Service.	Arguments of Petitioner
12.	Arguments of Petitioner
Posting  Every member of the Service allocated to an Administration shall, unless he is appointed to an excadre post, or is otherwise not available for holding a duty post owing to the exigencies of the public service, be posted against a duty post under the Administration by the Administrator concerned.	Arguments of Petitioner
13.	Arguments of Petitioner
Allocation of members of the Service  The Government shall, from time to time, allocate a member of the Service to any Administration for posting in terms of rule 12.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is argued that under the DANICS Rules, as per Rule 2(a) Administration means the GNCTD, as per Rule 2(b) Administrator means the Administrator of NCTD and as per Rule 2(k)	Arguments of Petitioner
Government means the Government of India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, while it is the Government of India that makes an officer available to GNCTD under Rule 13, the posting of that DANICS officer within the NCTD is to be made by the Administrator on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel who argued on behalf of the Union of India on this particular issue, submitted that Entry 41 in List II cannot be applied to the NCTD as the said Entry is confined to State public services and State Public Service Commission.	Arguments of Respondent
Indubitably, there was no Public Service Commission in NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
The other part refers to State Public Services whereas the services in respect of which the impugned Notification dated May 21, 2015 is issued, pertains to other All India Services or combined joint cadre of Union Territories which are not State public services.	Arguments of Respondent
He also argued that certain matters fall within the discretionary powers of the Lieutenant Governor where he does not have to act on the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers of GNCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
This was such a discretionary matter and, therefore, fell outside NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
In the alternative, he submitted that even if the Lieutenant Governor has no discretion, since the subject matter is not covered by Entry 41 of List II, the Lieutenant Governor is not supposed to act on the aid and advise of the Central Government and not that of GNCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
Focusing on the aspect of discretionary power of the Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Sundaram referred to Section 41 of the GNCTD Act which stipulates the matters wherein the Lieutenant Governor can act in his own discretion.	Arguments of Respondent
This provision reads as under Matters in which Lieutenant Governor to act in his discretion The Lieutenant Governor shall act in his discretion in a matter which falls outside the purview of the powers conferred on the legislative Assembly but in respect of which powers or functions are entrusted or delegated to him by the President or in which he is required by or under any law to act in his discretion or to exercise any judicial functions.	Arguments of Respondent
If any question arises as to whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects with the Lieutenant Governor is by or under any law required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Lieutenant Governor thereon shall be final.	Arguments of Respondent
If any questions arises as to whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects with the Lieutenant Governor is by or under any law required by any law to exercise any judicial or quasijudicial functions, the decision of the Lieutenant Governor thereon shall be final.	Arguments of Respondent
According to Mr. Sundaram, discretion was conferred upon the Lieutenant Governor in respect of this subject matter by virtue of clause (i) of subsection (1) of Section 41 as the matter falls outside the purview of the powers conferred on the Legislative Assembly.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, the President was competent to issue Notification dated May 21, 2015 thereby entrusting the powers and functions in respect of Services to the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, this was supported by Rule 46 of the Transaction of Business Rules which reads as under 46.	Arguments of Respondent
(1) With respect to persons serving in connection with the administration of the National Capital Territory, the Lieutenant Governor shall, exercise such powers and perform such functions as may be entrusted to him under the provisions of the rules and orders regulating the conditions of service of such persons or by any other order of the President in consultation with the Chief Minister, if it is so provided under any order issued by the President under article 239 of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
Notwithstanding anything contained in subrule (1) the Lieutenant Governor shall consult the Union Public Service Commission on all matters on which the Commission is required to be consulted under clause (3) of article 320 of the Constitution and in every such case he shall not make any order otherwise than in accordance with the advice of the Union Public Service Commission unless authorised to do so by the Central Government.	Arguments of Respondent
All correspondence with Union Public Service Commission and the Central Government regarding recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving in connection with the administration of National Capital Territory shall be conducted by the Chief Secretary or Secretary of the Department concerned under the direction of the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
Insofar as Notification dated September 24, 1998 is concerned, Mr. Sundaram pointed out that this Notification was issued under Article 239 of the Constitution.	None
In any case, this was also issued by the President and was almost to the same effect as Notification dated May 21, 2015, inasmuch as here also the President had delegated the powers to the Lieutenant Governor in respect of Public order, Police as well as Services.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, all these subjects were put at par.	Arguments of Respondent
The only other requirement specified in the said Notification was that the Lieutenant Governor was to exercise the powers and discharge the functions of the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Minister of the NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
It was only a consultation which would not mean concurrence.	Arguments of Respondent
The Notification dated May 21, 2015 brought about change only in respect of such consultative process, i.e. consultation with the Chief Minister, as being done away with.	Arguments of Respondent
This became necessitated, according to him, because of the problems which the Lieutenant Governor was facing even in undertaking consultations with the Chief Minister.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, now it is entirely within the discretion of the Lieutenant Governor to have the views of the Chief Minister or not.	Arguments of Respondent
To that extent this Notification is only clarification of the earlier Notification dated September 24, 1998 and in substance the legal implications of this Notification were exactly the same as Notification dated September 24, 1998.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel also argued that the Constitution provides for services of the States and services of the Union.	Arguments of Respondent
All Union Territories services are services of the Union, as held in a recent judgment of this Court in Bir Singh v. Delhi Jal Board and Others (2018) 10 SCC 312 .	Arguments of Respondent
For example, in Delhi, IAS, DANICS DASS cadre, as also teachers and doctors, are services of the Union and the recruitment rules have been framed with the approval of the President or of Lieutenant Governor as a nominee of the President.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel also pointed out that Rule 46 of the Transaction of Business Rules, along with the delegation made by the President under Article 239AA of the Constitution from time to time, has always been governing the process of transfer posting of officers working with the GNCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
Fervent plea of Mr. Sundaram was that a just and fair mechanism could be similar to the one which prevailed in earlier years prior to 2015, viz.	Arguments of Respondent
that the transfers and postings of Secretaries, HoDs and other officers in the scale of Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can be done by the Lieutenant Governor and the file submitted to him directly.	Arguments of Respondent
For other levels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed through the Chief Minister to Lieutenant Governor.	Reasoning
In case of difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister, the view of the Lieutenant Governor should prevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs can issue a suitable notification in this regard.	Reasoning
However, for Grade IV, III, II and I DASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where for Grades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by the Secretary (Services) for Grades II and I, the transfers and postings are done by the Chief Secretary.	Reasoning
For greater transparency, a Civil Services Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary (Services) for Grades IV and III officials by the Chief Secretary for Grades II	Reasoning
and I level officers.	Reasoning
The Board can decide on the transfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers.	Reasoning
He also pointed out that for IAS officers, a Civil Services Board headed by the Chief Secretary already exists and the recommendations of the same are being sent to the Lieutenant Governor.	Reasoning
Similar Board can also be formed for DANICS officers.	Reasoning
His suggestion was that similar mechanism of Services Boards can be made for other departments such as Education and Health.	Reasoning
Likewise, the services of the Union Territories being under the Ministry of Home Affairs, an advisory can be given to that Ministry to make these guidelines under the Transaction of Business Rules and to provide consultation by the Lieutenant Governor with the Chief Minister up to certain level of officers.	Reasoning
In rejoinder, Mr. Chidambaram submitted that the aforesaid argument of the Union ignores the judgment of this Court in Union of India v. Prem Kumar Jain and Others (1976) 3 SCC 743 wherein a four Judge Bench of this Court held that the State includes a Union Territory for the purposes of Article 312 of the Constitution in the following manner It follows therefore that, as and from November 1, 1956, when the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, came into force, the President had the power to adapt the laws for the purpose of bringing the provisions of any law in force in India into accord with the provisions of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was under that power that the President issued the Adaptation of Laws (No. 1) Order, 1956, which, as has been shown, substituted a new clause (58) in Section 3 of the General clauses Act providing, inter alia, that the expression State shall, as respects any period after the commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, mean a State specified in the First Schedule to the Constitution and shall include a Union Territory .	Arguments of Petitioner
It cannot be said with any justification that there was anything repugnant in the subject or context to make that definition inapplicable.	Arguments of Petitioner
By virtue of Article 372A(1) of the Constitution, it was that definition of the expression State which had effect from the first day of November, 1956, and the Constitution expressly provided that it could not be questioned in any court of law.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court therefore went wrong in taking a contrary view and in holding that Union territories are not States for purposes of Article 312(1) of the Constitution and the preamble to the Act of 1951 .	Arguments of Petitioner
That was why the High Court erred in holding that the definition of State in the Cadre Rules was ultra vires the All India Services Act, 1951 and the Constitution, and that the Union territories cadre of the service was not common to the Union and the States within the meaning of Article 312(1) of the Constitution, and that the Central Government could not make the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 in consultation with the State Governments as there were no such governments in the Union territories.	Arguments of Petitioner
(emphasis supplied)	None
The above decision has also been noted, with approval, in paragraph 125 in the opinion of Chandrachud J. in the Constitution Bench judgment.	Arguments of Petitioner
From the respective arguments of the parties reproduced above, it becomes clear that following aspects are undisputed The matter pertains to the Services which consists of Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service.	None
Likewise, DANICS and DANIPS are common services catering to the requirement of various Union Territories including NCTD.	Reasoning
These are All India Services and the cadre in question is Union Territory Cadre which is common of all Union Territory and Delhi is one of them.	Reasoning
Therefore the Cadre does not pertain to GNCTD itself.	Reasoning
This cadre is administered by the Central Government through Ministry of Home Affairs.	Reasoning
There is no dispute that insofar as allocation of personnel belonging to the aforesaid services is concerned, it is the Central Government thorough Ministry of Home Affairs which has to pass the necessary orders.	None
Similarly, Central Government is empowered to transfer such personnel from one Union Territory to other.	Arguments of Petitioner
The fulcrum of dispute pertains to the control of GNCTD over these personnel after they are allocated to the NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
As per GNCTD, it has the power to post such work force at different places and the LG is to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	Arguments of Respondent
For this purpose, the executive power is sought to be drawn by virtue of Entry 41 of List II in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.	Reasoning
The submission on behalf of the Union of India is that it comes within the discretionary powers of the LG as the subject matter is not covered by Entry 41 of List II and, therefore, by virtue of Section 41 of GNCTD Act, the LG is empowered to act in his discretion in such a matter.	Reasoning
In the aforesaid backdrop, the first and foremost question is whether services fall outside the purview of legislative assembly of NCTD?	Issue
To put it otherwise, whether Entry 41 of List II does not cover the subject matter?	Issue
Entry 41 of List II deals with State Public Services and State Public Service Commission.	None
It is undisputed that State Public Service Commission does not exist in NCTD.	None
When we are dealing with All India Services and DHANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to mention it as State Public Service.	None
The further issue, however, is to see as to whether it is within the powers of GNCTD to assign such officers to particular departments, once they are allocated to the NCTD by the joint cadre authority.	Issue
As per Rule 2(c) of Indian Administrative Services (Cardre) Rules, 1954, State includes a Union Territory.	None
Rule 7 deals with posting and, inter alia, stipulates that in the case of joint cadre, posting shall be by the State Government concerned.	None
In the context of Article 312 of the Constitution, this Court has held in Prem Kumar Jain that Union Territories are States for the purpose of the said Article.	None
Similar is the position in respect of DANICS.	Reasoning
Rule 11 of DANICS Rules, 2003 empowers Administrator of the administration concerned i.e. Union Territory, to make these postings.	Reasoning
On the other hand, in the context of NCTD, the Administrator, namely, LG is supposed to function in this behalf on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	Reasoning
That is the dicta of Constitution Bench judgment.	Reasoning
Therefore, it becomes equally doubtful as to whether it falls within the discretionary powers of the L.G.	Reasoning
The aforesaid discussion leads to a very peculiar situation.	Reasoning
The appellant has endeavoured to assume the executive power in respect of services by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, which may be doubtful.	Reasoning
That situation may give discretionary powers to the L.G. On the other hand, it also cannot be said that once the manpower is allocated to Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTD should not have any power to deal with such employees, in view of C.B. Judgment.	Reasoning
In such a scenario, and to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers between the LG on the one hand (as representative of the Central Government) and the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, we are of the opinion that for the smooth functioning of the system, it is necessary to carve out a just and fair mechanism.	Reasoning
Therefore, we are inclined to accept the suggestion of Mr. Sundaram in this behalf as recorded above.	Reasoning
In this behalf, we reiterate the position as under The transfers and postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers in the scale of Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can be done by the Lieutenant Governor and the file submitted to him directly.	Reasoning
For other levels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed through the Chief Minister to Lieutenant Governor.	Reasoning
In case of difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister, the view of the Lieutenant Governor should prevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs can issue a suitable notification in this regard.	Reasoning
However, for Grade IV, III, II and I DASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where for Grades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by the Secretary (Services) for Grades II and I, the transfers and postings are done by the Chief Secretary.	Reasoning
For greater transparency, a Civil Services Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary (Services) for Grades IV and III officials by the Chief Secretary for Grades II	Reasoning
and I level officers.	Reasoning
The Board can decide on the transfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers.	Reasoning
He also pointed out that for IAS officers, a Civil Services Board headed by the Chief Secretary already exists and the recommendations of the same are being sent to the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
Similar Board can also be formed for DANICS officers.	Reasoning
His suggestion was that similar mechanism of Services Boards can be made for other departments such as Education and Health.	Reasoning
Likewise, the services of the Union Territories being under the Ministry of Home Affairs, an advisory can be given to that Ministry to make these guidelines under the Transaction of Business Rules and to provide consultation by the Lieutenant Governor with the Chief Minister up to certain level of officers.	Reasoning
We may add that insofar as disciplinary authorities are concerned, the same are already prescribed as per the CCA (CCS) Rules and the Rules applicable for different services including IAS DANICS.	Reasoning
The appointing and disciplinary authority is the President of India, as per the powers delegated by the President from time to time.	Reasoning
Vigilance matters would get covered by the applicable disciplinary rules in terms of officers competent to initiate and take vigilance action.	Reasoning
In the interest of good governance and smooth Governmental function, we expect that efforts will be made by both the Chief Minister as well as the LG for a harmonious working relation.	Reasoning
Issue No.2	None
Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the AntiCorruption Branch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1987 by the officials of the Central Government and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal?	Issue
On this issue, validity of few notifications is in question.	None
It may be mentioned that vide Notification dated August 01, 1986, the Administrator declared ACB of Delhi Administration as a Police Station under Section 2(s) of Cr.P.C. for the purpose of certain corruption related offences under the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.	Arguments of Respondent
As per this notification, the ACB had jurisdiction all over the whole of Union Territory of Delhi .	None
In supersession of this notification vide Notification dated November 08, 1993, the GNCTD through the Lieutenant Governor declared the ACB of NCTD at Old Secretariat as a police station under Section 2(s) of the Cr.P.C. for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.	None
Thereafter, two Notifications dated July 23, 2014 and May 21, 2015 came to be issued by the Central Government as per which the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees of GNCTD only.	None

BY AUTHORITY NEW DELHI, THURSDAY, MAY 21, 2015/ VAISAKHA 31, 1937 MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTIFICATION New Delhi, the 21 st May, 2015 O. 1368(E)	None
Whereas Article 239 of the Constitution provides that every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he things fit, through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas Article 239AA inserted by the Constitution (Sixtyninth Amendment) Act, 1991 provides that the Union Territory of Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the administrator thereof appointed under Article 239 shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas subclause (a) of clause (3) of Article 239AA states that the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for the whole or any pat of the National Capital Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List insofar as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18 and whereas Entry 1 relates to Public Order, Entry 2 relates to Police and Entry 18 relates to Land.	Arguments of Respondent
And whereas subclause (a) of clause (3) of Article 239AA also qualifies the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under this provision, a reference may be made to Entry 41 of the State List which deals with the State Public services, State Public Service Commission which do not exist in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the Union Territories Cadre consisting of Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service personnel is common to Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Puducherry and States of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Mizoram which is administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs and similarly DANICS and DANIPS are common services catering to the requirement of the Union Territories of Daman and Diu, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep including the National Capital Territory of Delhi which is also administered by the Central Government through the Minister of Home Affairs.	Arguments of Petitioner
As such, it is clear that the National Capital Territory of Delhi does not have its own State Public Services.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, Services will fall within this category.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas it is well established that where there is no legislative power, there is no executive power since executive power is coextensive with legislative power.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas matters relating to Entries 1, 2 18 of the State List being Public Order, Police and Land respectively and Entries 64, 65 66 of that list insofar as they relate to Entries 1, 2 18 as also Services fall outside the purview of Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and consequently the Govt. of Nct of Delhi will have no executive power in relation to the above and further that power in relation to the aforesaid subjects vests exclusively in the President or his delegate, i.e. the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Now, therefore, in accordance with the provisions contained in Article 239 and subclause (a) of clause (3) of Article 239AA, the President hereby directs that Subject to his control and further orders, the Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, shall, in respect of matters connected with Public Order, Police, Land and services as stated hereinabove, exercise the powers and discharge the functions of the Central Government to the extent delegated to him from time to time by the President.

The validity of these Notifications is challenged on three grounds First, post the 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the State Government within the meaning of Section 2(s) of Cr.P.C.	Arguments of Petitioner
Second, the impugned notifications create a class of offenders immune from the jurisdiction of ACB, even though they are accused of committing the same offence as other public servants and in the same territory.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such classification is not permissible under the Constitution and has been held to violate Article 14.	Arguments of Petitioner
Third, the notifications have the effect of amending various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 including the definition of Public Servant, which is not permissible.	Arguments of Petitioner
95)	Arguments of Petitioner
It is argued that power under Section 2(s) of Cr.	Arguments of Petitioner
P.C. relates to Criminal Procedure and not Police.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 2(s) of the Cr.P.C. empowers the State Government to notify a Police Station.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, the impugned notifications are issued by the Central Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is argued that post the 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the State Government for the purpose of exercising the powers u s. 2(s) of the Cr.P.C.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that though a cursory reading of the definition of the State Government contained in Section 3(6) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (GC Act) includes the Central Government and makes it a State Government in respect of Delhi for the purpose of exercising power under Section 2(s) of the Cr.P.C., but that is not the correct legal position.	Arguments of Petitioner
The contention is that Section 3(60) of the GC Act containing the definition of the State Government was enacted prior to the 69 th Amendment to the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
Article 239AA and the cognate Articles were inserted amended by the said Constitutional amendment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Pursuant to the aforesaid amendment, the Parliament enacted the GNCTD Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said amendment and the said Act came in force on February 01, 1992.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of the aforesaid change in the Constitution and enactment of the GNCTD Act, the Central Government is not the State Government in respect of territory of Delhi for the purpose of Section 2(s) of Cr.P.C.	Arguments of Petitioner
The power to issue notification under Section 2(s) is now vested with the Delhi Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference is made to Entry 2 of List III of the Seventh Schedule, which reads as under Criminal procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Criminal Procedure at the commencement of this Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is, therefore, submitted that the Legislative Assembly for Delhi has legislative competence in respect of Cr. P.C, which is directly relatable to Entry 2 of List III.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further the Delhi Government has exclusive executive power in respect of criminal procedure, in terms of Para 218 and 219 of the Constitution Bench Judgment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 3(58) of the GC Act defines the expression State.	Arguments of Petitioner
The definition inter alia lays down that the Union Territory is a State.	Arguments of Petitioner
From this, it is sought to be buttressed that it logically follows that any Government which administers affairs of the Union Territory of Delhi is a State Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
97)	Arguments of Petitioner
To support the aforesaid plea, certain judgments are relied upon.	Arguments of Petitioner
In Ukha Kolhe v. State of Maharashtra (1964) 1	Arguments of Petitioner
SCR 926 AIR 1963 SC 1531 , a Constitution Bench of this Court has held as under 18It is true that power to legislate on matters relating to Criminal Procedure and evidence falls within the Third List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the Union Parliament and the State Legislature have concurrent authority in respect of these matters.	Arguments of Petitioner
The expression criminal procedure in the legislative entry includes investigation of offences, and ss.	Arguments of Petitioner
129A and 129B must be regarded as enacted in exercise of the power conferred by Entries 2 and 12 in the Third List.	Arguments of Petitioner
(emphasis supplied) Judgments of some High Courts are also cited.	Arguments of Petitioner
Arguments on this issue, on behalf of the Union, were addressed by Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel.	Arguments of Respondent
His submission was that the entire matter has to be looked into from a historical perspective.	Arguments of Respondent
He, thus, traced the development of establishment of ACB of Delhi Police.	Arguments of Respondent
Historically, ACB of Delhi Police appears to have been constituted in the year 1957.	Arguments of Respondent
On December 6, 1963, the Chief Commissioner Delhi placed it under the control of Chief Secretary, Delhi Administration.	Arguments of Respondent
On May 24, 1965, the Superintendent of Police, ACB was declared to be the head and Drawing and Disbursing Officer (DDO).	Arguments of Respondent
Thereafter, exercising power under Section 5(1), first proviso of PC Act, the administrator of UT, Delhi authorised the inspectors of police serving in ACB to investigate offences under the said Act in the whole of the territory.	Arguments of Respondent
This was reiterated by the order of the Administrator issued on May 19, 1970.	Arguments of Respondent
Additionally, with respect to Section 161, 165 and 165A of IPC power of arrest without warrant was given.	Arguments of Respondent
During the aforementioned period, the police force was governed by the Police Act, 1861, Section 40 of the Punjab Laws Act, 1872 as in force in Delhi and the Bombay Police Act, 1951 as in force in Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
The criminal procedure was governed by the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898.	Arguments of Respondent
The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 came into force w.e.f.	Arguments of Respondent
April 1, 1974 though it was gazetted on January 25, 1974.	Arguments of Respondent
In this context, the President of India issued the notification dated March 20, 1974.	Arguments of Respondent
A series of notifications, beginning from the year 1974, in respect of establishment and functioning of the ACB have been issued by the President and Administrator LG in exercise of powers under Article 239(1) of the Constitution and Section 2(s) Cr.P.C., 1973 read with Delhi Police Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Significantly, notifications issued prior to July 23, 2014 have not been challenged.	Arguments of Respondent
Some of these notifications were issued even before the insertion of Article 239AA (February 01, 1992).	Arguments of Respondent
The first notification was issued by the President on March 20, 1974 in exercise of powers under Article 239(1) of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
The notification directs the Administrators of all UTs other than Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram to exercise, subject to control of the President and until further orders, the powers and functions under Cr.P.C., 1973 as mentioned in the annexed schedule.	Arguments of Respondent
The notification has a condition that the Central Government may itself exercise all or any of those powers and functions if it deems necessary.	Arguments of Respondent
This notification confers powers on the Administrator of UT Delhi to exercise powers under Section 2(s) Cr.P.C., 1973.	Arguments of Respondent
In pursuance of the delegation of powers by the President of India vide notification dated March 20, 1974 and in exercise of powers under Section 2(s) of Cr.P.C., 1973 the Lieutenant Governor declared ACB of Delhi Administration at Tis Hazari, Delhi to be a police station for offences under Section 161 and 165A IPC, and PC Act, 1947 with jurisdiction over whole of UT, Delhi vide notification dated May 20, 1975.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, ACB was established as a police station by Administrator UT Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
Thereafter, the Rules of Procedure for inquiries and investigation by ACB were revised on February 17, 1977.	Arguments of Respondent
Rule 2 declared that all the Rules and Regulations applicable to the Delhi Police are also applicable to the ACB.	Arguments of Respondent
Rule 3 prescribed the functions of ACB.	Arguments of Respondent
Rule 5 mentioned that ACB would be under the direct charge of a Superintendent of Police.	Arguments of Respondent
Rule 15(v) provides that ordinarily no inquiries should be made by ACB in case of Central Government employees.	Arguments of Respondent
The Rules also provided for prosecution sections.	Arguments of Respondent
At this stage, Parliament enacted the Delhi Police Act, 1978 to amend and consolidate the law relating to the Regulation of Police in Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 4 vests superintendence of the Delhi Police in the Administrator appointed under Article 239 of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
It is he who appoints the Commissioner of Police, Additional Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police.	Arguments of Respondent
Vide Sections 10 and 11, the Commissioner of Police constitutes police districts, police subdivisions and specifies the police stations and their limits and extents.	Arguments of Respondent
Each police station is to be under the charge of an Inspector of Police who is appointed by the Additional Commissioner.	Arguments of Respondent
All this is to be done subject to the control of the Administrator and his orders.	Arguments of Respondent
Vide Section 15, the Commissioner of Police distributes duties and the mode of fulfillment of their duties.	Arguments of Respondent
The disciplinary powers vest with the Commissioner of Police who also makes regulations subject to the orders of the Administrator.	Arguments of Respondent
It also covers preservation of public order and peace through provisions under Chapter IV and V.	Arguments of Respondent
The Administrator can make rules under Section 147.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 149 contemplates cessation of old laws regulating police mentioned in Schedule II	Arguments of Respondent
but it preserves the Rules and Standing Orders, appointments made etc. insofar as they are consistent with the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
It also preserves the pending investigation and legal proceedings.	Arguments of Respondent
Vide Section 150 the police force functioning in Delhi was deemed to be the police force constituted under the Delhi Police Act, 1978 with designations mentioned in Schedule III.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted by Mr. Dwivedi that this Act has to be read along with Cr.P.C., 1973.	Arguments of Respondent
Vide notification dated August 1, 1986 issued by the Administrator of UT Delhi it was provided, in supersession of his previous notification dated May 20, 1975, and August 23, 1975 and issued in exercise of powers under Section 2(s) Cr.	Arguments of Respondent
P.C. 1973 read with notification dated March 20, 1974, that ACB Delhi Administration at Tis Hazari, Delhi would be police station in relation to offences under Section 161 to 165A IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 and also attempts, abetment and conspiracies in relation to said offences.	Arguments of Respondent
It was to have jurisdiction over the whole of UT Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
After the enforcement of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 which also omitted Section 161165A of IPC, the LG of NCTD issued notification dated November 08, 1993 in exercise of power under Section 2(s) CRPC read with notification dated March 20, 1974 of GOI.	Arguments of Respondent
This notification provided that ACB of NCT Delhi at Old Secretariat would be police station for offences under the PC Act 1988 and attempts, abetment and conspiracies in relation to or in connection with the said offences and any other offence committed in the course of the same transaction rising out of the same set of facts.	Arguments of Respondent
Its jurisdiction was to be over the whole of NCT Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
This notification was issued after the insertion of Article 239AA in the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
On September 24, 1998, the President issued a notification under Article 239(1) of the Constitution directing that subject to his control and until further orders the LG OF NCT Delhi shall exercise powers and discharge functions of the Central Government, to the extent delegated in respect of matters connected with public order, police and services in consultation with Chief Minister except in those cases where, for reasons to be recorded in writing, he does not consider it expedient to do so.	Arguments of Respondent
After tracing the aforesaid history, Mr. Dwivedi submitted that Notification dated July 23, 2014, which is now impugned, came to be issued by the Central Government to amend the earlier Notification dated November 08, 1993 which was also issued by the Central Government and that too post Article 239AA era.	None
According to him, the object behind issuing this Notification is to implement the guidelines issued by the CVC in respect of the jurisdiction of CBI and ACB.	Arguments of Respondent
It is this position which is restated in another Notification dated May 21, 2015 which has also been challenged by the Delhi Government.	Arguments of Respondent
According to Mr. Dwivedi, an analysis of all the notifications shows that from May 20, 1975 itself the ACB Delhi administration was intended to be a police station for investigating offences in relation to the personnel exercising powers and functions in connection with UT Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
The notification dated August 1, 1986 had also invoked powers under Government of India notification dated March 20, 1974.	Arguments of Respondent
Though the notifications territorially covered the whole of UT Delhi but the context was evidently to deal with corruption in the Administration of UT Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
The nomenclature Anticorruption branch, Delhi administration also indicates the same.	Arguments of Respondent
The subsequent notification dated November 8, 1993 merely made consequential changes on account of P.C. Act 1988 and change in status of administration of Delhi as NCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
What was necessarily implicit in the said notifications was made clear by the subsequent notification dated July 23, 2014 and May 21, 2015 with a view to avoid parallel exercise of powers by CBI and ACB over officers, employees and functionaries of the Central Government.	Arguments of Respondent
This was also recommended by CVC.	Arguments of Respondent
Here it may be noted that while CBI is a police force created under DSPE Act 1946 and ACB is established under Delhi Police Act 1978.	Arguments of Respondent
The establishment of ACB is with respect to Entry 1 and 2 List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution of India.	Arguments of Respondent
The establishment of CBI and its power of investigation falls under Entry 8/ 80 list I of Schedule VII	Arguments of Respondent
whereas the establishment of ACB would be under the Delhi Police Act, 1978.	Arguments of Respondent
He also submitted that Section 5 of PC Act, 1947 and Section of PC Act, 1988 envisage investigations of offences done by CBI Delhi Police.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, Union or Administrator acting under DSPE Act and Delhi Police Act, 1978 can decide which of the two would investigate officers, employees and functionaries of the Central Government.	Arguments of Respondent
In short five parliamentary ActsCr.	Arguments of Respondent
P.C., 1973, PC Act, 1988, DSPE Act, Delhi Police Act, 1978 and CVC Act have to be read together.	Arguments of Respondent
In this hue, Mr. Dwivedis submission was that it now stands established, even by the judgment of the Constitution Bench, that NCTD is still a Union Territory to which Article 239 is applicable, notwithstanding the insertion of Article 239AA.	Arguments of Respondent
He further submitted that admittedly Entry 2 in List II is outside the legislative competence of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi and, therefore, the Delhi Government could not exercise executive authority in respect of this entry.	Arguments of Respondent
Moreover, Entries 8 and 80 of List I are also outside the domain of NCTD over which the Parliament and central executive has the exclusive jurisdiction.	Arguments of Respondent
It is, therefore, open to the Parliament and the Central Government to act in pursuance of Entries 8 and 80 of List I and provide certain exclusive jurisdiction to CBI as regards investigation to be done by it.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Dwivedi accepted that Cr.P.C. involves a field which is covered by Entry 2 List III of Seventh Schedule.	Arguments of Respondent
His submission, however, is that List III is the concurrent field both for the Parliament and the States.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, though the Legislative Assembly of Delhi has legislative competence in respect of matters covered by Entry 2, but it is not exclusive inasmuch as Parliament also has the legislative competence.	Arguments of Respondent
In fact, competence of the Delhi Assembly is subservient to legislative competence of the Parliament.	Arguments of Respondent
Moreover, Parliament had already exercised its legislative power by enacting Cr.P.C.	Arguments of Respondent
comprehensively and exhaustively.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, the field becomes occupied.	Arguments of Respondent
In such circumstances, the legislative competence of NCTD Legislative Assembly would stand eroded, if not denuded, which happens on account of Article 239AA(b)(c) of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
In this scenario, argued the learned counsel, GNCTD can exercise only such executive power as Cr.P.C. confers on it and this conferment should be specific and express.	Arguments of Respondent
Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned senior counsel who appeared for the intervenor Reliance Industries, supported and added to the aforesaid submissions, which would be taken note of in our discussion.	None
After considering the respective submissions, we find force in the arguments advanced by Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi predicated on the historical developments narrated by him, and extracted above.	None
We may also emphasise that the issue is limited, viz., whether ACB is empowered to register cases in respect of Central Government employees as well?	Issue
We find that the challenge laid by the appellant to these Notifications is predicated on Entry 2 of List II.	Reasoning
Even after conferment of the status of quasiState upon Delhi (which though in constitutional term remains Union Territory), Article 239AA (which gives such a status) itself excludes Entry 2 from the domain of NCTD.	Reasoning
Thus, in respect of Police, NCTD does not have either legislative or executive power.	Reasoning
This Court is required to look into the substance of such an exclusion and cannot be guided by hyper technicalities.	Reasoning
Even in the Constitution Bench judgment it has been emphasised time and again, and in fact in all the three opinions of the Honble Judges, that the text of Article 239AA is to be read contextually.	Reasoning
Therefore, what has been specifically denied to GNCTD, it cannot venture to gain that power on such a plea.	None
Dr. Singhvi rightly submitted that it is a settled principle that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broad and liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widest amplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters.	None
A narrow or pedantic reading of the entries has been repeatedly frowned upon.	None
We are of the opinion that the scope of the term Police as occurring in Entry 2 of List II cannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to only constitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold the legislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervision and control over the functioning of the Police so constituted, including by way of issuance of executive directions delineating the powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings sections of the Police.	Reasoning
In essence, the impugned notifications, to the extent they are in the nature of administrative directions to the Police, are directly relatable to Entry 2 of List II and as such squarely within the competent of the Government of India.	Reasoning
Even to the extent the executive power being exercised qua the Police may correspond to the functions of the Police as set out in the Cr.P.C., the nature of the power would not for this reason stand altered or relatable to Entry 2 of List III.	Reasoning
It is not metaphorsis from List II to List III.	Reasoning
In substance, issuance of an administrative executive direction to the Police is an exercise of executive power relatable to the legislative entry pertain to Police.	Reasoning
Additionally, as already noted above, various provisions of the Delhi Police Act, 1978 also demonstrate that power of control and supervision is invested with the Administrator.	Reasoning
This includes defining the limits and extent of the police station and administrative control over police stations.	Reasoning
Moreover, Entry 2 List II would also include the determination as to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police.	Reasoning
Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it would be permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere of the ACB.	Reasoning
No doubt, Section 2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police station by the State Government.	None
However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down the procedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submitting final reports.	Reasoning
It does not contain any provision which prescribes what offences would be investigated by which police force.	Reasoning
Section 156 of the Cr.P.C. merely provides that officers in the police station will investigate those cognizable cases which can be tried by the court having jurisdiction over the local area concerned would have power to inquire into or try.	Reasoning
These provisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two police stations is to be demarcated.	Reasoning
In fact, parallel jurisdiction to investigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C.	Reasoning
as that would result in chaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose of investigation.	Reasoning
This leads us to hold that the Government which has competence over Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcate the jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces.	Reasoning
Hence the impugned notifications are valid.	Reasoning
This conclusion becomes inevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 and other cognate enactments.	Reasoning
Here we have to keep mind the fact that Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereof is public order, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTD and is the exclusive domain of the Parliament Central Executive.	Reasoning
The term public order has been assigned widest amplitude and connotation (See Stainislaus v. State of Madhya Pradesh and Others (1977) 1 SCC 677 and Zameer Ahmed Latifur Rehman Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra and Others (2010) 5 SCC 246 ).	Reasoning
It is also held that public order includes cognizance of offences, search, seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences (FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event of conviction, execution of sentences as well.	Reasoning
All these aspects have to be construed conjointly.	Reasoning
In fact, there was a specific rational in excluding Entries 1, 2 and 18 of List II from the jurisdiction of the Government of NCTD.	Reasoning
The Balakrishnan Committee report which recommended exclusion of these Entries (and which part of the Report stands accepted by providing so specifically in Article 239AA of the Constitution) was of the view that duties and responsibilities pertaining to the Police and maintenance of public order be vested solely in the Central Government so that there is no confusion or overlap of the jurisdiction in regard to the focal point of control and coordination.	Reasoning
This rationale behind the aforesaid exclusion directly flows from the unique position occupied by the NCTD as the nations capital and seat of the Central Government.	Reasoning
Also, the opinion of Chandrachud, J. at paragraph 29 notes that exclusion of inter alia police and public order was a constitutional indication of the fact that the NCT has been considered to be of specific importance from the perspective of the nation to exclude three important areas which have a vital bearing on its status as a national capital .	None
Following observations from the said opinion are also apt The NCT embodies, in its character as a capital city the political symbolism underlying national governance.	None
The circumstances pertaining to the governance of the NCT may have a direct and immediate impact upon the collective welfare of the nation.	None
This is the rationale for exclusion of the subjects of police, public order and land from the legislative power and necessarily from the executive power of the NCT (paragraph 55) xx	None
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx national imperatives have led to the carving out of the areas of police, public order and land from the sphere of legislative authority of the legislative assembly and their entrustment to Parliament (paragraph 74) Pertinently, the appellant wants exclusive executive power in respect of the entries in List II, except Entries 1, 2 and 18, as well as all the subjects over List III.	None
In this behalf, as noted above, contention of the appellant is that the Constitution Bench has so decided.	Reasoning
However, when it comes to excepted matter in Entry 2 List II, though powers of NCTD are totally excluded, by indirect method the appellant wants concurrent jurisdiction over the same.	Reasoning
It would be difficult to accept such a position.	Reasoning
It is also pertinent to mention that insofar as Notification dated November 08, 1993 is concerned, whereby ACB of NCTD at Old Secretariat as police station was created by the Lieutenant Governor, the same has not been challenged.	Reasoning
No doubt, there was no elected Government at that time.	Reasoning
Fact remains that this Notification has held the field even thereafter throughout.	Reasoning
The impugned Notifications are only a modification to the aforesaid Notification dated November 08, 1993 to a limited extent whereby it is clarified that this earlier Notification shall be applicable to the officers and employees of that Government only (GNCTD).	Reasoning
Thus, the only effect is that the ACB is not empowered to investigate into the offences of Central Government employees under the Prevention of Corruption Act.	Reasoning
Admittedly, this investigation is carried out by the CBI.	Reasoning
Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict of jurisdiction as well.	Reasoning
We, thus, uphold the validity of Notifications dated July 23, 2014 and May 21, 2015.	None
Issue No.3 Whether the GNCTD is an appropriate Government under the COI Act?	None
The relevant entries in the Seventh Schedule are Entry 94 of List I and Entry 45 of List III.	None
These are as under Entry 94 List I Inquiries, surveys and statistics for the purpose of any of the matters in this List.	None
Entry 45 List III Inquiries and statistics for the purposes of any of the matters specified in List II or List III.	None
The COI Act is the Central enactment.	None
For understanding the issue involved, we may refer to the definition of appropriate Government contained in Section 2(a) of this Act, which reads as under appropriate Government means the Central Government, in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List I or List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the State Government, in relation to a Commission appointed by it to make an inquiry into any matter relatable to any of the entries enumerated in List II or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution (emphasis supplied)	None
As per Mr. Naphade, clause (I) of subsection (a) of Section 2 relates to both the Entries, namely, Entry 91 of List I and Entry 45 of List III, whereas clause (ii) is relatable to Entry 45 of List III.	Arguments of Petitioner
Argument is that since Entry 45 of List III steps in and in respect of this Entry NCTD has both legislative and executive competence, it would be an appropriate Government for the purposes of the COI Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Naphade also referred to proviso (a) to Section 3 which, according to him, is the provision made to avoid any conflict.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is as under (a) by the Central Government, no State Government shall, except with the approval of the Central Government, appoint another Commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the Commission appointed by the Central Government is functioning Mr. Naphade submitted that while holding that the State Government in the above definition of appropriate Government does not include the Government of NCT of Delhi, the High Court has applied the definition of State Government under Section 3(60) of the GC Act and this is another issue where the said definition has been mechanically applied, without understanding the context or text of the enactment.	Arguments of Petitioner
120)	Arguments of Petitioner
In respect of this issue, the High Court has held that In the light of the clear and unambiguous definitions of the Central Government and State Government under Section 3(8) and Section 3(60) respectively of the GC Act, we are of the view that the expression appropriate Government in respect of Union Territories shall be the Central Government only and further held that even if GNCTD is appropriate government, that the impugned notification appointing the Commission of Enquiry could not be sustained as the same was passed without seeking views concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was argued that as far as the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor is concerned, it has already been held by the Constitution Bench that no concurrence is required.	Arguments of Petitioner
121)	Arguments of Petitioner
Attention was also drawn to the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the original Bill No. 39 of 1952 introduced in Parliament to bring about the enactment the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.	Arguments of Petitioner
It reads as follows Commissions and Committees of Inquiry are at present appointed by Government under executive order there is no central law to regulate the power of such bodies.	Arguments of Petitioner
Some of them have felt handicapped because of the absence of any statutory power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.	Arguments of Petitioner
In order to remove this difficulty, ad hoc legislation has been passed from time to time, such as for example, the Sugar Crisis Inquiring Authority Act, 1950.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is felt that there should be a general law authorizing Government to appoint an inquiring authority on any matter of public importance, whenever considered necessary, or when a demand to that effect is made by the Legislature and that such law should enable the inquiring authority to exercise certain specific powers including the powers to summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath, and to compel persons to furnish information.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Bill is designed to achieve this object.	Arguments of Petitioner
Another submission is that the power to appoint a commission of enquiry generally and even under the COI Act, 1952 is a power incidental to governance as it is a means of a government informing itself of matters of public importance.	Arguments of Petitioner
By its very nature and in the interest of good governance and in principle, such a power cannot be denied to any government.	Arguments of Petitioner
Furthermore, the power to appoint a commission of inquiry, whether dehors the COI Act, 1952 or in terms of the Act is traceable to Entry 45 of List III.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, the power simpliciter to appoint a Commission of Enquiry exists with the Council of Ministers of GNCTD by virtue of Entry 45.	Arguments of Petitioner
The COI Act, 1952 only facilitates and provides the procedure for conducting such an enquiry.	Arguments of Petitioner
It does not make any sense to deny the Government of NCT of Delhi this procedural benefit, when it otherwise has the power to appoint an enquiry under Entry 45 of List III.	Arguments of Petitioner
More so, when the Delhi Assembly can pass a law setting up a commission of inquiry for instance on transport, water resources or primary health centres in order to better inform itself for the formulation of policy.	Arguments of Petitioner
123)	Arguments of Petitioner
On the above basis, it is argued that reliance on Section 3(60) of the GC Act is unsustainable.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court has applied Section 3(60) of the GC Act without understanding the context of appointment of Commission of Inquiries and without appreciating that the COI Act is only a procedural mechanism for exercise of power which exists independent of this Act in the NCT of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
On this subject matter, Mr. Maninder Singh responded to the aforesaid arguments of Mr. Naphade.	Arguments of Respondent
His first submission is that COI Act is a Parliamentary enactment and, therefore, implementation thereof has to be as per the provisions of the said Act.	Arguments of Respondent
He referred to para 12 of the judgment in Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapurs case which reads as under It may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive function means and implies.	None
Ordinarily the executive power connotes the residue of governmental functions that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away.	None
The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the functions of the different parts or branches of the Government have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can very well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate assumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions that essentially belong to another.	Arguments of Respondent
The executive indeed can exercise the powers of departmental or subordinate legislation when such powers are delegated to it by the legislature.	Arguments of Respondent
It can also, when so empowered, exercise judicial functions in a limited way.	None
The executive Government, however, can never go against the provisions of the Constitution or of any law.	Arguments of Respondent
This is clear from the provisions of Article 154 of the Constitution but, as we have already stated, it does not follow from this that in order to enable the executive to function there must be a law already in existence and that the powers of the executive are limited merely to the carrying out of these laws.	Arguments of Respondent
Adverting to the provisions of COI Act, he submitted that Section 2(a) defines appropriate government.	None
According to him, clause 2(i) which defines State Government does not include GNCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Gautam Khazanchi, advocate who appeared on behalf of respondent No. 1 in Civil Appeal No. 2360 of 2017 also supported the stand taken by Mr. Maninder Singh.	Arguments of Respondent
He added to the aforesaid contention by arguing that notification dated August 20, 1996, which gives power to the LG, remains unchanged.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, this notification dated August 20, 1966 is a specific statutory delegation which accorded the status of the competent authority on the LG under the COI Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, it is the administrative of any Union Territory (LG in the case of NCTD) who is competent to exercise the discharge the function of the State Government under this Act.	Arguments of Respondent
This position, he argued, has not changed even after the Constitutional amendment and enacting of GNCTD Act, 1991.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel submitted that in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu Alias Afsan Guru (2005) 11 SCC 600 , one of the arguments raised by the defence was that valid sanction had not been obtained as per Section 196 of the Cr.P.C. in order to prosecute the accused persons.	Arguments of Respondent
However, the Court noted As regards the sanction under Section 196 CrPC it is recited in the sanction order (Ext. P11/2) that the Lieutenant Governor acted in exercise of powers conferred by subsection (1) of Section 196 CrPC read with the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs notification dated 2031974.	Arguments of Respondent
Under that notification, there was delegation of powers to the Lieutenant Governor to grant sanction.	Arguments of Respondent
The said notification which finds place in the annexures to the written submissions made on behalf of Gilani shows that it was issued under Article 239(1) of the Constitution enabling the Administrator of the Union Territory to discharge powers and functions of the State Government under CrPC.	Arguments of Respondent
We accept the submission of the learned Senior Counsel for the State that the delegation of power contained in the said notification will continue to operate unless Parliament by law provides otherwise.	Arguments of Respondent
The Government of NCT of Delhi Act, 1991 does not in any way affect the validity of delegation contained in the presidential notification issued under Article 239.	Arguments of Respondent
He pointed out that this judgment was also placed before the Constitution Bench while considering the proposition that the executive power of the State Government is limited under the Constitutional scheme, even after the enactment of the GNCTD Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Chandrachud, J. opined that The issue as to whether the Lieutenant Governor of the NCT is competent to accord sanction for prosecution under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure was considered by a twoJudge Bench of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 SCC 600 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715 (Navjot Sandhu).	Arguments of Respondent
In that case, sanctions under both the statutes were accorded by order and in the name of the Lieutenant Governor .	Arguments of Respondent
The sanction under Section 50 of POTA was urged to be a nullity on the ground that in relation to the Union Territory only the Central Government was competent to accord it.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 2(1)(h) of POTA defined the expression State in relation to a Union Territory, to mean the Administrator thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
Rejecting the challenge, this Court held that under Article 239AA, the Administrator appointed under Article 239 does not lose his status as such and it is only his designation which is merged into the new designation of Lieutenant Governor in keeping with the upgraded status of this particular Union Territory .	Arguments of Respondent
The Lieutenant Governor, who continues to be an Administrator, was held to derive authority to grant sanction under Section 50 by reason of the legislative fiction under Section 2(1) (h), the Administrator being deemed to be the State Government for the purpose of Section 50.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence (SCC p. 654, para 10) 10.	Arguments of Respondent
by virtue of specific statutory delegation in favour of the Administrator who is constitutionally designated as the Lieutenant Governor as well, the sanction accorded by the said authority is a valid sanction under Section 50 of POTA.The decision in Navjot Sandhu State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 SCC 600 2005 SCC (Cri) 1715 turned upon a specific statutory delegation in favour of the Administrator to grant sanction.	Arguments of Respondent
It is hence of no assistance to the present constitutional context.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel also sought to draw sustenance from Section 41(1)(ii) of the GNCTD Act which states that the LG shall act in his discretion in matters where he is required to, under any law.	Arguments of Respondent
Since the LG is the Appropriate Government under the COI Act, he is bound to exercise his discretion as envisaged under Section 41 of the GNCTD Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The power of the LG to act in his own discretion where he is required to under any law has been affirmed by the Constitution Bench decision.	Arguments of Respondent
In the alternative, and without prejudice to the aforesaid arguments, the learned counsel argued that in any event, the notification dated August 11, 2015 constituting Commission of Inquiry is violative of GNCTD Act and ToBR.	Arguments of Respondent
To buttress this submission, he referred to Section 45 of the GNCTD Act as well as Rule 23 of ToBR as per which every decision taken by the Council of Ministers has to be communicated to the LG to keep him apprised and to enable him to exercise the power conferred upon him under Article 239AA(4) and the proviso thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
Unless the LG is kept informed of all decisions, he cannot exercise the Constitutional power to disagree vested upon him, if need be, and thus, cannot make a reference to the President.	Arguments of Respondent
Another submission of Mr. Gautam Khazanchi was that the notification dated August 11, 2015 was the result of malafide power of the GNCTD.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, the matter had been investigated by the ACB, dealt with by the LG and was also the subject matter of an Inquiry headed by a retired Chief Justice of a High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Initiation of a second round by constitution of Commission of Inquiry to look into the very same allegations investigated by the ACB was not only an abuse of the process but an excess of authority exercised by it to do indirectly what it could not do directly.	None
From the arguments noted above, it becomes apparent that the outcome of this issue hinges upon the meaning that is to be assigned to the expression State Government occurring in Section 2(a) of the COI Act which defines Appropriate Government.	None
To put it otherwise, whether the term State Government would include Union Territory?	Reasoning
For this purpose, one will have to fall back on the GC Act.	None
Section 3(8) of the GC Act defines Central Government and relevant portion thereof is as under Central Government shall (a) (b) in relation to anything done or to be done after the commencement of the Constitution, means the President and shall include (i) (ii) in relation to the administration of a Union Territory, the administrator thereof acting within the scope of the authority given to him under article 239 of the Constitution Section 3(60) of the GC Act, on the other hand, defines State Government, relevant provision whereof is extracted below 3(60) State Government (a) (b) (c) as respects anything done or to be done after the commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, shall mean, in a State, the Governor, and in a Union Territory, the Central Government and shall, in relation to functions entrusted under article 258A of the Constitution to the Government of India, include the Central Government acting within the scope of the authority given to it under that article The GC Act also defines Government, State and Union Territory.	None
We would like to reproduce these definitions as well 3(23) Government or the Government shall include both the Central Government and any State Government 3(58) State (a) (b) as respects any period after such commencement, shall mean a State specified in Schedule I to the Constitution and shall include a Union Territory 3(62A) Union Territory shall mean any Union Territory specified in Schedule I to the Constitution and shall include any other territory comprised within the territory of India but not specified in that Schedule No doubt, definition of State as contained in Section 3(58) includes Union Territory.	None
However, we are concerned with the meaning of State Government which is defined in Section 2(60) of the GC Act.	Reasoning
Here, it is specifically provided that in respect of Union Territory, the State Government would mean the Central Government.	None
It would be appropriate to remark that this aspect had come up for consideration in the case of Goa Sampling Employees Association v. General Superintendence Co. of India (1985) 1 SCC 206 , though in the context of definition of Appropriate Government contained in Section 2(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act.	None
Goa was Union Territory at that point of time.	None
The workman had raised dispute and reference in this respect was made by the Central Government to the industrial tribunal.	None
This power of Central Government to make the reference was challenged by the management taking a specific plea that the Central Government was not the Appropriate Government in relation to the Union Territory.	None
This contention was repelled by the industrial tribunal but upheld by the High Court.	None
High Court had held that the administrator of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman Diu shall be the administrator who could make the reference.	None
This Court set aside the order of the High Court and upheld that of the industrial tribunal holding that Central Government was the Appropriate Government in respect of Union Territory.	None
After referring to the definition of Appropriate Government in Section 2(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Court relied upon the provisions of GC Act contained in Section 3(8) and Section 3(60) thereof.	None
The Court observed that there is a distinction between States and Union Territories and also between State Government and Administration of a Union Territory.	None
It held that the Administration of a Union Territory would not be comprehended in the expression State Government.	None
It was held that the State Government in a Union Territory would mean the Central Government, in terms of Section 3(60) of the GC Act.	None
It would not be constitutionally correct to describe the Administration of a Union Territory as a State Government.	None
This conclusion is arrived at in the following manner Parliament enacted the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 ( 1963 Act for short).	Arguments of Respondent
Its long title reveals the object underlying the enactment, namely, to provide for Legislative Assemblies and Council of Ministers for certain Union Territories and for certain other matters.	None
Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu is governed by the 1963 Act See Section 2(h).	None
The expression Administrator has been defined in Section 2(a) of the 1963 Act to mean the Administrator of a Union Territory appointed by the President under Article 239 .	Arguments of Respondent
Section 18 specifies the extent of legislative power of the Legislative Assembly of a Union Territory to encompass any of the matters enumerated in the State List or the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 44 provides that there shall be a Council of Ministers in each Union Territory with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Administrator in exercise of his functions in relation to matters with respect to which the Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory has power to make laws except insofar as he is required by or under the Act to act in his discretion or by or under any law to exercise any judicial or quasijudicial functions.	None
There is a proviso to Section 44(1) which sheds light on the position of the Administrator and powers of the Council of Ministers.	None
According to the proviso in the event of a difference of opinion between the Administrator and the Ministers on any matter, the Administrator shall refer it to the President for decision given therein by the President etc.	None
Thus the executive power of the Administrator extends to all subjects covered by the legislative power.	None
But in the event of a difference of opinion the President decides the point.	None
When President decides the point, it is the Central Government that decides the point.	None
And that is binding on the Administrator and also the Ministers.	None
Section 45 provides that the Chief Minister of a Union Territory shall be appointed by the President .	None
Section 46 confers power on the President to make rules for the conduct of business.	None
Section 55 provides that all contracts in connection with the administration of a Union Territory are contracts made in the exercise of the executive power of the Union and all suits and proceedings in connection with the administration of a Union Territory shall be instituted by or against the Government of India .	None
In exercise of the power conferred by Article 240, the President has inter alia enacted the Goa, Daman and Diu (Laws) Regulation, 1962.	None
By clause (3) of the regulation, the Acts enumerated in the Schedule appended to the Act were extended to the Goa, Daman and Diu subject to the notifications, if any, specified in the Schedule.	None
The Schedule includes Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 as a whole without any modification.	None
xx xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
Would it be constitutionally correct to describe Administration of a Union Territory as State Government?	None
Article 1 provides that India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States .	None
Subarticle (2) provides that the States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule .	None
Subarticle (3) introduced a dichotomy between the State as understood in the Constitution and the Union Territory when it provides that the territory of India shall comprise (a) the territories of the States and (b) the Union Territories specified in the First Schedule .	None
The provisions of Part VI of the Constitution do not apply to the Union Territories.	None
Part VI of the Constitution which deals with States clearly indicates that the Union Territory is not a State.	None
Therefore, the Union Territory constitutionally speaking is something other than a State.	None
As far as the States are concerned, there has to be a Governor for each State though it would be permissible to appoint the same person as Governor of two or more States.	None
Part VIII provides for administration of Union Territories.	None
Article 239 conferred power on the President for the administration of Union Territories unless otherwise provided by an Act of Parliament.	None
Therefore, apart from the definitions of the expressions Central Government, State Government and Union Territory as enacted in the General Clauses Act, 1897, the Constitution itself makes a distinction between State and its Government called the State Government and Union Territory and the Administration of the Union Territory.	None
Unless otherwise clearly enacted, the expression State will not comprehend Union Territory and the State Government would not comprehend Administration of Union Territory.	None
Now if we recall the definition of three expressions Central Government Section 3(8), State Government Section 3(60) and Union Territory Section 3(62A) in the General Clauses Act, it would unmistakably show that the framers of the Constitution as also the Parliament in enacting these definitions have clearly retained the distinction between State Government and Administration of Union Territory as provided by the Constitution.	None
It is especially made clear in the definition of expression Central Government that in relation to the Administration of a Union Territory, the Administrator thereof acting within the scope of the authority given to him under Article 239 of the Constitution, would be comprehended in the expression Central Government.	None
When this inclusionary part is put in juxtaposition with exclusionary part in the definition of the expression State Government which provides that as respects anything done or to be done after the commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, it shall mean, in a State, the Governor, and in a Union Territory, the Central Government, the difference conceptually speaking between the expression State Government and the Administration of a Union Territory clearly emerges.	None
Therefore, there is no room for doubt that the expression Administration of a Union Territory, Administrator howsoever having been described, would not be comprehended in the expression State Government as used in any enactment.	None
These definitions have been modified to bring them to their present format by Adaptation of Laws (No. 1) Order, 1956.	None
Section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides that in all Central Acts and Regulations made after the commencement of the Act unless there is anythingrepugnant in the subject or context, the words defined therein will have the meaning assigned therein.	None
Indisputably the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is a Central Act enacted after the commencement of the General Clauses Act and the relevant definitions having been recast to meet the constitutional and statutory requirements, the expressions Central Government, State Government and Union Territory must receive the meaning assigned to each in the General Clauses Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context in which it is used.	None
No such repugnancy was brought to our notice.	None
Therefore, these expressions must receive the meaning assigned to them.	None
The High Court after referring to the definitions of the aforementioned three expressions as set out and discussed herein first observed that on a careful reading of the definition, it appears that in relation to the administration of a Union Territory, the Administrator thereof acting within the scope of the authority given to him under Article 239 of the Constitution is the Central Government .	None
So far there is no dispute.	None
The High Court then observed that it must follow that the Administrator is the State Government insofar as the Union Territory is concerned, and it is so provided in the definition of the State Government in Section 3(60) of the General Clauses Act .	None
The High Court fell into an error in interpreting clause (c) of Section 3(60) which upon its true construction would show that in the Union Territory, there is no concept of State Government but wherever the expression State Government is used in relation to the Union Territory, the Central Government would be the State Government.	None
The very concept of State Government in relation to Union Territory is obliterated by the definition.	None
Our attention was, however, drawn to the two decisions of this Court in Satya Dev Bushahri v. Padam Dev AIR 1954 SC 587 1955 SCR 549 1954 SCJ 764 10 ELR 103 and the decision of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Shri Moula Bux AIR 1962 SC 145 (1962) 2	None
SCR 794 (1961) 2 SCJ 549 in which with reference to Part C States, some observations have been made that the authority conferred under Article 239, as it then stood, to administer Part C States has not the effect of converting those States into the Central Government, and that under Article 239 the President occupies in regard to Part C States, a position analogous to that of a Governor in Part A States and of a Rajpramukh in Part B States .	None
It was also observed that though the Part C States are centrally administered under the provisions of Article 239, they do not cease to be States and become merged with the Central Government .	None
It was then urged that by the amendment to Articles 239 and 240 by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956 and introduction of Articles 239A and 239B by the Constitution (Fourteenth Amendment) Act, 1962, only the nomenclature of the Part C States has undergone a change, now being described as Union Territory, but the position of the Union Territory is the same as it was as Part C States and therefore, the view taken in the aforementioned decisions that the administration of Part C States could appropriately be described as State Government would mutatis mutandis apply to the administration of Union Territories.	None
In other words, it was said that they can be appropriately described as State Governments for various purposes.	None
Both the decisions were rendered prior to the amendment of Part VIII of the Constitution in 1956 and the insertion of the Articles 239A and 239B in 1962 and more specifically after the enactment of the 1963 Act.	None
The concept of Union Territory with or without a Legislative Assembly and with or without a Council of Ministers with specified legislative and executive powers have been set out in the 1963 Act.	None
Coupled with this, modifications were made in the definitions of aforementioned three expressions.	None
Therefore, the two decisions are of no assistance in resolution of the present controversy.	None
We may also usefully refer to the opinion of Chandrachud, J. in the Constitution Bench judgment, where the learned Judge has specifically dealt with the aforesaid case of Goa Sampling Employees Association and held that there is no State Government in the Union Territory and the State Government shall mean the Central Government.	None
It is so stated in Para 448 of the opinion which reads as under Dealing with the provisions of Section 44(1) of the 1963 Act, this Court observed thus (Goa Sampling case Goa Sampling Employees Assn. v. General Superintendence Co. of India (P) Ltd., (1985) 1 SCC 206 1985 SCC (LS) 201 , SCC p. 213, para 12)	None
According to the proviso in the event of a difference of opinion between the Administrator and the Ministers on any matter, the Administrator shall refer it to the President for decision given therein by the President, etc.	None
Thus the executive power of the Administrator extends to all subjects covered by the legislative power.	None
But in the event of a difference of opinion the President decides the point.	None
When President decides the point, it is the Central Government that decides the point.	None
The Court noticed that the provisions of Part VI of the Constitution which deal with the States clearly indicate that a Union Territory administration is not a State Government.	None
The Court observed that the Constitution makes a distinction between a State and its Government (called the State Government) on one hand and the Union Territory and its administration on the other hand.	None
This distinction, the Court observed, was carried in the definition contained in the General Clauses Act (SCC p. 214, para 14)	None
Now if we recall the definition of three expressions Central Government Section 3(8), State Government Section 3(60) and Union Territory Section 3(62A) in the General Clauses Act, it would unmistakably show that the Framers of the Constitution as also Parliament in enacting these definitions have clearly retained the distinction between State Government and Administration of Union Territory as provided by the Constitution.	None
It is especially made clear in the definition of expression Central Government that in relation to the Administration of a Union Territory, the Administrator thereof acting within the scope of the authority given to him under Article 239 of the Constitution, would be comprehended in the expression Central Government.	None
When this inclusionary part is put in juxtaposition with exclusionary part in the definition of the expression State Government which provides that as respects anything done or to be done after the commencement of the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, it shall mean, in a State, the Governor, and in a Union Territory, the Central Government, the difference conceptually speaking between the expression State Government and the Administration of a Union Territory clearly emerges.	None
Therefore, there is no room for doubt that the expression Administration of a Union Territory, Administrator howsoever having been described, would not be comprehended in the expression State Government as used in any enactment.	None
The view of the High Court that the Administrator is the State Government insofar as the Union Territory is concerned under Section 3(60) was held to be in error.	None
The decisions in Satya Dev Bushahri Satya Dev Bushahri v. Padam Dev, AIR 1954 SC 587 (1955) 1 SCR 549 and in State of Vindhya Pradesh v. Moula Bux State of Vindhya Pradesh v. Moula Bux, (1962) 2	None
SCR 794 AIR 1962 SC 145 were distinguished since they were rendered prior to the amendment of Part VIII of the Constitution in 1956 and before the insertion of Articles 239A and	None
239B.	None
The position in law was set out as follows (Goa Sampling case Goa Sampling Employees Assn. v. General Superintendence Co. of India (P) Ltd., (1985) 1 SCC 206 1985 SCC (LS) 201 , SCC p. 217, para 17) On a conspectus of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the 1963 Act, it clearly transpires that the concept of State Government is foreign to the administration of Union Territory and Article 239 provides that every Union Territory is to be administered by the President.	None
The President may act through an Administrator appointed by him.	None
Administrator is thus the delegate of the President.	None
His position is wholly different from that of a Governor of a State.	None
Administrator can differ with his Minister and he must then obtain the orders of the President meaning thereby of the Central Government.	None
Therefore, at any rate the Administrator of Union Territory does not qualify for the description of a State Government.	None
Therefore, the Central Government is the appropriate Government.	None
We, therefore, are unable to accept the submission of Mr. Naphade that the expression State Government occurring in Section 2(a) of the COI Act would mean GNCTD, a Union Territory.	Reasoning
It is not for us to deal with the argument of Mr. Naphade that Entry 45 of List III confers legislative and executive competence on GNCTD and, therefore, GNCTD can pass an appropriate order appointing a Commission of Inquiry in exercise of its executive power.	Reasoning
In the instant case, we are concerned with notification dated August 11, 2015 which is passed under the COI Act.	Reasoning
We, therefore, uphold the judgment of the High Court on this aspect.	Reasoning
Issue No.4	None
Whether, under Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and under Section 12 of the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000, the power to issue directions with the State Commission is with the Government of NCT of Delhi?	Issue
On this issue, submissions were made by Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel, on behalf of GNCTD.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the first instance, he referred to Section 108 of the Electricity Act which gives State Government the power to give directions to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SCRC).	Arguments of Petitioner
It reads as under Section 108.	None
(Directions by State Government)	Arguments of Petitioner
(1) In the discharge of its functions, the State Commission shall be guided by such directions in matters of policy involving public interest as the State Government may give to it in writing.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2) If any question arises as to whether any such direction relates to a matter of policy involving public interest, the decision of the State Government thereon shall be final.	Arguments of Petitioner
He pointed out that similar powers are conferred upon the Central Government under Section 107 of the Electricity Act, namely, to give directions to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 (DERC Act), with which we are concerned, contains Section 12 which is exactly on the same terms as Section 108 of the Electricity Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
This provision reads as under Powers of the Government.	None
(1) In the discharge of its functions, the Commission shall be guided by such directions in matters of policy involving public interest as the Government may issue from time to time.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2) If any question arises as to whether any such direction relates to a matter of policy involving public interest, the decision of the Government thereon shall be final.	Arguments of Petitioner
(3) The Government shall be entitled to issue policy directions concerning any subsidy to be allowed for supply of electricity or any other infrastructure services to any class or classes of persons.	Arguments of Petitioner
Provided that the Government shall contribute an amount to compensate the Board or any company affected to the extent of the subsidy granted.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Commission shall determine such amounts, the terms and conditions on which and the time within which such amounts are to be paid by the Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
(4) The Government shall consult the Commission in relation to any proposed legislation or rules concerning any policy direction and may take into account the recommendations made by the Commission.	Arguments of Petitioner
(Emphasis Supplied) Certain definitions which were referred to by Mr. Sibal from DER Act may also be noted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under Section 2(d) of the DER Act, 2000 Government means the Lieutenant Governor referred to in Article 239AA of the Constitution and under Section 2(g) Lieutenant Governor means the Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi appointed by the president under Article 239 read with Article 239AA of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under Section 2(c), Commission means the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission referred in Section 3. 140)	Arguments of Petitioner
His submission on the conjoint reading of the aforesaid definitions was that Government is defined as LG referred to in Article 239AA of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
He argued that Constitution Bench while interpreting Article 239AA has categorically held that LG is to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, and only those matters are excepted where LG has to function in his own discretion, which was not the case here.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, DER Act was passed by Delhi Legislative Assembly.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, even the executive power of the Union will not be there.	Arguments of Petitioner
141)	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sibal referred to the judgment of Constitution Bench in Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix v. Deputy Speaker, Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
(2016) 8 SCC 1 which discusses in detail discretionary power of the Governor under Article 163 of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
This judgment also provides instances of situations wherein Governor may exercise power in his discretion independent of, or, contrary to aid and advice of Council of Ministers.	Arguments of Petitioner
Based on that, Mr. Sibal submitted that exercise of powers under the DER Act does not fall within the domain of discretionary power of the LG and, therefore, he is supposed to act on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.	None
Reply of Mr. Maninder Singh to the aforesaid arguments was that the Electricity Act, 2003 is a Parliamentary enactment which was passed after the insertion of Article 239AA.	Arguments of Respondent
Under Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003, it is the jurisdiction of the State Government to issue any direction to DERC and such State Government, in relation to Union Territory like Delhi, would mean Central Government as per Section 3(60) of the GC Act.	Arguments of Respondent
He also referred to Section 83(1)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003 which makes it clear that for any Union Territory, it would be Central Government which is the Appropriate Government.	Arguments of Respondent
While answering question No. 3 in the context of COI Act, we have held that the expression State Government occurring in Section 2(a) of the said Act which defines Appropriate Government would not include GNCTD.	Reasoning
That conclusion is arrived at while interpreting the provisions of Section 2(a) of the COI Act.	None
However, here we are concerned with the Electricity Act, 2003 which also defines Appropriate Government.	None
Section 2(5) thereof reads as under Appropriate Government means, (a) the Central Government, in respect of a generating company wholly or partly owned by it in relation to any interState generation, transmission, trading or supply of electricity and with respect to any mines, oilfields, railways, national highways, airports, telegraphs, broadcasting stations and any works of defence, dockyard, nuclear power installations in respect of the National Load Despatch Centre and Regional Load Despatch Centre in relation to any works or electric installation belonging to it or under its control (b) in any other case, the State Government having jurisdiction under this Act As can be seen from clause (b) above, Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdiction under this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domain of Central Government.	None
This definition contained in Section 2(5) of the Electricity Act is materially different from definition of Appropriate Government in Section 2(a) of the COI Act.	None
Another important and distinguishing aspect is that in respect of Delhi, the DER Act has also been enacted by the State Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi to which President has accorded his consent.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under this Act, Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has been established to exercise the powers conferred on, and to perform the functions assigned to it under the said Act.	None
It acts as a quasijudicial body which is clear from Section 10 of the DER Act.	None
Section 11 stipulates various functions which DERC is supposed to perform which include determination of tariff for electricity, wholesale, bulk, grid or retail, as the case may be and to determine the tariff payable for the use of transmission facility etc.	None
In essence, such powers are almost the same powers which are given to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).	None
Thus, insofar as NCTD is concerned, it has its own Commission, namely, DERC.	None
DER Act also stipulates powers of Government in Part IV thereof.	None
General powers of the Government, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC in matters of policy involving public interest, as the Government may issue from time to time.	None
These powers are akin to the powers given under Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003.	None
Government is defined in Section 2(d) of DER Act as under 2(d) Government means the Lieutenant Governor referred to in article 239AA of the Constitution Reading the aforesaid definition in the context of the Constitution Bench judgment would clearly mean that LG here has to act on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers, as such functions do not come within his discretionary powers.	None
What follows from the aforesaid is that insofar as DER Act is concerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly of NCTD.	None
It operates within the NCTD.	Reasoning
Government here means GNCTD i.e. LG who is supposed to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	Reasoning
Under this Act, Delhi Government has power to issue directions to the DERC in matters of policies involving public interest.	Reasoning
When such powers are conferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannot be said that insofar as Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned, the expression State Government therein would mean the Central Government.	Reasoning
If such an interpretation is given, there would clearly be a conflict of jurisdiction in the NCTD insofar as working of Electricity Act DER Act are concerned.	Reasoning
As a result, and going by the dicta laid down by the Constitution Bench, we set aside the decision of the Delhi High Court on this aspect and hold that it was within the jurisdiction of GNCTD to issue notification No. F.11(58/2010/Power/1856) dated June 12, 2015.	Reasoning
We may make it clear that we have not touched upon the merits of the said notification as that is not the issue before us.	Reasoning
Issue No.5	None
Whether the Revenue Department of the GNCTD had the power to revise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899?	Reasoning
The GNCTD had issued the notification dated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and Delhi Stamp (Prevention of UnderValuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007.	None

Inspector General (Registration) Validity of this notification was challenged on two counts, namely As the notification is issued in the name of LG, prior concurrence of LG was a prerequisite for issuance of such a notification.	None
Subject matter of the notification i.e. fixation of circle rates would fall under Entry 18 of List II over which the Parliament has the exclusive power inasmuch as it stands specifically excluded from the purview of GNCTD.	None
Argument of the appellant GNCTD is that fixation of circle rate is not relatable to Entry 18 of List II i.e. land.	None
It is the submission that stamp duty is imposed on an instrument with regard to the title of the land and not the land itself.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, a stamp duty would be levied on an instrument and would affect the document evidencing the said transfer of the agricultural land, but not on the land itself.	Arguments of Petitioner
The occasion for levy of stamp duty is the execution of the document conveyance, as distinguished from the immovable property which is the underlying subject matter of the transaction dealt with in the document conveyance.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, the order of 4 th August, 2015 traceable to Entry 63 of List II, rather than Entry 18 of List II.	Arguments of Petitioner
Entry 63 of List II reads as under Rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other than those specified in the provisions of List I with regard to rates of stamp duty.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant has submitted that the phrase other than those specified in the provisions of List I in Entry 63 List II is of no assistance to the Union of India.	Arguments of Petitioner
An analysis of Entry 63 of List II and Entry 91 of List I (which is the concerned provision of List I) shows that a distinction can be observed between the powers of the central and state legislatures to impose levy stamp duty.	Arguments of Petitioner
Entry 91 of List I reads as under Rates of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipts.	None
The Union is empowered to levy stamp duty ONLY on the specific types of instruments specified under Entry 91 of List I. But the State has been given the power to impose stamp duty on every other type of document instrument not mentioned under Entry 91 of List I. 152)	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also argued that it is general practice all over the country for State Governments to set the circle rates for conveyance of immovable properties within the State.	Arguments of Petitioner
Examples of the same are Karnataka Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instrument Rules, 1977 Tamil Nadu Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 1968 Andhra Pradesh Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 1975 West Bengal Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 2001 Bihar Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 1995 Haryana Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 1978 Madhya Pradesh Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 1975 Chhattisgarh Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 2001 Kerala Stamp Prevention of Undervaluation of Instruments Rules, 1968 Maharashtra Stamp Determination of true market value of property Rules, 1995.	Arguments of Petitioner
153)	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also pointed out that it was the Indian Stamp (Delhi Amendment) Act, 2001 which was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi on 28th March, 2001 and received Presidential assent on 18 th July, 2001 and the Indian Stamp (Delhi Amendment) Act, 2007 which was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Delhi on 18th September, 2007 and received the Presidential assent on 5th November, 2007 which in fact first dealt with the stamp duty payable on conveyance deeds in Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Given that neither of these Acts have been challenged and in fact the Union has given its assent to these Acts, it is submitted that there can be no question of the Union now questioning the power of the GNCTD to collect such stamp duty and fix circle rates in respect of such collections.	Arguments of Petitioner
154)	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant also stated that Section 27(3) of the Indian Stamp Act, as amended in Delhi, that too with the express consent of the Union President gives power to the Delhi Government to notify minimum rates for land for the purpose of calculation of stamp duty i.e. circle rate.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 27(3) as amended for Delhi, reads as under Facts affecting duty to be set forth in instrument (3) In the case of instruments relating to land, chargeable with valorem duty, the Government may notify minimum rates for valuation of land.	None
Emphasis Supplied It is submitted that Government under Section 27(3) must be read to mean Government of NCT of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
In reply, the respondents submit that Section 27(3) of the Indian Stamp Act is concerned with notifying minimum rates for valuation of land and it has nothing to do with rates of stamp duty.	Arguments of Respondent
As per the respondents, power to notify minimum rates for valuation of land (circle rates) is relatable to Entry 18 of List II which falls within the exclusive domain of the Union.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also argued that as per the law laid down in State of Gujarat Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
v. Akhil Gujarat	Arguments of Respondent
Pravasi V.S.	Arguments of Respondent
Mahamandal Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
(2004) 5 SCC 155 , entry in the Seventh Schedule is to be given its widest possisble interpretation.	Arguments of Respondent
According to respondents, Entry 63 of List II only deals with rates of stamp duty and, therefore, would not apply to minimum rates for valuation of land which is relatable to Entry 18 of List II.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also argued that by virtue of the Presidential Orders dated July 22, 1961 and September 07, 1966 under Article 239, the power of the Union under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 for NCT Delhi had been delegated on the LG.	Arguments of Respondent
All the previous notifications for notifying the circle rates in Delhi (July 18, 2007, March 14, 2008, November 15, 2011 etc.) had been issued by the LG in exercise of his delegated power under Article 239.	Arguments of Respondent
From the respective submissions, it becomes apparent that the entire controversy centers around the question as to whether the impugned notification is relatable to Entry 18 of List II i.e. land or the subject matter falls within the scope of Entry 63 of List II.	None
Entry 18 of List II reads as under Land, that is to say, rights in or over land, land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant, and the collection of rents transfer and alienation of agricultural land land improvement and agriculture loans colonization.	None
We may also note the language of Entry 63 List II Rates of stamp duty in respect of documents other than those specified in the provisions of List I with regard to rates of stamp duty.	None
Insofar as Entry 91 of List I is concerned, subject matter thereof is within the exclusive domain of the Centre Parliament.	None
It deals with rates of stamp duty in respect of wills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipts.	Reasoning
It follows that insofar as instruments mentioned in Entry 91 of List I are concerned, rates of stamp duty of such documents are within the exclusive domain of the Union.	Reasoning
In respect of other instruments, it is the State which has the necessary jurisdiction to fix the rates of stamp duty.	Reasoning
It would be pertinent to note that the High Court in the impugned judgment has arrived at a conclusion that notification dated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) is traceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II.	Reasoning
We are in agreement with this conclusion.	Reasoning
Said notification is issued under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act and Delhi Stamp (Prevention of UnderValuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007.	Reasoning
Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stamp duty.	Reasoning
Therefore, they do not pertain to land namely rights in or over land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agricultural land etc.	Reasoning
Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in reality a duty on transfer of property.	Reasoning
In that sense, as rightly held by the High Court, the occasion for levy of stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguished from the transaction which is embodied in the document.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even after accepting the aforesaid plea of the GNCTD, the High Court has set aside the said notification on the ground that this decision of the Council of Ministers was without seeking views concurrence of the LG.	None
As per the High Court, such an order could not be issued unless the decision of the Council of Ministers is communicated to the LG.	Reasoning
From the judgment of the Constitution Bench, it is clear that the Council of Ministers have a right to take such a decision.	None
Discussion to this extent of the High Court is expressed in Paras 107, 108, 116 and 117 of its judgment may not be entirely correct.	None
These paras read as under In the light of the abovenoticed provisions, we have no manner of doubt to conclude that every decision taken by the Council of Ministers shall be communicated to the Lt. Governor for his views.	None
The orders in terms of the decision of the Council of Ministers can be issued only where no reference to the Central Government is required as provided in Chapter V of the Transaction of Business Rules.	None
Making a reference by the Lt. Governor to the Central Government as provided under Chapter V of the Transaction of Business Rules is possible only when the decision is communicated to the Lt. Governor.	None
Therefore, there is no substance in the contention that an order can be passed pursuant to the decision of the Council of Ministers without communicating such decision to the Lt.Governor for his views concurrence with respect to any of the matters enumerated in ListII or ListIII except the three reserved matters in Entries 1, 2 and 18 of ListII.	None
The emphasis sought to be laid by the learned Senior Counsels who appeared for GNCTD on Rule 23 of the Transaction of Business Rules to substantiate the contention that those proposals which are mentioned in Rule 23 alone are required to be submitted to Lt. Governor is misplaced.	None
The word essentially employed in Rule 23 makes clear the legislative intent that the proposals specified (i) to (viii) therein are not exhaustive.	None
Any interpretation contra would render the Transaction of Business Rules ultra vires Clause (4) of Article 239AA of the Constitution.	None
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
xx	Arguments of Petitioner
For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the considered view that it is mandatory under the Constitutional scheme to communicate the decision of the Council of Ministers to the Lt. Governor even in relation to the matters in respect of which power to make laws has been conferred on the Legislative Assembly of NCTD and an order thereon can be issued only where the Lt. Governor does not take a different view.	None
Hence, the contention on behalf of the Government of NCT of Delhi that the Lt. Governor is bound to act only on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers is untenable and cannot be accepted.	None
The Constitution Bench judgment of this Court clarifies that in all those matters which do not fall within the discretionary jurisdiction of the LG, the LG is bound to act on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.	None
Further, majority opinion also holds that executive power of the GNCTD extends to all the subject matters contained in List II (except Entry 1, 2 and 18) as well as List III (wherein it has concurrent jurisdiction along with the Central Government).	None
That is the interpretation accorded to clause (4) of Article 239AA.	None
At the same time, this clause contains a proviso as well which reads as under Provided that in the case of difference of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers on any matter, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for decision given thereon by the President and pending such decision it shall be competent for the Lieutenant Governor in any case where the matter, in his opinion, is so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, to take such action or to give such direction in the matter as he deems necessary.	None
Interpreting this proviso, it is held as under Now, it is essential to analyse clause (4) of Article 239AA, the most important provision for determination of the controversy at hand.	None
Clause (4) stipulates a Westminster style Cabinet system of Government for NCT of Delhi where there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head to aid and advise the Lieutenant Governor in the exercise of his functions in relation to matters with respect to which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has power to enact laws except in matters in respect of which the Lieutenant Governor is required to act in his discretion.	None
The proviso to clause (4) of Article 239AA stipulates that in case of a difference of opinion on any matter between the Lieutenant Governor and his Ministers, the Lieutenant Governor shall refer it to the President for a binding decision.	Reasoning
Further, pending such decision by the President, in any case where the matter, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor, is so urgent that it is necessary for him to take immediate action, the proviso makes him competent to take such action and issue such directions as he deems necessary.	None
A conjoint reading of Article 239AA(3)(a) and Article 239AA(4) reveals that the executive power of the Government of NCT of Delhi is coextensive with the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly which is envisaged in Article 239AA(3) and which extends over all but three subjects in the State List and all subjects in the Concurrent List and, thus, Article 239AA(4) confers executive power on the Council of Ministers over all those subjects for which the Delhi Legislative Assembly has legislative power.	None
Article 239AA(3)(a) reserves Parliaments legislative power on all matters in the State List and Concurrent List, but clause (4) nowhere reserves the executive powers of the Union with respect to such matters.	None
On the contrary, clause (4) explicitly grants to the Government of Delhi executive powers in relation to matters for which the Legislative Assembly has power to legislate.	None
The legislative power is conferred upon the Assembly to enact whereas the policy of the legislation has to be given effect to by the executive for which the Government of Delhi has to have coextensive executive powers.	None
Such a view is in consonance with the observation in Ram Jawaya Kapur Ram Jawaya Kapur v. State of Punjab, AIR 1955 SC 549 which has been discussed elaborately in the earlier part of the judgment.	None

From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the words any matter occurring in the proviso to Article 239AA(4) do not necessarily need to be construed to mean every matter.	None
As highlighted in the authorities referred to hereinabove, the word any occurring in a statute or constitutional provision is not to be mechanically read to mean every and the context in which the word has been used must be given due weightage so as to deduce the real intention and purpose in which the word has been used.	None
It has to be clearly understood that though any may not mean every, yet how it should be understood is extremely significant.	None
Let us elaborate.	None
The power given to the Lieutenant Governor under the proviso to Article 239AA(4) contains the rule of exception and should not be treated as a general norm.	None
The Lieutenant Governor is to act with constitutional objectivity keeping in view the high degree of constitutional trust reposed in him while exercising the special power ordained upon him unlike the Governor and the President who are bound by the aid and advice of their Ministers.	None
The Lieutenant Governor need not, in a mechanical manner, refer every decision of his Ministers to the President.	None
He has to be guided by the concept of constitutional morality.	None
There have to be some valid grounds for the Lieutenant Governor to refer the decision of the Council of Ministers to the President in order to protect the interest of NCT of Delhi and the principle of constitutionalism.	None
As per the 1991 Act and the Rules of Business, he has to be apprised of every decision taken by the Council of Ministers.	None
He cannot change the decision.	None
That apart, there is no provision for concurrence.	None
He has the authority to differ.	None
But it cannot be difference for the sake of difference.	None
It cannot be mechanical or in a routine matter.	None
The power has been conferred to guide, discuss and see that the administration runs for the welfare of the people and also NCT of Delhi that has been given a special status.	None
Therefore, the word any has to be understood treating as a guidance meant for the constitutional authority.	None
He must bear in mind the constitutional objectivity, the needed advice and the realities.	None
The proviso to Article 239AA(4), we say without any fear of contradiction, cannot be interpreted in a strict sense of the mere words employed treating them as only letters without paying heed to the thought and the spirit which they intend to convey.	None
They are not to be treated as bones and flesh without nerves and neurons that make the nerves functional.	None
We feel, it is necessary in the context to read the words of the provision in the spirit of citizenry participation in the governance of a democratic polity that is republican in character.	None
We may hasten to add that when we say so, it should not be construed that there is allowance of enormous entry of judicial creativity, for the construction one intends to place has its plinth and platform on the Preamble and precedents pertaining to constitutional interpretation and purposive interpretation keeping in view the conception of sense and spirit of the Constitution.	None
It is, in a way, exposition of judicial sensibility to the functionalism of the Constitution.	None
And we call it constitutional pragmatism.	None
The authorities in power should constantly remind themselves that they are constitutional functionaries and they have the responsibility to ensure that the fundamental purpose of administration is the welfare of the people in an ethical manner.	None
There is requirement of discussion and deliberation.	None
The fine nuances are to be dwelled upon with mutual respect.	None
Neither of the authorities should feel that they have been lionised.	None
They should feel that they are serving the constitutional norms, values and concepts.	None
Interpretation cannot ignore the conscience of the Constitution.	None
That apart, when we take a broader view, we are also alive to the consequence of such an interpretation.	None
If the expressions in case of difference and on any matter are construed to mean that the Lieutenant Governor can differ on any proposal, the expectation of the people which has its legitimacy in a democratic setup, although different from States as understood under the Constitution, will lose its purpose in simple semantics.	None
The essence and purpose should not be lost in grammar like the philosophy of geometry cannot be allowed to lose its universal metaphysics in the methods of drawing.	None
And that is why, we deliberated upon many a concept.	None
Thus, the Administrator, as per the Rules of Business, has to be apprised of each decision taken by a Minister or Council of Ministers, but that does not mean that the Lieutenant Governor should raise an issue in every matter.	None
The difference of opinion must meet the standards of constitutional trust and morality, the principle of collaborative federalism and constitutional balance, the concept of constitutional governance and objectivity and the nurtured and cultivated idea of respect for a representative Government.	None
The difference of opinion should never be based on the perception of right to differ and similarly the term on any matter should not be put on such a platform as to conceive that as one can differ, it should be a norm on each occasion.	None
The difference must meet the concept of constitutional trust reposed in the authority and there has to be objective assessment of the decision that is sent for communication and further the rationale of difference of opinion should be demonstrable and it should contain sound reason.	None
There should not be exposition of the phenomenon of an obstructionist but reflection of the philosophy of affirmative constructionism and a visionary.	None
The constitutional amendment does not perceive a situation of constant friction and difference which gradually builds a structure of conflict.	None
At the same time, the Council of Ministers being headed by the Chief Minister should be guided by values and prudence accepting the constitutional position that NCT of Delhi is not a State.	None
In a concurring opinion on this aspect, Chandrachud, J. has also given lucid commentary.	None
It becomes clear from the above that even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision, the LG is also empowered to form its opinion on any matter which may be different from the decision taken by his Ministers.	Reasoning
Any matter does not mean each and every matter or every trifling matter but only those rare and exceptional matters where the difference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territory that it deserved to be escalated to the President.	Reasoning
Therefore, the LG is not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council of Minister.	Reasoning
Difference should be on cogent and strong reasons.	Reasoning
However, this limitation pertains to LGs exercise of power.	Reasoning
At the same time, the proviso recognises that there may be contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ.	Reasoning
In such circumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the President for decision and act according to the decision given thereon by the President.	Reasoning
It means that final say, in case of different between LG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President.	Reasoning
Such a scheme of things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers is supposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to form his view thereupon.	Reasoning
The decision cannot be implemented without referring the same to the LG in the first instance.	Reasoning
More pertinently, the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT.	Reasoning
Therefore, we agree with the conclusion of the High Court that views of LG should have been taken before issuing circular dated August 4, 2015.	Reasoning
However, we would like to add that normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honour the wisdom of the council of ministers.	None
He is also expected to clear the files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly.	Reasoning
Hes under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subject matter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situation so demands.	Reasoning
That in fact is the facet of good governance.	Reasoning
Likewise , the executive is also expected to give due deference to the unique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutional scheme.	Reasoning
By and large, it demands a mutual respect between the two organs.	Reasoning
Both should realise that they are here to serve the people of NCTD.	Reasoning
Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for the effective working of the system.	Reasoning
Issue No.6	None
Whether it is the Lieutenant Governor or the GNCTD which has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor under Section 24 of the Cr.PC.?	Reasoning
Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as per the provisions of Section 24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the following effect Public Prosecutors.	Reasoning
The Central Government or the State Government may appoint, for the purposes of any case or class of cases, a person who has been in practice as an advocate for not less than ten years as a Special Public Prosecutor.	None
As is clear from the above, power to appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon the Central Government and the State Government.	Reasoning
The question, therefore, arises is as to whether the expression State Government would include GNCTD.	None
As per the appellant, once the Government of NCT of Delhi is found to be the State Government under the Cr.P.C., necessarily the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor will also lie with the Government of NCT of Delhi.	None
If the contention of the Union of India is to be accepted then under the Cr.P.C. both the Central Government and State Government will be the Central Government alone, which will be a completely absurd legal position, particularly in light of the fact that subsequent to the 69 th Amendment, various powers of the State Government under the Cr.P.C., including appointment of public prosecutors, have been exercised by the elected government of NCT of Delhi.	None
Referring to the impugned judgment, on this issue, it is pointed out that the High Court has held that the definition of Section 3(60) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 will apply to interpret the term State Government and it would thus be the Central Government, which would be the State Government.

It is argued that this approach is wrong as the issue of appointment of public prosecutor relates to Criminal Procedure, i.e. Entry 2 of List II over which the Delhi Assembly and Executive exercise power, the Lt. Governor must act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the NCT of Delhi.	None
It is contended that this convoluted method of reasoning was not necessary and the entire issue could be resolved if the Government of NCT of Delhi was held to be a State Government of NCT of Delhi by application of definition of State in Section 3(58) of General Clauses Act, 1897 to interpret State Government in the Cr.P.C., instead of definition of Section 3(60) of the GC Act which is obviously repugnant to the subject and context of Cr.P.C.	None
We may mention at this stage that writ petition was filed in the High Court by the GNCTD challenging the order of the Special Judge dated September 7, 2015 and order of LG dated September 4, 2015 appointing Shri S.K. Gupta, Advocate as Special Public Prosecutor to conduct the prosecution in FIR No. 21 of 2012 dated December 17, 2012.	Reasoning
The GNCTD had appointed another lawyer as Special Public Prosecutor.	Reasoning
The High Court has held that under Section 24(8) of Cr.P.C., State Government is empowered to appoint Special Public Prosecutor.	Reasoning
However, as NCTD is a Union Territory, by virtue of Section 3(60) of the GC Act, it is the Central Government which should be the State Government.	Reasoning
Further, since by notification dated March 20, 1974, administrator is empowered to exercise powers and the expression State Government would mean the LG.	Reasoning
At the same time, the High Court has also observed that power to appoint Public Prosecutor is relatable to Entries 1 and 2 of List III in respect of which GNCTD has legislative competence.	Reasoning
Therefore, the LG must appoint Special Public Prosecutor on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.	Reasoning
As is clear from the arguments of GNCTD noted above, it is aggrieved by that part of the impugned order of the High Court whereby State Government in respect of NCTD is held to be the Central Government by virtue of Section 3(60) of the GC Act.	Reasoning
On the other hand, the Union Government is aggrieved by that portion of the order of the High Court where it is held that LG must appoint Special Public Prosecutor on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.	Reasoning
Arguments on behalf of the Union of India is that by virtue of Notification dated March 20, 1974, President under Article 239 had empowered the Administrator to exercise all the powers conferred upon State Government by the Cr.P.C. except that conferred by Section 8 and 477.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, the power under Section 24 to appoint Prosecutor or Special Public Prosecutor vests with the LG and not the Government of NCT.	Arguments of Respondent
So far as Entries 1 and 2, List III are concerned, it is argued that undoubtedly Legislative Assembly of NCT has legislative competence qua said entries	Arguments of Respondent
but it is subservient to the legislative power of the Union.	Arguments of Respondent
It is contended that legislative competence of NCT Delhi cannot derogate from or be repugnant to law of Parliament.	Arguments of Respondent
And once Cr.P.C., 1973 has been made by the Parliament dealing exhaustively and comprehensively with criminal procedure the executive power of GNCTD as well as the legislative power would stand eroded and become subservient to the central executive.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, GNCTD can exercise executive power only upon an express conferment of power by Cr.P.C.	Arguments of Respondent
There is no such conferment.	Arguments of Respondent
It is the Central Government alone which would have independent power to appoint Special Public Prosecutor.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also argued that assuming without admitting that under Section 24 both Central Government are empowered to appoint Public Prosecutor Special Public Prosecutor under Section 24(1) and 24(8), the Central Government cannot be prevented or restrained from making appointment, and wherever the Central Government has already made an appointment of a Public Prosecutor with respect to a case or a class of clases, the UT Government would not be competent to make a parallel appointment.	Arguments of Respondent
We find that in answering this question, the High Court has entered into the following discussion As could be seen, Section 24(8) of Cr.	None
P.C. empowers the State Government for appointing a Special Public Prosecutor for the purposes of any case or class of cases.	None
Admittedly, NCT of Delhi is a Union Territory and not a State.	Arguments of Respondent
As per Sections 3(8), 3(58) and 3(60) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the expression State Government for the purpose of a Union Territory means the President and includes the Administrator in terms of Article 239 of the Constitution read with the Notification dated 20.03.1974 See Para 167 (supra) under which the Administrators of all the Union Territories were empowered to exercise the powers of the State Government under Cr.P.C.	None
So far as NCT of Delhi is concerned, the State Government thus means the Lt. Governor for the purpose of Section 24(8) of Cr.P.C.	None
However, the power to appoint a Public Prosecutor is relatable to Entries 1 and 2 of List III in respect of which the Government of NCT of Delhi has legislative competence under Article 239AA of the Constitution.	None
As a corollary, the exercise of the functions relating to the said subject by the Lt. Governor under Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution shall be on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the head.	None
Hence, we are unable to accept the contention of the Union of India that the Council of Ministers have no role to play in exercise of the powers under Section 24(8) of Cr.P.C.	None
In our considered opinion, the Lt. Governor under Section 24(8) of Cr.P.C. does not act eonominee but exercises the executive functions of the State.	None
Hence, the said power has to be exercised on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers in terms of Clause (4) of Article 239AA of the Constitution.	None
For the above reasons, we are of the view that it is not open to the Lt. Governor to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor on his own without seeking aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	None
In the circumstances, the impugned order dated 07.09.2015 passed by the Special Judge07 in FIR No.21/2012 is hereby set aside and there shall be a direction to the Special Judge to pass an appropriate order afresh in accordance with law.	None
In the earlier part of the discussion, it has held As per Sections 3(8), 3(58) and 3(60) of the GC Act, the expression State Government for the purposes of a Union Territory means the President and includes the Administrator in terms of Article 239A of the Constitution.	None
Insofar as NCT of Delhi is concerned, the State Government, thus, means the Lieutenant Governor for the purposes of Section 24(8) of Cr.P.C.	None
Though, we have accepted the interpretation, as given by the High Court in respect of the provisions of the GC Act mentioned above while discussing the expression State Government in the context of COI Act, this position is clarified while dealing with the same expression occuring in Section 2(5) of the Electricity Act, 2003.	Reasoning
We have made it clear that it would depend upon language used in defining State Government in a particular enactment.	Reasoning
We have also pointed out the difference in the definitions of Appropriate Government, under the COI Act and Electricity Act.	Reasoning
This becomes important in the light of decision contained in the Constitution Bench judgment which clearly holds that under various circumstances, the expression State Government would be relatable to GNCTD, notwithstanding the fact that it continues to be the Union Territory.	Reasoning
The Constitution Bench judgment has also not accepted the opinion of the High Court insofar as it treats State Government as the Lieutenant Governor.	Reasoning
In any case, it may not be necessary to dwell much upon this aspect.	Reasoning
The High Court has also categorically held that the power to appoint a Public Prosecutor is relatable to Entries 1 and 2 of List III.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the High Court has rightly held that in respect of these entries, the Government of NCT of Delhi has legislative competence under Article 239AA of the Constitution and that the LG under Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution shall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	Reasoning
This conclusion of the High Court is in tune with the judgment of the Constitution Bench.	None
We, therefore, hold that Lieutenant Governor, while appointing the Special Public Prosecutor, is to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.	Decision
This issue is answered accordingly.	None
All the appeals stand disposed of by answering the issues in the manner aforesaid.	Decision
Contempt Petition also stands disposed of.	None
ASHOK BHUSHAN, J. I have gone through the erudite and elaborate judgment of my esteemed brother, Justice A.K. Sikri.	None
Justice A.K. Sikri, in his opinion has noted the details of facts giving rise to these appeals, order passed in these appeals referring it to the Constitution Bench and the judgment of Constitution Bench delivered on 04.07.2018.	Issue
My Brother has noted the elaborate submissions made before us, after the Constitution Bench has answered the reference and sent back the matter to the regular Bench for deciding these appeals.	Issue
The submissions made before us by learned counsel for the parties having been elaborately noted in the opinion of my esteemed Brother, I feel no necessity of burdening this judgment by reproducing the submissions again.	Issue
Justice Sikri has framed six issues in paragraph Nos. 63 to 68 for consideration in these appeals, which are as follows The first issue is whether the exclusion of Services relatable to Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule from the legislative and executive domain of the NCT of Delhi, vide notification of the Government of India dated May 21, 2015, is unconstitutional and illegal?	Issue
The second issue is whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the AntiCorruption Branch (ACB) of the NCT of Delhi to investigate offences committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1987 by the officials of Central Government and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of GNCTD alone is legal?	Issue
(These two issues arise in Civil Appeal No. 2357 of 2017).	Issue
The third issue is raised in Civil Appeal Nos. 2358, 2359 and 2360 of 2017.	Issue
In all these three appeals, the common issue is whether the GNCTD is an Appropriate Government under the Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952?	Issue
The fourth issue, which is raised in Civil Appeal No. 2363 of 2017, is Whether under Section 108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and under Section 12 of the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000, the power to issue directions with the State Commission is with the Government of NCT of Delhi?	Issue
Similar issue is the subject matter of Civil Appeal No. 2361 of 2017, viz.	Issue
whether the orders of the GNCTD nominating Directors to Distribution Companies in Delhi under the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 read with Delhi Electricity Reforms (Transfer Scheme) Rules, 2001, without obtaining the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor are valid?	Issue
The fifth issue is common to Civil Appeal No. 2362 of 2017 filed by the GNCTD and Civil Appeal No. 2364 of 2017 filed by Union of India, wherein the issue is whether the Revenue Department of the GNCTD has the power to revise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899?	Issue
The sixth issue, which is the subject matter of Criminal Appeal No. 277 of 2018, pertains to the appointment of Special Public Prosecutors, viz., whether it is the Lieutenant Governor or the GNCTD which has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor under Section 24 of the Cr.P.C.?	Issue
I am in full agreement with the conclusions arrived at by my esteemed Brother on Issue Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.	None
I do not intend to add anything on the above issues.	None
On Issue No.1, I do not entirely agree with the opinion of my esteemed brother, however, I am in agreement with his opinion that Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is not available to the Delhi Legislative Assembly.	None
I proceed to consider the Issue No.1.	None
As noted above with regard to decisions on all other issues as given in the opinion of my esteemed brother I entirely agree.	None
It is C.A.No.2357 of 2017(Govt. of NCT of Delhi vs. Union of India) filed against the judgment of the Delhi High Court dated 04.08.2016 in Writ Petition (C)No.5888 of 2015 in which the above issue has arisen.	None
The Writ Petition (C)No.5888 of 2015 (Govt. of NCT of Delhi vs. Union of India) was filed challenging the notifications dated 21.05.2015 and 23.07.2014 issued by the Govt.	None
of India, Ministry of Home Affairs empowering the Lt. Governor to exercise the powers in respect of matters connected with Services.	None
The notification dated 21.05.2015 which was challenged in Writ Petition (C)No.5888 of 2015 was to the following effect MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS NOTIFICATION New Delhi, the 21st May, 2015 O. 1368(E).Whereas article 239 of the Constitution provides that every Union Territory shall be administered by the President acting, to such extent as he thinks fit, through an administrator to be appointed by him with such designation as he may specify And whereas article 239AA inserted by the Constitution (Sixtyninth Amendment) Act, 1991 provides that the Union Territory of Delhi shall be called the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the administrator thereof appointed under article 239 shall be designated as the Lieutenant Governor And whereas subclause (a) of clause (3) of article 239AA states that the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws for the whole or any part of the National Capital Territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories except matters with respect to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List and Entries 64, 65 and 66 of that List in so far as they relate to the said Entries 1, 2 and 18 and whereas Entry 1 relates to Public Order, Entry 2 relates to Police and Entry 18 relates to Land.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas subclause (a) of clause (3) of article 239AA also qualifies the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under this provision, a reference may be made to Entry 41 of the State List which deals with the State Public Services, State Public Service Commission which do not exist in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the Union Territories Cadre consisting of Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service personnel is common to Union Territories of Delhi, Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Puducherry and States of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa and Mizoram which is administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs and similarly DANICS and DANIPS are common services catering to the requirement of the Union Territories of Daman Diu, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep including the National Capital Territory of Delhi which is also administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Home Affairs.	Arguments of Petitioner
As such, it is clear that the National Capital Territory of Delhi does not have its own State Public Services.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, Services will fall within this category.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas it is well established that where there is no legislative power, there is no executive power since executive power is coextensive with legislative power.	Arguments of Petitioner
And whereas matters relating to Entries 1, 2 18 of the State List being Public Order, Police and Land respectively and Entries 64, 65 66 of that list in so far as they relate to Entries 1, 2 18 as also Services fall outside the purview of Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and consequently the Government of NCT of Delhi will have no executive power in relation to the above and further that power in relation to the aforesaid subjects vests exclusively in the President or his delegate i.e. the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Now, therefore, in accordance with the provisions contained in article 239 and subclause (a) of clause (3) of 239AA, the President hereby directs that  subject to his control and further orders, the Lieutenant Governor of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, shall in respect of matters connected with Public Order, Police, Land and Services as stated hereinabove, exercise the powers and discharge the functions of the Central Government, to the extent delegated to him from time to time by the President.

The submissions made before us have been elaborately noticed by Justice A.K. Sikri which need no repetition in this order.	None
The Constitution Bench having answered the reference vide its judgment dated 04.07.2018, we are required to decide these appeals as per the opinion of the Constitution Bench.	Issue
Article 145 clause (3) of the Constitution of India provides as follows Article 145(3)	None
The minimum number of Judges who are to sit for the purpose of deciding any case involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution or for the purpose of hearing any reference under Article 143 shall be five Provided that, where the Court hearing an appeal under any of the provisions of this chapter other than Article 132 consists of less than five Judges and in the course of the hearing of the appeal the Court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the appeal, such Court shall refer the question for opinion to a Court constituted as required by this clause for the purpose of deciding any case involving such a question and shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion.	Arguments of Petitioner
The expression shall on receipt of the opinion dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion occurring in proviso to Article 145 clause (3) obliges this Bench to dispose of the appeal in conformity with such opinion.	None
We, thus, need to find as to what is the opinion of the Constitution Bench in accordance with which the appeal is to be disposed of.	None
On first question as noted above, what is opinion of the Constitution Bench has to be ascertained to apply the same in deciding the appeal.	None
Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel and Shri Maninder Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General(as he then was) submitted that the majority judgment of the Constitution Bench authored by Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) has neither considered the submission that Entry 41 of List II of the VIIth Schedule of the Constitution is not available to Legislative Assembly of Delhi nor answered the said question.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that although before the Constitution Bench it was emphatically submitted that as per Article 239AA subclause (3)(a) the Legislative Assembly shall have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories .	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted before us that emphasis before the Constitution Bench was that all matters enumerated in State List and Concurrent List shall not be ipso facto available to Legislative Assembly of Delhi and Legislative power is given only of those matters which matters are applicable to Union Territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that the Constitution Bench has specifically noted the above argument but has neither considered nor decided the issue, hence, the issue has to be considered and decided by this Bench.	None
Entry 41 of List II which is the subject matter of consideration is as follows State public services State Public Service Commission.	None
We may first notice that the Constitution Bench speaking through Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) as well as two other opinions have noted that the controversy in individual appeals need not to be dwelled upon by the Constitution Bench as the Constitution Bench is to answer only the constitutional issues.	None
In the opinion of Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) following was stated in paragraph 13 Having prefaced thus, we shall now proceed to state the controversy in brief since in this batch of appeals which has been referred to the Constitution Bench, we are required to advert to the issue that essentially pertains to the powers conferred on the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the executive power exercised by the elected Government of NCT of Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
The facts involved and the controversy raised in each individual appeal need not be dwelled upon, for we only intend to answer the constitutional issue.	None
In paragraph 486 of the judgment (in my opinion) following was stated These appeals, thus, have been placed before this Constitution Bench.	None
At the outset, it was agreed between the learned counsel for the parties that this Constitution Bench may only answer the constitutional questions and the individual appeals thereafter will be decided by appropriate regular Benches.	Arguments of Respondent
The submissions which are being pressed before us by Shri Rakesh Dwivedi as well as Shri Maninder Singh were also pressed before the Constitution Bench, the specific submission was that the power of Legislative Assembly of Delhi on subject matter provided in List II and III of Seventh Schedule is limited by very same Article when it implies in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories .	Arguments of Respondent
It is useful to notice that in paragraph 39 of the judgment of Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) following has been noticed The respondents also contend that although Article 239AA confers on the Legislative Assembly of Delhi the power to legislate with respect to subjectmatters provided in List II and List III of the Seventh Schedule, yet the said power is limited by the very same Article when it employs the phrase insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories and also by specifically excluding from the legislative power of the Assembly certain entries as delineated in Article 239AA(3)(a).	Arguments of Petitioner
This restriction, as per the respondents, limits the power of the Legislative Assembly to legislate and this restriction has to be understood in the context of conferment of special status.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Constitution Bench speaking through Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) has in its judgment clearly accepted the position that NCT of Delhi is not a State and it remains a Union Territory.	None
In this reference, in paragraph Nos. 196 and 201 of the judgment following has been laid down Thus, NDMC makes it clear as crystal that all Union Territories under our constitutional scheme are not on the same pedestal and as far as NCT of Delhi is concerned, it is not a State within the meaning of Article 246 or Part VI of the Constitution.	Arguments of Respondent
Though NCT of Delhi partakes a unique position after the Sixtyninth Amendment, yet in sum and substance, it remains a Union Territory which is governed by Article 246(4) of the Constitution and to which Parliament, in the exercise of its constituent power, has given the appellation of the National Capital Territory of Delhi.	Arguments of Respondent
In the light of the aforesaid analysis and the ruling of the nineJudge Bench in NDMC, it is clear as noonday that by no stretch of imagination, NCT of Delhi can be accorded the status of a State under our present constitutional scheme and the status of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is not that of a Governor of a State, rather he remains an Administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of Lieutenant Governor.	Arguments of Respondent
Discussion being confined only to Legislative power conferred on the Delhi Legislative Assembly it is useful to notice the opinion expressed by the Constitution Bench in the above regard.	None
In paragraph Nos. 217 and 219 following has been laid down Subclause (a) of clause (3) of Article 239AA establishes the power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly to enact laws for NCT of Delhi with respect to matters enumerated in the State List and or Concurrent List except insofar as matters with respect to and which relate to Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, it is evident from clause (3) of Article 239AA that Parliament has the power to make laws for NCT of Delhi on any of the matters enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent List and at the same time, the Legislative Assembly of Delhi also has the legislative power with respect to matters enumerated in the State List and the Concurrent List except matters with respect to entries which have been explicitly excluded from Article 239AA(3)(a).	Arguments of Petitioner
In the above paragraphs Constitution Bench held that the power of the Legislative Assembly to make laws of NCT of Delhi is with respect to matters enumerated in State List and the Concurrent List except in so far as matters with respect to and which relate to entries 1,2 and 18 of the State List.	Arguments of Petitioner
What is noticed in paragraph No. 217 is what is stated in general terms in Article 239AA(3)(a) of the Constitution.	Issue
The Constitution Bench has not bestowed its consideration on the purpose and intent of expression with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territory of Delhi .	Issue
The reason is not far to seek.	Issue
Individual issues which had arisen in different appeals were not touched by the Constitution Bench leaving it open to be decided by the regular Bench after constitutional questions are answered.	Issue
Whether the services are within legislative competence of Delhi Legislative Assembly is one of the issues which has directly arisen in C.A.No.2357 of 2017.	Issue
Thus, there is no opinion of Constitution Bench as to whether Entry 41 of List II is available to Legislative Assembly of Delhi or not except a general statement that Legislative Assembly of Delhi shall have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I and List II except Entries 1, 2 and 18 of State List.	Issue
We may also notice the conclusion recorded by the Constitution Bench speaking through Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) in paragraph No.284.	None
The conclusion in paragraph No.284.13 is as follows 284.13.	None
With the insertion of Article 239AA by virtue of the Sixtyninth Amendment, Parliament envisaged a representative form of Government for NCT of Delhi.	None
The said provision intends to provide for the Capital a directly elected Legislative Assembly which shall have legislative powers over matters falling within the State List and the Concurrent List, barring those excepted, and a mandate upon the Lieutenant Governor to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except when he decides to refer the matter to the President for final decision.	None
As noticed above the Constitution Bench in paragraph No.39 extracted above has noticed the submissions of the counsel for the respondents that words insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories in Article 239AA(3)(a) restrict the Legislative power of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi to only those entries which are only applicable to Union Territories and not all.	Arguments of Petitioner
The elaborate discussion on its answer is not found in the majority opinion expressed by Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was).	None
The submission having been made before the Constitution Bench which submission was considered in other two opinions expressed by Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and myself, it is useful to notice as to what has been said in other two opinions in the Constitution Bench.	None
Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud in his opinion has dealt with the submission under the separate heading as indicated at Serial No.K(v) in the Index in the beginning of the judgment which is to the following effect K(v) Insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories In pages 736 and 737 of the judgment of Dr.Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, the said submission has been considered in paragraph Nos. 461, 462 and 463 and following has been laid down Article 239AA(3)(a) permits the Legislative Assembly of the NCT to legislate on matters in the State List, except for Entries 1, 2 and 18 (and Entries 64, 65 and 66 insofar as they relate to the earlier entries) and on the Concurrent List, insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories .	Arguments of Petitioner
In forming an understanding of these words of Article 239AA(3)(a), it has to be noticed that since the decision in Kanniyan right through to the nineJudge Bench decision in NDMC, it has been held that the expression State in Article 246 does not include a Union Territory.	None
The expression insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories cannot be construed to mean that the Legislative Assembly of NCT would have no power to legislate on any subject in the State or Concurrent Lists, merely by the use of the expression State in that particular entry.	None
This is not a correct reading of the above words of Article 239AA(3) (a).	None
As we see below, that is not how Parliament has construed them as well.	None
Section 7(5) of the GNCTD Act provides that salaries of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly may be fixed by the Legislative Assembly by law.	None
Section 19 provides that the Members of the Legislative Assembly shall receive salaries and allowances as determined by the Legislative Assembly by law.	None
Section 43(3) similarly provides that the salaries and allowances of Ministers shall be determined by the Legislative Assembly.	None
However, Section 24 provides that a Bill for the purpose has to be reserved for the consideration of the President.	None
Parliament would not have enacted the above provisions unless legislative competence resided in the States on the above subject.	None
The subjects pertaining to the salaries and allowances of Members of the Legislature of the State (including the Speaker and Deputy Speaker) and of the Ministers for the State are governed by Entry 38 and Entry 40 of the State List.	None
The GNCTD Act recognises the legislative competence of the Legislative Assembly of NCT to enact legislation on these subjects.	None
The use of the expression State in these entries does not divest the jurisdiction of the Legislative Assembly.	None
Nor are the words of Article 239AA(3)(a) exclusionary or disabling in nature.	None
The purpose of the above narration is to indicate that the expression State is by itself not conclusive of whether a particular provision of the Constitution would apply to Union Territories.	None
Similarly, it can also be stated that the definition of the expression State in Section 3(58) of the General Clauses Act (which includes a Union Territory) will not necessarily govern all references to State in the Constitution.	None
If there is something which is repugnant in the subject or context, the inclusive definition in Section 3(58) will not apply.	None
This is made clear in the precedent emanating from this Court.	None
In certain contexts, it has been held that the expression State will not include Union Territories while in other contexts the definition in Section 3(58) has been applied.	None
Hence, the expression insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories is not one of exclusion nor can it be considered to be so irrespective of subject or context.	None
Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud while considering the expression in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories as occurring in Article 239AA(3) has held that the ability of the Legislative Assembly is circumscribed by the above expression.	None
In Paragraph No. 316 of the Constitution Bench judgment, he has observed following Clause (3) of Article 239AA defines the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly for the NCT.	None
Subclause (a) empowers the Legislative Assembly for the NCT to enact law with respect to any of the matters contained in the State or Concurrent Lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.	None
The ability of the Legislative Assembly is circumscribed insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories .	None
The Legislative Assembly can hence enact legislation in regard to the entries in the State and Concurrent Lists to the extent to which they apply to a Union Territory.	None
Of equal significance is the exception which has been carved out Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List (and Entries 64, 65 and 66 insofar as they relate to Entries 1, 2 and 18) lie outside the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of NCT.	None
Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, thus, held that expression State is by itself not conclusive of whether a particular provision of the Constitution would apply to Union Territories.	None
His Lordship opined that the expression insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories is not one of exclusion nor can it be considered to be so irrespective of subject or context.	None
I had also dealt with the above submission in paragraph Nos. 500, 551 and 552 in following words It is submitted that even when Article 239AA(3)(a) stipulates that Legislative Assembly of Delhi shall have the power to legislate in respect of subjectmatters provided in List II and List III of the VIIth Schedule of the Constitution of India, it specifically restricts the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi to those subjectmatters which are applicable to Union Territories.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Constitution envisages that List II and List III of the VIIth Schedule of the Constitution of India contain certain subjectmatters which are not applicable to Union Territories.	None
The intention of the Constitutionmakers is that even when the subjectmatters contained in List II and List III of the VIIth Schedule become available to the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi, the subjectmatters in the said Lists which are not applicable to Union Territories would not become available to the Legislative Assembly of NCT of Delhi and would be beyond its legislative powers.	None
The provision is very clear which empowers the Legislative Assembly to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or in the Concurrent List except the excluded entries.	None
One of the issues is that power to make laws in State List or in Concurrent List is hedged by phrase insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories .	None
A look at the entries in List II and List III indicates that there is no mention of Union Territory.	None
A perusal of Lists II and III indicates that although in various entries there is specific mention of word State but there is no express reference of Union Territory in any of the entries.	None
For example, in List II Entries 12, 26, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43, there is specific mention of word State.	None
Similarly, in List III Entries 3, 4 and 43 there is mention of word State.	None
The above phrase insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territory is inconsequential.	None
The reasons are twofold.	None
On the commencement of the Constitution, there was no concept of Union Territories and there were only Part A, B, C and D States.	None
After Seventh Constitutional Amendment, where First Schedule as well as Article 2 of the Constitution were amended which included mention of Union Territory both in Article 1 as well as in First Schedule.	None
Thus, the above phrase was used to facilitate the automatic conferment of powers to make laws for Delhi on all matters including those relatable to the State List and Concurrent List except where an entry indicates that its applicability to the Union Territory is excluded by implication or any express constitutional provision.	None
In the above paragraphs the opinion is expressed that all matters including those relatable to the State List and Concurrent List are available to Legislative Assembly of Delhi except where an entry indicates that its applicability to the Union Territory is excluded by implication or by any express constitutional provision.	Arguments of Respondent
The conclusion is, thus, that all entries of List II and List III are available to Legislative Assembly for exercising Legislative power except when an entry is excluded by implication or by any express provision.	None
The majority opinion delivered by Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) having not dealt with the expression insofar as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories , it is, thus, clear that no opinion has been expressed in the majority opinion of the Constitution Bench, hence the said issue is required to be elaborately answered for deciding C.A.No.2357 of 2017.	None
As noted above, Article 239AA has been inserted by Constitution 69 th Amendment, 1991 with effect from 1 st February, 1992.	None
Legislative powers to Legislative Assembly for Union Territory was an accepted principle even before 69 th Constitution (Amendment) Act.	None
The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 was enacted by Parliament in reference to Article 239A brought by Constitution 14 th Amendment, 1962.	Arguments of Respondent
Article 239A provided as follows 239A. Creation of local Legislatures or Council of Ministers or both for certain Union territories.	None
Parliament may by law create for the Union territory of Pondicherry (a) a body, whether elected or partly nominated and partly elected, to function as a Legislature for the Union territory, or (b) a Council of Ministers, or both with such Constitution, powers and functions, in each case, as may be specified in the law.	None
Any such law as is referred to in clause (1) shall not be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of article 368 notwithstanding that it contains any provision which amends or has the effect of amending this Constitution.	None
Article 239A empowered the Parliament by law to create a body to function as a Legislature for the Union Territory.	None
Such Union Territory constituted under Act, 1963 had Legislative power as provided by the Parliament itself under Section 18 of the Act, 1963.	None
Section 18 of the Act, 1963 is as follows Extent of legislative power.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory may make laws for the whole or any part of the Union territory with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the State List or the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution in so far as any such matter is applicable in relation to Union territories.	Arguments of Respondent
Nothing in subsection (1) shall derogate from the powers conferred on Parliament by the Constitution to make laws with respect to any matter for the Union territory or any part thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, the expression insofar as any such matter is applicable in relation to Union Territories is a known concept which was occurring in Section 18 of the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963 also.	None
For understanding the reasons and objects for circumscribing the Legislative powers of the Delhi Legislative Assembly by qualifying with the expression insofar as any such matter is applicable in relation to Union Territories , we need to look into the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Constitution 69 th (Amendment) Act and other relevant materials throwing light on the object and purpose of 69 th Constitutional amendment.	None
It is to be noted that for Reorganisation of the administrative set up of Union Territory of Delhi, the Government of India has appointed a Committee, namely, Balakrishnan Committee, which had submitted its report on 14.12.1989 to the Home Ministry.	None
The Report of the Balakrishnan Committee was the basis for enacting 69 th Constitution Amendment.	None
In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 69 th Constitution Amendment, the Report of Balakrishnan Committee has been specifically referred to and relied on.	None
It is useful to notice the Statement of Objects and Reasons of Constitution 69 th Amendment, which are as follows Statement of Objects and Reasons The question of reorganisation of the administrative setup in the Union Territory of Delhi has been under the consideration of the Government for some time.	None
The Government of India appointed on 24121987 a Committee to go into the various issues connected with the administration of Delhi and to recommend measures inter alia for the streamlining of the administrative setup.	None
The Committee went into the matter in great detail and considered the issues after holding discussions with various individuals, associations, political parties and other experts and taking into account the arrangements in the National Capitals of other countries with a federal setup and also the debates in the Constituent Assembly as also the reports by earlier Committees and Commissions.	None
After such detailed inquiry and examination, it recommended that Delhi should continue to be a Union Territory and provided with a Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers responsible to such Assembly with appropriate powers to deal with matters of concern to the common man.	None
The Committee also recommended that with a view to ensure stability and permanence the arrangements should be incorporated in the Constitution to give the National Capital a special status among the Union Territories.	None
The Bill seeks to give effect to the above proposals.	None
The Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Govt. of NCT of Delhi vs. Union of India (supra) speaking through Justice Dipak Misra, C.J. (as he then was) has also referred to and relied on the Balakrishnans Committee Report.	None
In Paragraph No. 16 of the judgment, several paragraphs of the Balakrishnan Committee Report have been extracted by the Constitution Bench.	None
The Constitution Bench has further held that Balakrishnan Committees Report serve as an enacting history and corpus of public knowledge relative to the introduction of Articles 239AA and 239AB and would be handy external aids for construing Article 239AA and unearthing the real intention of Parliament while exercising its constituent power.	None
In Paragraph No. 206 of the judgment, following has been observed It is perceptible that the constitutional amendment conceives of conferring special status on Delhi.	None
This has to be kept in view while interpreting Article 239AA.	None
Both the Statement of Objects and Reasons and the Balakrishnan Committee Report, the relevant extracts of which we have already reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment, serve as an enacting history and corpus of public knowledge relative to the introduction of Articles 239AA and 239AB and would be handy external aids for construing Article 239AA and unearthing the real intention of Parliament while exercising its constituent power.	None
Balakrishnans Committee Report in Para No. 6.7.4 has noted the limitation on the Legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly because of the difference between the Constitutional Status of Union Territory and that of the State.	None
Para No. 6.7.4 is to the following effect 6.7.4 As regards the Legislative Assembly to be created for Delhi.	None
It should have full legislative power in relation to matters assigned to it.	None
Subject to the specific exclusion of certain subjects set out in paragraphs 6.7.8 and 6.7.12 below, such powers should cover matters in the State List and the Concurrent List of the Constitution in so far as such matters are applicable in relation to Union territories.	None
This last limitation is necessary because of the difference between the constitutional status of a Union territory and that of a State.	None
The exercise of such legislative powers should, of course, be subject to the provisions of the Constitution and the relevant laws of Parliament.	None
Balakrishnan Committee Report while elaborating the expression insofar as any such matters are applicable in relation to Union Territories has noticed that apart from entries specifically excluded, there are other entries, which ipso facto fall outside the purview of the Delhi Legislative Assembly.	None
Following has been stated in Paragraph No. 6.7.12	None
6.7.12 Another connected Entry in the State List is Entry No.35 which is Works, lands and buildings vested in or in the possession of the State.	None
Considering that the powers of the Assembly proposed for Delhi will extend to matters in the State List and the Concurrent List of the Constitution in so far as such matters are applicable in relation to Union territories Entry 35 will ipso facto fall outside the purview of the Assembly proposed for Delhi because that Entry is applicable to States and not to Union territories	None
Entry 41 of List II of VIIth Schedule of the Constitution was specifically considered in the Balakrishnan Committee Report and the Balakrishnan Committee Report opined that the said entry is not applicable to the Union Territory.	None
On the above subject, following was stated in the Report in Paragraph Nos.	None
8.1.2 and 8.1.3 8.1.2 Entry 41 of the State List mentions State public services State Public Services Commission.	None
Obviously, this Entry is not applicable to Union territories because it mentions only State and not Union territories.	None
This view is reinforced by the fact that this Constitution divides public services in India into two categories, namely, services in connection with the affairs of the Union and services in connection with the affairs of the State as is clear from the various provisions in Part XIV of the Constitution.	None
There is no third category of services covering the services of the Union territories.	None
The obvious reason is that the administration of the Union territory is the constitutional responsibility of the Union under article 239 and as such comes under affairs of the Union.	None
Consequently, the public services for the administration of any Union territory should form part of the public services in connection with the affairs of the Union.	None
8.1.3	None
It is not, therefore, constitutionally possible to bring the subject matter of the services in the Union territory within the scope of the Legislative Assembly or the Council of Ministers of the proposed Delhi Administration.	None
On the same reasoning it is not possible to provide for a separate Public Service Commission for a Union territory like Delhi because State Public Service Commission in Entry 41 aforesaid means only the body set up for the States.	None
Balakrishnan Committee Report further opined that services in connection with the administration of the Union Territory of Delhi will be part of the services of the Union even after the setting up of a Legislative Assembly with a Council of Ministers.	None
Following was stated in Paragraph No. 9.3.4 on the heading SERVICES SERVICES 9.3.4 By virtue of the provisions in the Constitution, services in connection with the administration of the Union territory of Delhi will be part of the services of the Union even after the setting up of a Legislative Assembly with a Council of Ministers.	None
This constitutional position is unexceptionable and should not be disturbed.	None
There should, however, be adequate delegation of powers to the Lt. Governor in respect of specified categories of services or posts.	None
In performing his functions under such delegated powers the Lt. Governor will have to act in his discretion but there should be a convention of consultation, whenever possible, with the Chief Minister.	None
The Balakrishnan Committee Report which led into passing of the 69 th Constitution (Amendment) Act categorically has accepted the position that Entry 41 of List II shall not be within the Legislative competence of Delhi Legislature, which conclusion was plausible, since the Legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly was circumscribed by the expression insofar as any such matter is applicable in relation to Union Territories as occurring in Article 239AA(3).	None
In Balakrishnan Committee Report, the Committee noticed the existence of services, which were in existence in the Union Territory of Delhi.	None
There were common services for several Union Territories constituted by Union.	None
On 13.07.1959, the President has issued an order in exercise of power conferred by Proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution and framed Rules namely, Conditions of Services of Union Territories Employees Rules, 1959.	None
The Delhi Administration Subordinate Ministerial Executive Service Rules., 1967 were also framed by the President in exercise of power conferred by Article 309 of the Constitution of India.	None
Rule 2(d) provided that commission means the Union Public Services Commission.	None
There has been subsequent Rules framed for services under the Union Territories.	None
There being also Rules for Services combined to different Union Territories.	None
The Parliament was well aware at the time when Constitution 69 th (Amendment) Act was enacted that the term services in the Union Territories are Union Services and there are no State services and the Commission for Services means the Union Public Services Commission.	None
A Constitution Bench of this Court had occasion to consider various aspects of the services in Union Territory of Delhi in Bir Singh Vs.	None
Delhi Jal Board and Others, (2018) 10 SCC 312.	None
The above Constitution Bench judgment was delivered on 30.08.2018, i.e. subsequent to Constitution Bench judgment in Govt.	None
of NCT of Delhi vs. Union of India (supra).	None
The Constitution Bench of this Court speaking through Justice Ranjan Gogoi (as he then was) has noticed details of all Central Civil Services, Union Territories Services in reference to NCT of Delhi, although with reference to question of applicability of reservation in services.	None
Services in reference to NCT of Delhi has been noticed in paragraph Nos. 64 to 66 under the heading National Capital Territory of Delhi, which is to the following effect National Capital Territory of Delhi In case of National Capital Territory of Delhi, especially, to make the picture even clearer, a reference may be made to Delhi Administration Subordinate Service Rules, 1967.	None
Rule 3 of the aforesaid Rules is to the following effect Constitution of service and its classification.	None
On and from the date of commencement of these Rules, there shall be constituted one Central Civil Service, known as the Subordinate Service of the Delhi Administration.	None
The Service shall have four Grades, namely Grade I Grade II Grade III Grade IV The posts in Grade I shall be Central Civil posts, Class II Group B (Gazetted) and those in Grades II, III and IV shall be Central Civil posts Group C (NonGazetted).	None
Members of the service shall, in the normal course be eligible for appointment to various Grades of the service to which they belong and not to the other service.	None
(emphasis supplied) Subordinate services in the National Capital Territory of Delhi are, therefore, clearly Central Civil Services.	None
The affidavit of the Union of India also points out this feature by stating that, The posts in CCS Group C are in the subordinate services.	None
The equivalent in the Union Territory of Delhi is the Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services (DASS) and the recruiting agency in the place of Staff Selection Commission is the Delhi Subordinate Service Selection Board (DSSSB).	None
Members of the Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services are the feeder cadre for Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS).	None
It is for these reasons that the policy (of pan India eligibility) is consistently adopted.66.	None
A combined reading of these provisions of the DASS Rules, 1967 and CCS Rules, 1965, therefore, more than adequately explains the nature of Subordinate Services in the NCT of Delhi.	None
These clearly are General Central Services and perhaps, it is owing to this state of affairs that the Union of India in its affidavit has stated that, Members of the Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services are the feeder cadre for Central Civil Services Group B (DANICS).	None
It is for these reasons that the policy (of pan India eligibility) is consistently adopted.	None
The Constitution Bench in Bir Singh (supra), thus, has opined that services in the National Capital Territory are clearly Central Civil Services.	None
What has been held by the Constitution Bench also reinforces that there are no State Public Services in the NCT, Delhi.	None
Learned counsel appearing for the appellant has placed much reliance on the Delhi Fire Services Act, 2007 to buttress his submission that by the aforesaid Act, State Services namely Delhi Fire Services has been created, which clearly means that Entry 41 of List II is applicable to Delhi Legislative Assembly.	None
The Delhi Fire Services Act, 2007 has been passed to provide for the maintenance of a fire service and to make more effective provisions for the fire prevention and fire safety measures in certain buildings and premises in the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the matter connected therewith.	None
We may first notice that the word services used in the Act has been used in a manner of providing services for fire prevention and fire safety measures.	None
The word services has not been used in a sense of constitution of a service.	None
It is to be noted that fire service is a municipal function performed by local authority.	None
Delhi Municipal Council Act, 1957 contains various provisions dealing with prevention of fire etc.	None
Further fire services is a municipal function falling within the domain of municipalities, which has been recognised in the Constitution of India.	None
Article 243(W) of the Constitution deals with functions of the municipalities in relation to matters listed in the 12 th Schedule.	None
Entry 7 of the 12 th Schedule provides for Fire Services as one of the functions of the municipalities.	None
The nature of the enactment and the provisions clearly indicate that Delhi Fire Services Act falls under Entry 5 of List II and not under Entry 41 of List II.	None
The distribution of Legislative powers of State and the Parliament is provided under Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution.	None
Article 246 which provides for subjectmatter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States provides as follows Article 246.	None
Subject matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States.	None
Notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3), Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the Union List).	None
Notwithstanding anything in clause (3), Parliament and, subject to clause (1), the Legislature of any State also, have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the Concurrent List).	None
Subject to clauses (1) and (2), the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule (in this Constitution referred to as the State List).	None
Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List.	None
It is relevant to notice that Article 246 clause (3) which provides for exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof, uses the expression with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule .	None
The expression used in Article 239AA(3)(a) i.e. in so far as any such matter is applicable to Union Territories connotes different expression.	None
There is a difference between the Legislative powers of the State and the Union Territories, which is apparent by use of different expressions in the Constitution.	None
While inserting Article 239AA in the Constitution, the Parliament was well aware about the functioning of the Union Territories and extent and controls of powers to be given to the Union Territories by constitutional amendment.	None
I having held that Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution is not available to the Legislative Assembly of GNCTD, there is no occasion to exercise any Executive power with regard to Services by the GNCTD, since the Executive power of the GNCTD as per Article 239AA(4) extend in relation to matters with respect to which Legislative Assembly has power to make laws.	None
With regard to Services GNCTD can exercise only those Executive powers, which can be exercised by it under any law framed by the Parliament or it may exercise those Executive powers, which have been delegated to it.	None
Issue No. 1 is answered accordingly.	None
In view of my above answer to Issue No.1, Civil Appeal No. 2357 of 2017 Govt.	None
Of NCT of Delhi Vs. Union of India stands disposed of upholding the judgment of the Delhi High Court dismissing the Writ Petition (C) No. 5888 of 2015.	Decision
The other appeals are disposed of as per order proposed by my esteemed Brother Justice A.K. Sikri.	Decision
