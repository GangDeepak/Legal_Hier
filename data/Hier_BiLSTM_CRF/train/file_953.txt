7.ponsibilities entrusted Mr. C.U. Singh, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, assailed the order passed by the High Court on various grounds inter alia, the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction conferred upon it under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by reversing the finding recorded by the Tribunal.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel submitted that the High Court has committed grave error in issuing suo motu directions to the executive to amend a relevant provision of Section 2(z) of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act (in short, State Act).	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, issuing such direction by the High Court amounts to issue a direction to the legislature to enact a law in a particular manner.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel submitted that the High Court cannot mandate the executive to introduce or enact a legislation, howsoever necessary or desirable.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel drew our attention to the provisions of Section 2(z) of the said Act which defines workman and submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the nature of duties and resupon the respondent are not manual, skilled or unskilled or technical services, but manual, managerial and supervisory.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the capacity of Fleet Executive, respondent was required to monitor each and every vehicle of the Fleet and ensure that the necessary repair proceedings were carried out.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel further submitted that the High Court has misdirected itself in considering the relevant facts and pleadings which were not even placed before the Industrial Tribunal.	Arguments of Petitioner
Lastly, it was contended that the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution ought not reappreciate or reweigh evidence and disturb the finding of facts recorded by the Tribunal based on appreciation of evidence.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel relied upon the judgment of this Court in the case of Chandavarkar Sita Ratna Rao vs. Ashalata S. Guram, (1986) 4 SCC 447 , Birla Corpn.	Arguments of Petitioner

3 SCC 510.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Kavin Gulati, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent firstly contended that before conciliation, the appellant raised an objection with regard to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the matter was finally referred to the Labour Court for adjudication on a limited question as to whether the termination of services of the respondent was justified.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the learned counsel, the appellantmanagement cannot raise the question of jurisdiction of the Labour Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel referred to Rule 12 of the Industrial Disputes Rules in support of his contention and relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of M s. U.P. Electric Supply Co., Ltd. vs. The Workmen of M s. S.N. Choudhary Contractors and Anr., (1960) 3 SCR page 189.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Gulati, learned senior counsel also relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of TISCO Ltd. v. State of Jharkhand, (2014) 1 SCC 536 , and Bhogpur Coop Sugar Mills Ltd. vs. Harmesh Kumar, (2006) 13 SCC 28 , for the proposition that the Labour Court has limited jurisdiction to adjudicate the disputes referred to it and not to enter into any other question that may be raised in the reference.	Arguments of Respondent
We have heard learned counsel for both the parties and considered the relevant facts and the law applicable thereto.	None
The admitted facts are that at the relevant time, the respondent was working as a Fleet Supervisor and drawing a salary of Rs. 7716/.	Reasoning
Initially, he was appointed as a technician GradeIII in 1995 on the salary of Rs. 2600/ per month and after getting increment his salary was increased.	Reasoning
By giving one months salary, in lieu of the notice, his services were terminated.	None
It appears that the appellant raised a preliminary objection before the Labour Court that the respondent was not a Labour as defined under Section 2(z) of the said Act and the Deputy Labour Commissioner, Lucknow, who had referred the present case, was not competent for this purpose.	None
The Labour Court recorded the evidence adduced by both the appellant and the respondent and discussed the evidence, and elaborately considered the case of the parties.	None
The Labour Court finally recorded finding that the respondent is not a workman within the meaning of Section 2(z) of the Act.	None
Paras 13 to 15 of the order are reproduced hereinbelow	None
The statement of the Applicant is that although he was given the post in the name of Fleet Executive and he was posted at the warehouse at Lucknow, however practically he was doing the work of skilled manual and as such he fall within the definition as given in Section 2(z) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.	None
According to him his main work was to remove the technical defects at 100 from the fleet.	None
His other works which have been mentioned by the management in their written statement, were secondary.	None
It has also been stated that the written statement of the management is not on affidavit, therefore the same cannot be relied upon.	None
He was executing all his work in accordance with the directions of the higher officials.	None
He was not having any right of doing the work as per his own wishes.	None
He has stated in his statement that no staff was working under him.	None
He used to do the work himself for keeping the vehicles 100 free available from technical deformities and removed the difficulties of the vehicles.	None
It has also been stated that there is a difference in the statement of witnesses of the management EW1 and EW2 regarding the repair of the work of the company and the same cannot be relied upon.	None
It has been stated while relying upon the legal arrangement given by the Honble Supreme Court in S.K. Verma Vs. Mahesh Chander (AIR SC1462) and Shri Verma Role Offer Storage and Distribution Co. of	None
India Ltd.	None
Vs.	None
Vermashel Management Staff Association and others (1970) 3 SCC 378	None
that any personnel fall within the definition of labour or not, it depends upon the fact that what is the nature of the main works being done by him.	None
The same cannot be assessed with the name of the post.	None
If the concerned person is doing the work of manual skilled unskilled work, then he is in the definition of labour, as the main work of the Applicant was to repair the vehicles, which he used to do from his own hands.	None
No other person was working under him and he was not having the right to take decision by himself.	None
Therefore, he falls within the definition of Labour.	None
It has been stated while referring the S.K. Verma Vs. Mahesh Chander and Vermashel Air Storage and Distribution Co. of India Ltd., Vs. Vermashel Management Staff Association (supra) that the work of the Applicant was similar to fupelling superintendent, which has been considered by the Honble Apex Court as labour, because his work was manual and not supervisory.	None
Therefore he falls within the definition of labour and the termination of service made by the management is retrenchment, which has been done in violation of the provisions of Section 60N of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.	None
Therefore his termination of service is improper and illegal.	None
On this basis he may be reinstated in service alongwith salary for leave period.14.	None
It has been argued on behalf of Management that out of the works executed by the Applicant on the post of Fleet Executive, the details of the paid work are mentioned in their written statement.	None
The same has been admitted by the Applicant in his arguments.	None
In this manner, the details regarding the main work out of the works on the post of Fleet Executive being done by him is proved.	None
All these works are supervisory in nature.	None
The major work of repair of the vehicle used to be done from outside.	None
The work of washing and cleaning of the vehicles was done by driver.	None
The Applicant has never done any type of repairing work and neither anybody has seen the Applicant while doing such work.	None
In this manner mainly the Applicant was doing the work of supervisory nature.	None
Therefore does not fall within the definition of labour.	None
His services have been terminated under the terms.	None
In this manner the order of termination of his service is proper and legal.	None
He is not entitled to get any relief.15.	None
The main question in this industrial dispute is whether the Applicant K.K. Pandey is a labour, as claimed by him, as this claim has been made by him and as such onus to prove the same lies on him.	None
According to para 11 and 12 of his written statement he was having only one responsibility on the post of fleet executive that he was to ensure the availability of the vehicles free from technical deformities.	None
According to the written statement for this work nobody was working under him and he used to do the work of repair with his own hands.	None
He has reiterated this fact in his statement also.	None
In this regard except his statement has not produced any evidence to confirm the same.	None
On the other hand he has admitted in his arguments as regards the details of different works mentioned by the management in para No.1 of their written statement.	None
According to it out of his works, there is a detail of 15 main works.	None
In this manner the statement made by the Applicant regarding his main work remained rebutted.	None
The statement of the Applicant regarding the post of Fleet Executive on the basis of which he is claiming himself as labour is not liable to be believed.	None
On the basis of the findings based on elaborate discussions and analyzing the evidence, the Labour Court came to the conclusion that at the relevant time the respondent was working as a Fleet Executive which is supervisory in nature and does not fall within the definition of labour as defined under Section 2(z) of the Act.	None
Hence, he is not entitled to any relief.	None
The respondent challenged the aforesaid award passed by the Labour Court in a writ petition before the High Court.	None
After considering the definition contained in Section 2(z) of the Act and the nature of work assigned to the respondent, the High Court arrived at a conclusion that the nature of work prevalent on the date of termination was as that of a workman.	Reasoning
Curiously enough, though the respondent did not come under the definition of workman under Section 2(z) of the Act, the High Court proceeded on the basis that the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act was enacted in 1947 and although the respondent cannot be held to be a workman under the said definition, held that he shall have to be classified as a workman and directed the Government to make amendment in Section 2(z) of the Act excluding some of the clauses.	Reasoning
For better appreciation, relevant portion of the order is quoted hereinbelow There is one more exclusion clause in section 2(z) of the Act i.e. Clause (iv) which excludes the employee who being employed in supervisory capacity draws wages exceeding Rs. 500/ per mensem or exercise, either by the nature of the duties attached to the office or by reason of the powers vested in him, functions mainly of a managerial in nature.	None
It is very much obvious that by nature of duties assigned to the petitioner, it cannot be said that he was attached to the office or mainly managerial function was vested with him.	None
So far as another condition for exclusion from the definition of workman viz drawing wages exceeding Rs. 500/ per mensem is concerned, it is not in dispute that the petitioner on the date of retrenchment had been getting more Rs.	None
500/ mensem.	None
This clause is a part of original form of the definition of workman as is provided under section 2 (z) of the Act.	None
The U. P. Industrial Disputes Act was enacted in 1947.	None
The petitioner was retrenched from service in 2003.	None
The date of his initial appointment is on 13th of March, 1995.	None
By passage of time the GDP growth had been increased in number of times from 1947 to 2003.	None
Therefore, the enhancement in income was a natural corollary, in the light of which, I am of the view that this clause has become unworkable and redundant.	None
Now every workman working in the Industry definitely would have been getting more than Rs. 500/ per mensem and if this clause is permitted to be prevailed no workman shall be governed under the definition of workman.	None
Therefore, I am of the view that this clause has lost its significance and if the employee is covered under the definition of workman as is defined under Section 2 (z) of the U. P. Industrial Disputes Act and further is not covered under the exclusion clause except clause (iv), he shall be classified as workman.	None
The clause (iv) of section 2 (z) shall not come in the way of his categorization as workman.	None
It is advisable to the State Government to consider to make an amendment in section 2 (z) of the U. P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 in general and to exclude the class (iv) from the exclusion in particular.	None
Since the present petitioner has been classified by this court, as above, under the definition of workman the order impugned dated 24th of August, 2007 passed by the Industrial Tribunal II, State of U. P., Lucknow is hereby quashed with the direction to the Tribunal to proceed with the adjudication case No. 82/2004 to adjudicate upon it on merit.	None
Considering the entire facts of the case and the findings recorded by the Labour Court, prima facie we are of the view that the High Court has exceeded in exercise of its jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India in interfering with the finding of facts recorded by the Labour Court.	None
It is well settled that the High Court in the guise of exercising its jurisdiction normally should not interfere under Article 227 of the Constitution and convert itself into a court of appeal.	None
While discussing the power of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution interfering with the facts recorded by the courts or the tribunal, this Court in the case of Chandavarkar S.R. Rao vs. Ashalata S. Guram, (supra) held as under  	None
In case of finding of facts, the court should not interfere in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution.	None
Reference may be made to the observations of this Court in Bathutmal Raichand Oswal v. Laxmibai R. Tarta where this Court observed that the High Court could not in the guise of exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 convert itself into a court of appeal when the legislature has not conferred a right of appeal.	None
The High Court picwas not competent to correct errors of facts by examining the evidence and reappreciating.	None
Speaking for the Court, Bhagwati, J. as the learned Chief Justice then was, observed at p. 1301 of the report as follows (SCC p. 864, para 7)	None
The special civil application preferred by the appellant was admittedly an application under Article 227 and it is, therefore, material only to consider the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the High Court under that article.	None
Did the High Court have jurisdiction in an application under Article 227 to disturb the findings of fact reached by the District Court?	None
It is well settled by the decision of this Court in Waryam Singh v. Amarnath that the power of superintendence conferred by Article 227 is, as pointed out by Harries, C.J., in Dalmia Jain Airways v. Sukumar Mukherjee to be exercised most sparingly and only in appropriate cases in order to keep the subordinate courts within the bounds of their authority and not for correcting mere errors.	None
This statement of law was quoted with approval in the subsequent decision of this Court in Nagendra Nath Bose v. Commr. of Hills Division and it was pointed out by Sinha, J., as he then was, speaking on behalf of the court in that caseIt is thus, clear that the powers of judicial interference under Article 227 of the Constitution with orders of judicial or quasijudicial nature, are not greater than the power under Article 226 of the Constitution.	None
Under Article 226 the power of interference may extend to quashing an impugned order on the ground of a mistake apparent on the face of the record.	None
But under Article 227 of the Constitution, the power of interference is limited to seeing that the tribunal functions within the limits of its authority.	None
In the case of Birla Corpn. Ltd vs. Rajeshwar Mahato and Others, (2001) 10 SCC, the question of validity of termination of services of the respondent by the appellantCorporation was referred to the Industrial Tribunal.	None
On evidence, the Industrial Tribunal found that the duties of the respondent were mainly managerial or administrative.	None
The Tribunal held that the respondent was not a workman and the reference was therefore not maintainable against the decision of the Tribunal.	None
The Tribunal relying on Section 2(s)(iv) (as amended in West Bengal W.B.) held that as the respondent was drawing salary less than Rs.1600/ per month, he had to be regarded as a workman.	None
The Corporation moved this Court against the order of the High Court.	None
This Court while setting aside the decision of the High Court held as under  It was not in dispute that at the time of the termination of services of Respondent 1, he was receiving Rs 1185 per month by way of salary.	None
The Tribunal recorded the evidence as well as took into consideration documentary evidence which was produced by the parties.	None
On the basis of the evidence which was adduced before it, the Tribunal observed thatThe main duties of Shri Rajeshwar Mahato were both supervisory and administrative in nature.	None
In the instant case, Shri Mahatos functions were mainly of a managerial nature.	None
He had control as well as supervision over the work of the jute mill workers working under him.11.	None
As we have also noticed hereinabove, the Tribunal had given a categorical finding to the effect that Respondent 1s function was mainly of managerial nature.	None
His duties were both supervisory and administrative and therefore he was regarded as not being a workman.	None
Though the Tribunal did not specifically state so, it is evident that it is because of Section 2(s)(iii) that Respondent 1 was regarded as not being a workman.12.	None
Neither the Single Judge nor the Division Bench of the High Court, as we have already noticed, referred to this aspect of the matter.	None
Even assuming that the West Bengal amendment was applicable, that would still not help to hold Respondent 1 as a workman if the finding of the Tribunal with regard to the nature of the duties performed by him, as arrived at by the Tribunal, is not set aside as being frivolous or without any evidence.	None
As long as the finding of the Tribunal stands, namely, that the respondent was an employee mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity, the award of the Tribunal could not have been set aside.	None
As we have already observed the Single Judge or even the Division Bench could have come to the conclusion that the finding so arrived at by the Tribunal was either frivolous or not based on any evidence.	None
But this aspect of the case was completely overlooked by the High Court.	None
The emphasis of the Single Judge as well as the Division picBench was only with regard to applicability of the amendment of the State of West Bengal to Section 2(s) of the Industrial Disputes Act.	None
In our opinion, therefore, the High Court erred in allowing on this ground the writ petition filed by Respondent 1.	None
The decision of the High Court is set aside and the writ petition filed therein by the respondent stands dismissed.	None
In the case of Indian Overseas Bank vs. I.O.B. Staff Canteen Workers Union and Another, (2000) 4 SCC 245 , this Court considered a similar question with regard to the power of the High Court under Article 226 against the findings recorded by the Industrial Tribunal.	None
Reversing the decision of the Single Judge and restoring the fact finding decision of the Tribunal this, Court held  The learned Single Judge seems to have undertaken an exercise, impermissible for him in exercising writ jurisdiction, by liberally reappreciating the evidence and drawing conclusions of his own on pure questions of fact, unmindful, though aware fully, that he is not exercising any appellate jurisdiction over the awards passed by a tribunal, presided over by a judicial officer.	None
The findings of fact recorded by a factfinding authority duly picconstituted for the purpose and which ordinarily should be considered to have become final, cannot be disturbed for the mere reason of having been based on materials or evidence not sufficient or credible in the opinion of the writ court to warrant those findings, at any rate, as long as they are based upon some material which are relevant for the purpose or even on the ground that there is yet another view which can reasonably and possibly be taken.	None
The Division Bench was not only justified but well merited in its criticism of the order of the learned Single Judge and in ordering restoration of the award of the Tribunal.	None
On being taken through the findings of the Industrial Tribunal as well as the order of the learned Single Judge and the judgment of the Division Bench, we are of the view that the Industrial Tribunal had overwhelming materials which constituted ample and sufficient basis for recording its findings, as it did, and the manner of consideration undertaken, the objectivity of approach adopted and reasonableness of findings recorded seem to be unexceptionable.	None
The only course, therefore, open to the writ Judge was to find out the satisfaction or otherwise of the relevant criteria laid down by this Court, before sustaining the claim of the canteen workmen, on the facts found and recorded by the factfinding authority and not embark upon an exercise of reassessing the evidence and arriving at findings of ones own, altogether giving a complete goby even to the facts specifically found by the Tribunal below.	None
The order of the Tribunal would show that the respondentworkman accepted different works assigned to him which were purely of supervisory and managerial nature.	Reasoning
The details of 15 managerial supervisory works assigned to the respondent have been analyzed by the Tribunal which finally came to the conclusionc that the respondent is not a workman within the meaning of Section 2(z) of the At.17.	Reasoning
In exercise of its writ jurisdiction, the High Court proceeded initially on the basis that the appellant had entered into service on the post of Operator Technician GradeIII, which is a technical post and from there he was promoted to different posts including Fleet Executive.	Reasoning
The High Court committed grave error in holding that although he is not covered under the definition of workman as defined under Section 2(z) of the Act he shall be classified as a workman.	Reasoning
The High Court further exceeded its jurisdiction in advising the Government to make an amendment in Section 2(z) of the Act and to exclude some clauses.	Reasoning
The order passed by the High Court cannot be sustained in law.	Reasoning
We, therefore, allow this appeal and set aside the order of the High Court and restore the order passed by the Tribunal.	Decision
However, we give liberty to the respondent to move the appropriate forum to challenge, in accordance with law, the order of termination passed by the appellant.	Decision
