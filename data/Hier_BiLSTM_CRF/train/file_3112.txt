We had the benefit of hearing Shri N. Natarajan, learned counsel for the appellants who argued the appeal with considerable perspicuity and resource and an equally forceful and realistic argument advanced by Shri U. R. Lalit, learned counsel appearing for the State Government.	None
Apart from questioning the credibility and trustworthiness of PW 18 Smt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Kanaka, the flower vendor, whom the learned counsel for the appellants characterised as a got up witness by the prosecution to furnish the missing links in the chain of circumstances, as well as the alleged recoveries of Rs. 4, 500/ effected by PW 50 Deviasigamani, Inspector of Police from the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty at My Ladys Park, Madras on May 29, 1983 and of the amount of Rs. 12, 27, 500/ from appellant No. 2 Shivaram Shetty, he endeavoured to create doubts and difficulties as to the truthfulness of the entire prosecution case.	Arguments of Petitioner
He contends that the prosecution case regarding the recovery of the stolen amount at Madras stands falsified by the news item carried in the Indian Express, Malai Murasu and Makkal Kural of the 29th and Dina Thanthi of the 30th showing that the entire amount had been recovered from the residence of appellant 2 Shivaram Shetty and both the accused had been taken into custody.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel also brought out several improbabilities in the prosecution case.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that the accused had left Madras by the West Coast Express on the 22nd morning and reached Mangalore on the next day i.e. on the 23rd.	Arguments of Petitioner
If that be so, both the father and the son were freely moving about at Mangalore till the 26th evening.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the 23rd they paid a visit to the clinic of PW 11 Dr. Madhava Bhandari as the accused was complaining of stomach disorder and thereafter on the 25th evening they called on PW 10 P. Raghuram, Chairman of the Bank who advised the accused to return to Madras at once.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was not till the 26th evening that the accused boarded the West Coast Express.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel contends that if really PW 50 became aware from recording of the statement of PW 18 on the 25th evening at 4 p.m. that the accused was the person involved in the commission of murder and robbery, he would have at once flashed a message to the Mangalore police to intercept him particularly in view of the fact that a huge amount of about Rs. 14 lakhs was stolen from the Bank.	Arguments of Petitioner
On their own showing, a police party consisting of PW 50 accompanied by PW 49 instead left for Mangalore in the early hours of 26th morning, reaching there at 9.30 p.m. and contacted the local police and thereafter conducted a raid at the house of appellant 2 in the early hours of the 27th at 1 a.m.	Arguments of Petitioner
The police would necessarily have known from the railway reservation that the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty under the assumed name of his father Shivaram Shetty, had boarded the West Coast Express for Madras on the 26th.	Arguments of Petitioner
They would have immediately contacted the Madras police and intercepted the accused on his arrival at the Madras Central on the 27th afternoon at 4 p.m.	Arguments of Petitioner
The submission is that this lends credence to the testimony of PW 9 Govindaraj that the accused arrived by the West Coast Express on the 27th afternoon and was taken into custody by the police.	Arguments of Petitioner
We are expected to believe, the learned counsel argues, that the accused was freely roaming about in Madras between the 27th and the 29th till he was taken into custody at My Ladys Park.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is therefore submitted that the prosecution evidence of the socalled recovery of the incriminating currency notes worth Rs. 4, 5000/ from the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty could not be true.	Arguments of Petitioner
As regards the testimony of PW 18 Smt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Kanaka, the flower vendor, the learned counsel submits that it is somewhat strange that from nowhere this witness appeared on the scene on the evening of the 21st to bring out the circumstance that the accused was the person last seen leaving Bank premises on the 20th night at 9 p.m. If really PW 47 had derived knowledge from Ganesan, the plumber, that PW 18 might furnish a vital clue which would lead to the detection of the murderer, it was expected from PW 47 and PW 48, who took over the investigation from him, that they would make every effort to track down PW 18 or her husband.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is difficult to believe that PW 47 would not proceed to Vyasarpadi on the 21st night which is only seven kilometres from the police station.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the learned counsel contends that the repeated visits made by PWs 47 and 48 to Tharamani when on their own showing they knew that PW 18 had gone to her sisters house at Vyasarpadi, creates considerable doubt about his version.	Arguments of Petitioner
Nor did they take the trouble to track down her husband Neerappan from the Krishna Bhawan Hotel which was just two furlongs from the police station.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, the cumulative effect of all these circumstances taken together renders it extremely unsafe to rely on the sole testimony of PW 18 unless it was corroborated in material particulars by evidence of an independent character.	None
In reply Shri U. R. Lalit, learned counsel for the respondent mainly contends that even if the prosecution evidence regarding the recoveries were to be discarded there was ample material brought on record which raises an inference of guilt of the appellants.	Arguments of Respondent
Broadly stated, the learned counsel in substance, advance a twofold submission, namely (i)	Arguments of Respondent
The course of investigation during which it was revealed that PW 18 Smt.	Arguments of Respondent
Kanka had information which might result in solving the murder, and (ii) The fact as deposed by PW 18 that the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty was the person last seen leaving the Bank premises after locking the front door and the shutter on the fateful night at about 9 p.m. taken in conjunction with the prosecution evidence regarding his conduct and movement afterwards, clearly show that he alone and no one else could have committed the murder because both he and the deceased were the persons working late on that night.	Arguments of Respondent
As regards the news item which appeared in the Indian Express and the other regional papers showing that the entire amount stolen from the Bank had been recovered on a search of the house of appellant No. 2 Shivaram Shetty at Mangalore and that they have both been taken into custody, the learned counsel contends that the news item has no evidentiary value and cannot be taken into consideration.	Arguments of Respondent
It is pointed out that the defence had not examined the reporters who had gathered the news appearing in the newspapers and authenticate the version though the reporters had been summoned.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, in a case of this nature, the Court cannot reject the other reliable and credible evidence led in accordance with law merely on the publication of this kind of unauthenticated news item in the press.	Arguments of Respondent
It is said that if the Court were to act on such news item though not brought into evidence in accordance with law and were inclined to dispose of a case on such news item, then the Court had either to convict a person or acquit him on such publication of news item ignoring the overwhelming legal evidence brought on record.	Arguments of Respondent
There is in our opinion, considerable force in his submissions.	None
The law relating to the proof of a case based purely on circumstantial evidence has been settled by several authorities of this Court as well as of the High Court.	None
In Earabhadrappa v. State of Karnataka, 1983 2 SCC 330 (AIR 1983 SC 446 at p. 448)	None
it was observed In cases in which the evidence is purely of a circumstantial nature, the facts and circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is sought to be drawn must be fully established beyond any reasonable doubt and the circumstances so established should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but they must in their effect be such as to be entirely incompatible with the innocence of the accused and must exclude a reasonable hypothesis with his innocence.	None
Shri Natarajan, learned counsel appearing for the appellants rightly points out that in such cases there is always the danger that conjecture or suspicion may take the place of legal proof and draws our attention to the caution administered by Baron Alderson to the jury in the oftquoted passage in Reg v. Hodge, 1838 2 Lew 227 where it was said The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one connected whole and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matters, to overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is therefore well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.	None
Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.	None
In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.	None
In spite of the forceful arguments addressed to us by the learned counsel for the appellants, we have not been able to discover any infirmity in the reasoning or the conclusions arrived at by the learned Additional Sessions Judge or the High Court.	None
Nor can it be said that they have just fallen into an error against which caution was administered by Baron Alderson in Reg v. Hodge.	None
The learned counsel began his address by stating that if we were to accept the conclusion arrived at by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court that there was nothing to impeach the credibility of PW 18 Smt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Kanaka, the flower vendor as a truthful witness and that her evidence was such as to accord with the ordinary course of events and human nature, it would tend to tilt the balance against the appellants.	Arguments of Petitioner
That really furnishes a key to the entire prosecution case.	None
We have therefore minutely been taken through the testimony of PW 18 Smt.	None
Kanaka by learned counsel for the parties who presented their respective points of view with consummate skill, and after going through her evidence over and over again we have no doubt whatever that the Courts below were perfectly justified in reaching the conclusion that she was a witness of truth and there was no reason to discard her testimony or that of the other prosecution witnesses.	None
Once the version of PW 18 Smt.	None
Kanaka that the accused was the person last seen leaving the Bank premises on the 20th night at 9 p.m. is accepted with all his subsequent movements, it would be seen that every other circumstance appearing from the evidence of the other prosecution witnesses fits in and it lends support to the irresistible inference drawn from the attendant facts and circumstances by the Courts below that the deceased Gnanasambandham was done to death by no one else except the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty and that both the accused were guilty of the offences with which they were charged.	Arguments of Respondent
We shall briefly enumerate the circumstances arising from the evidence adduced by the prosecution The accused had occasion to learn the method of operating the safety vault.	None
It transpires from the evidence of PW 3 P. T. Rajan, Chief Manager and Regional Development Officer of the Bank that in that building the Regional Develoment Office was functioning on the second floor.	None
The Main Branch was on the first floor and the ground floor was used as car park and godown.	None
The strong room was on a mezzanine floor over the first floor and reached by a flight of stairs.	None
The walls of the strong room were constructed with RCC.	None
There was an iron door fixed to that room supplied by Godrej company of the thickness of 3 having a dimension of 6 ft. x 3 ft.	None
There was a rotating wheel fitted to the iron door.	None
It had to be turned to the right and then both the sets of keys inserted in the upper and lower key holes.	None
On the lever being released the iron door would open outside.	None
Inside there was another door with a lock attached and it would open inside.	None
The strong room was divided by a partition wall with a wooden door.	None
In one portion of the strong room there were safe deposit lockers.	None

blank term deposit receipts, cheque books, drafts etc.	None
When the Bank closed the outer glass door had to be locked and then the shutter pulled down and locked at various places from outside.	None
It is in evidence that there was no night watchman of the Bank.	None
It appears from the testimony of PW 8 Ananthakrishnan, PW 9 Govindaraj, PW 12 Balasubramaniam and PW 16 Chandrasekara Holla that the accused gathered knowledge about the manner in which the strong room could be operated.	None
It is clear from their evidence that access to the strong room could not be had except by a person acquainted with the manner in which it was operated.	None
According to these witnesses the accused got an opportunity when in the first week of April, the wife and children of PW 8 Ananthakrishnan, Bank Manager visited the Bank and evinced a desire to see how the safety vault was operated.	None
While he was going up the stairs along with the members of his family and PW 12 Balasubramaniam, attendant, the accused who was standing with PW 9, expressed a desire to come up and see the strong room.	None
Although taken aback at the unusual request, PW 8 permitted them to come up.	None
With his inquisitiveness the accused cleared all his doubts about the mode of operating the safety vault and gained sufficient knowledgeFrom the evidence of PWs 5, 6, 9, 12 and 16 it is amply cleat that the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty gained the confidence of the deceased as a busy and hardworking young man by remaining in the premises and continuing to work even after the banking hours and assisting the deceased in disposing of the days work.	None
He also had knowledge about the availability of the first set of keys of the strong room with the deceased and must have noticed that PW 16 Chandrasekara Holla, who had the custody of the second set of keys, was in the habit of leaving them in the cupboard of his Godrej table.	None
It appears from the evidence of PW 15 V. Kannan, Manager in the Physical Development Institute that on the 20th at about 6 p.m. the accused left the Institute within half an hour after doing some exercises.	None
Further, the accused had the opportunity of knowing the cash balance available in the Bank on the 20th night from the Cash Scroll Register Exh. P8 which was kept open on the table of PW 6, which was adjacent to the table of the accused.	None
The fact that the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty was last seen leaving the Bank premises.	None
The testimony of PW 18, Smt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Kanaka, the flower vendor, tends to show that after finishing the days work, she came and sat or the steps of the Bank.	None
At about 9 p.m. she saw the accused coming out of the Bank premises and locking the outer glass door.	None
She testifies that she used to sell flowers at the junction of Thambu Chetty Street and Errabalu Chetty Street, not far from the Bank.	None
According to her, she was originally residing at Vyasarpadi but six months prior to the occurrence she shifted her residence to village Tharamani.	None
Her version is that every day she used to begin selling flowers in the day from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. and thereafter return to her house but on Thursdays and Fridays due to rush of customers she was constrained to remain late up to 9 p.m.	None
and since she could not get a bus at that hour, she used to sleep on the raised platform near the outer door of the Bank.	None
She knew the deceased Gnanasambandham who used to buy flowers from her, as well as the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty as they both used to come out of the Bank together at night.	None
The deceased would give the keys to the accused who would lock the outer glass door and thereafter pull down the shutters and lock the same and return the keys.	None
The deceased would then check the locks and thereafter both would leave the premises.	None
She distinctly remembered that on Friday prior to the incident the deceased while buying flowers enquired from her whether she used to sleep there and she had to explain that on Thursdays and Fridays she could not go back home due to late hours as there was no connecting bus.	None
That was the last when she saw the deceased aliveOn the night in question while she was sitting on the steps of the Bank after finishing her days work she saw the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty coming out of the Bank premises alone by opening the glass door, closing the same and proceeding towards Errabalu Chetty Street.	None
Her version is that he came back half an hour later with a light blue colour suitcase and again reentered the Bank by opening the glass door.	None
After about half an hour the accused came out of the Bank by opening the glass door with the suitcase in one hand, a bag on his shoulder and the briefcase which the deceased used to carry, in the other.	None
He kept the suitcase on the steps of the Bank where she was sitting and reentered the premises and brought out a large coffee colour skybag and kept the same beside the suitcase, locked the glass door, pulled down the shutters and locked the same.	None
She states that when the accused pulled down the shutters she asked him whether the Periya Ayya, evidently referring to the deceased, had not come, the accused did not give any reply.	None
Thinking that he had not understood her words properly, she repeated the same query to which there was no response.	None
After locking the shutters the accused went towards Errabalu Chetty Street leaving the suitcase and the skybag on the steps of the Bank.	None
It was a festival day and the deity of Kaliamman Koil was passing along Thambu Chetty Street.	None
PW 18 was feeling unwell and wanted to offer camphor to the deity but could not leave the place because the accused had left the suitcases on the steps.	None
The deity was taken in a procession throughout the street.	None
Thereafter, according to her, the accused came in an autorickshaw and with the help of the autorickshaw driver the accused carried and placed the suitcase and the skybag with some difficulty.	None
When she queried why had he left the suitcase when there were a large number of autorickshaws passing that way, the accused did not give any reply.	None
She further states that as she was running temperature she slept on the steps of the Bank.	None
Early next morning at 6 a.m. she left for her house at Tharamani and from there she went to her sisters place at Vyasarpadi after informing her husband.	None
She returned to Tharamani 45 days later feeling better when the police examined herWe have no doubt in our mind that PW 18 Smt.	None
Kanaka is a natural witness and there is a ring of truth in her version.	None
Though she was subjected to a searching and incisive crossexamination by learned counsel for the appellants, nothing was brought out to impeach her credibility as a truthful witness.	None
There was no reason for her to falsely implicate the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty particularly when the vital clue furnished by her led to the unravelling of the crime and recovery of the huge amount of money.	None
We are not impressed with the submission that merely because PW 18 was given a cash award of Rs. 5, 000/ by the Chief Minister she was a got up witness and must be regarded as a witness who springs from a tainted source.	None
It is not a phenomenon unknown in the world today for the Government to offer cash rewards to citizens for their act of courage and bravery by coming forward with vital information which results in the ultimate detection of the offender.	None
In such cases there is no question of impairing the testimonial fidelity of such person as a competent witness.	None
Learned counsel however draw our attention to the observation of this Court in Lingala Vijaykumar v. Public Prosecutor, Andhra Pradesh.	Arguments of Petitioner
1979 1	Arguments of Petitioner
SCR 2 where this Court viewed with concern the practice of offering cash rewards to prosecution witnesses when the case was subjudice.	Arguments of Petitioner
We may say at once that the Court it, that case did not discard the testimony of the prosecution witnesses on that account.	None
All it did in that case was to endorse the expression of opinion of the learned Sessions Judge that such rewards for bravery may be euphemistic officialese but are apt to be construed by the accused as purchase price for testimonial fidelity and the Government ought not to prejudge the case and award any cash reward to a citizen for his exemplary civic sense since he may figure as a material witness.	None
We need not say anything more.	None
The learned Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court were folly aware of this aspect and have scrutinised the testimony of PW 18 with meticulous care and we agree with them that merely because PW 18 was rewarded for her courage in coming forward to help the police her testimony should not be viewed with suspicion.	None
She withstood a close and searching crossexamination but her veracity as a truthful witnesses remains unshaken(3) Purchase of a suitcase and a skybag from Burma Bazar the testimony of PW 18 Smt.	None
Kanaka finds support from PW 19 Ramaswami, a dealer in suit cases in Burma Bazar.	None
This witness states that at about 9 or 9.15 p.m. on 20th May a faircomplexioned, tall and lean person aged about 2425 years, meaning the accused, came to his shop and purchased a light blue colour suitcase for a sum of Rs. 200/ which amount he paid in currency notes of the denomination of Rs. 20/ and also wanted one sky bag.

None
His version is supported by the entry in the trip sheet Exh. P41.	None
It is contended that the evidence of PWs 19 and 31 with regard to the identification of the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty before the Court of Session for the first time without any prior test identification parade was not of any value but we are not impressed.	None
Later both these witnesses saw the photograph of the accused carried by PW 50 Deviasigamani and identified him to be the person involved.	None
Such identification must take the place of a test identification.	None
Further, the evidence of PW 19 that the persons concerned purchased a coffee colour skybag along with a light blue colour suitcase stands corroborated by the subsequent recovery of the coffee colour skybag from PW 33 Smt.	None

The departure date is given as Bangalore on 22583It is somewhat strange that the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty who was merely a Clerk in the Bank should have gone and stayed in Hotel Chola Sheraton, a fivestar hotel, on the night in question unless it was for purposes of safety as he was carrying the huge amount of about Rs. 14 lakhs in the suitcase and the skybag.

5/ bearing the seal of the Bank from the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty on May 29, 1983 at 2 p.m. when he was arrested at My Ladys Park, and the remaining amount of Rs. 12, 27, 500/ in bundles of currency notes of the denominations of Rs. 100, 50, 20, 10 and 5 from appellant No. 2 Shivaram Shetty on the 30th opposite the Madras Central while he was on his way in a cyclerickshaw these recoveries have been proved by the Investigating Officer PW 50 Deviasigamani as well as the seizure witnesses PW 37 Neelakandan, PW 41 J. Kumar and one Sekar.	None
There is no reason to disbelieve their testimony particularly when it is an undisputed fact that the amount of Rs. 12, 32, 000/ belongs to the Karnataka Bank.	None
We thought that the cumulative effect of all these circumstances appearing was sufficient and conclusive to raise an inference of guilt.	None
According to learned counsel for the parties, however, the truth of the prosecution case, particularly recoveries at Madras, are rendered improbable for two reasons (i) the report in the Indian Express, Mangalore edition and the regional newspapers Malai Murasu and Makkal Kural on the 29th and Dina Thanthi on the 30th that both the accused had been taken into custody at Mangalore and the entire money stolen from the Bank recovered from the residence of appellant No. 2 Shivaram Shetty.	None
(ii) the admission of the prosecutions own witness PW 9 Govindaraj that the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty arrived at Madras by the West Coast Express on the 27th afternoon at 4 p.m. and was taken into custody by the police at the platform.	None
Undoubtedly, each of these circumstances by itself was sufficient to falsify the entire prosecution case as regards the alleged recoveries at Madras and therefore we heard learned counsel for the parties at considerable length but nothing really turns on them.	None
Learned counsel for the appellants with consummate skill tried to create, as he was entitled as counsel for the defence, to break the chain of circumstances and to show that there are various missing links in an effort that the Court may give the accused benefit of doubt.	Arguments of Petitioner
We are afraid, that is not a proper approach for the Court to adopt.	Reasoning
In the present case, the circumstances were closely linked up with one another and the Court would be misdirecting itself and commit a serious error of law if it were to separately deal with each circumstance, rejecting the circumstances one by one and then acquitting the accused on the ground that the incriminating circumstances brought out were not consistent with the guilt of the accused.	Reasoning
There can be no doubt whatever that the circumstances enumerated above has been cogently and firmly established by the prosecution which, taken cumulatively, form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty and none else.	Reasoning
As to the first, the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty was entitled to tender the newspaper report from the Indian Express of the 29th and the regional newspapers of the 30th along with his statement under S. 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	None
Both the accused at the stage of their defence in denial of the charge had summoned the editors of Tamil dailies Malai Murasu and Makkal Kural and the news reporters of the Indian Express and Dina Thanthi to prove the contents of the facts stated in the news item but they dispensed with their examination on the date fixed for the defence evidence.	None
We cannot take judicial notice of the facts stated in a news item being in the nature of hearsay secondary evidence, unless proved by evidence aliunde.	None
A report in a newspaper is only hearsay evidence.	None
A newspaper is not one of the documents referred to in S. 78(2) of the Evidence Act, 1872 by which an allegation of fact can be proved.	None
The presumption of genuineness attached under S. 81 of the Evidence Act to a newspaper report cannot be treated as proved of the facts reported therein.	None
It is now wellsettled that a statement of fact contained in a newspaper is merely hearsay and therefore inadmissible in evidence in the absence of the maker of the statement appearing in Court and deposing to have perceived the fact reported.	Reasoning
The accused should have therefore produced the persons in whose presence the seizure of the stolen money from appellant No. 2s house at Mangalore was effected or examined the press correspondents in proof of the truth of the contents of the news item.	Reasoning
The question as to the admissibility of newspaper reports has been dealt with by this Court in Samant N. Balakrishna v. George Fernandez, 1969 3 SCR 603 (AIR 1969 SC 1201 ).	Reasoning
There the question arose whether Shri George Fernandez, the successful candidate returned to Parliament from the Bombay South Parliamentary Constituency had delivered a speech at Shivaji Park attributed to him as reported in the Maratha, a widely circulated Marathi newspaper in Bombay, and it was said A newspaper report without any further proof of what had actually happened through witnesses is of no value.	Reasoning
It is at best a secondhand secondary evidence.	Reasoning
It is well known that reporters collect information and pass it on to the editor who edits the news item and then publishes it.	Reasoning
In this process the truth might get perverted or garbled.	Reasoning
Such news items cannot be said to prove themselves although they may be taken into account with other evidence if the other evidence is forcible.	Reasoning
We need not burden the judgment with many citations.	Reasoning
There is nothing on record to substantiate the facts as reported in the newspapers showing recovery of the stolen amount from the residence of appellant No. 2 at Mangalore.	Reasoning
We have therefore no reason to discard the testimony of PW 50 and the seizure witnesses which go to establish that the amount in question was actually recovered at Madras on the 29th and the 30th as alleged.	Reasoning
As to the second, much emphasis was laid on the statement made by PW 9 Govindaraj showing that the accused Laxmi Raj Shetty was taken into custody at the Railway Station on the 27th when he arrived by the West Coast Express.	Reasoning
It was submitted that the admission of the prosecutions own witness PW 9 about the arrest of the accused on the 27th was a serious infirmity which shows that the prosecution case about the alleged recoveries was concocted and untrue.	Reasoning
We have gone through the evidence of PW 9 with care.	Reasoning
It cannot be forgotten that this witness and the accused were appointed together as Probationary Clerks and obviously he is trying to help the accused.	Reasoning
We are satisfied that the Courts below were justified in not placing any credence on the statement made by this accused.	Reasoning
It is pertinent to mention that the alleged statement has been brought out during the crossexamination of this witness by learned counsel appearing for appellant No. 2.	Reasoning
It would certainly have been better for the Public Prosecutor to have the witness declared hostile with a view to crossexamine him and also called witnesses from the Bank to contradict him.	Reasoning
This was unfortunately not done but that would not have the effect of destroying the entire prosecution case having regard to the fact that the substantial portion of the stolen amount has been recovered from both the accused.	Reasoning
It is not disputed that the money recovered belongs to the Bank.	Reasoning
It is not suggested that such a large amount as Rs. 12, 32, 000/ bearing the seal of the Bank would have been planted on the accused.	Reasoning
In the premises, we are satisfied that the finding of guilt reached by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and the High Court after a proper and careful evaluation of the facts and circumstances appearing does not warrant any interference.	Reasoning
In the facts and circumstances of this particular case, we direct that the sentence of death passed on appellant No. 1	Decision
Laxmi Raj Shetty be commuted to one of imprisonment for life.	Decision
The evidence does not clearly indicate the exact manner in which the murder was committed.	Decision
It is noteworthy that appellant No. 1 had not taken with him any weapon for assaulting the deceased but used two stitchers lying in the Bank premises, indicating that the murder was not preplanned.	Decision
Looking to the nature of the weapon used, it seems to us that the accused acted under a momentary impulse.	Decision
In the circumstances, we direct that the death sentence passed on appellant No. 1 should be converted into one for life imprisonment.	Decision
Subject to this modification, the appeal fails and is dismissed.	Decision
The judgment and sentences passed on the appellants by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, as affirmed by the High Court in appeal, are upheld being appropriate.	Decision
The sentences passed on them shall run concurrently.	Decision
Appeal dismissed.	Decision
