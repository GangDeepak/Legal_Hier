The Subordinate Judge held that the amount of loan should be taken as the amount mentioned in the mtge deed of 1931 and not the amount advanced in 1893 and that a sum of Rs. 70,840 was still due on the bond.	Facts
He determined the marketvalue of the several properties given as security, adopting 16 times the net income as the basis.4.	Facts
Appeals to the H. C. were numbered as M. A. 108 to 111 of 1943 and they were heard by Manohar Lal and Imam JJ.	Facts
They modified the order of the lower Ct.	Facts
in certain respects.	Facts
Even according to them the amount of the loan was what was mentioned in the mtge bond of 6101931 but as a sum of Rs. 11,85530 had been repaid expressly towards the principal amount after the date of the bond that amount became reduced to Rs. 28,150.	Facts

They also directed that the valuation of the property should be fixed at twenty times the net income and not sixteen times.	Facts
It is from this order that the present appeals have been preferred.5.	Facts
Two points were urged on behalf of the applts.	Arguments of Petitioner
namely (a) that the decreeholder was barred by constuctiveres judicata from contending that the construction placed upon S. 7 by the judgmentdebtors was wrong and (b) that in applying S. 7, we must consider the original amount of loan of Rs. 40,000 given in the year 1893 and allow the claim of interest only for that maximum sum, after taking into account all sums paid by the applts.	Arguments of Petitioner
and their predecessors towards interest since 1893.6.	Arguments of Petitioner
The first point is entirely without substance.	Reasoning
When the decreeholder contended that S. 11, Bihar Moneylenders Act, 1938 was declared void and ultra vires and that there fore S. 7 of the new Act which corresponded to S. 11 was also inapplicable, the judgmentdebtors pleaded that they were entitled to the benefit of S. 7 of the new Act.	Reasoning
The F. C. held in Ramnandan Prasad v. Goshwami Madhwanand, 1940 F. C. R. 1 (A. I. R. (27)1940 F. C.1 )that the judgmentdebtors (present applts.) were entitled to claim the benefit of the provisions of the new Act when the executing Ct. proceeded under S. 13 to determine the value of the properties to be sold.	Reasoning
The correct interpretation of S. 7 was not in question between the parties.	Reasoning
To say that the applts.	Reasoning
were entitled to take advantage of the provisions of S. 7 is entirely different from the contention that the interpretation sought to be put by them on S. 7 was the right one.	Reasoning
The F. C. was not dealing with any question of interpretation at all.	Reasoning
It is impossible to see where the doctrine of constructiveres judicata comes in, so as to be of help to the applts.7.	None
The second question raised on their behalf relates to the true meaning of S. 7, Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transactions) Act, VII 7 of 1939, which is in these terms 7.	None
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or in anything having the force of law or in any agreement, no Court shall, in any suit brought by a moneylender before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act or in any appeal or proceedings in revision arising out of such suit, pass a decree for an amount of interest for the period preceding the institution of the suit, which together with any amount already realised as interest through the Court or otherwise, is greater than the amount of loan advanced, or, if the loan is based on a document, the amount of loan mentioned in, or evidenced by such document.8.	None
In the present case, the original loan of Rs. 40,000 was advanced as early as 1111893.	None
The applts.	None
contend that for the purposes of calculating the interest to be decreed prior to the date of the suit the loan advanced must be taken to be the original sum and that if an account is taken of all the sums received by the creditor as interest from that date up to the date of the suit, there would be nothing due for interest.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, the decreeholder urges that having regard to the latter part of the section, the loan must be taken to be the amount mentioned in the mtge.	Arguments of Respondent
bond dated 6101931, namely Rs. 42,000.	Arguments of Respondent
Whichever method of calculation is adopted, it must be remembered that it has to be made not for the purposes of passing any decree on the mtge.	Arguments of Respondent
loan, but for estimating under S. 13 of the Act, the value of the properties to be brought to sale in execution of the money decree against the applts.9.	Arguments of Respondent
As pointed out by Sir Maurice Gwyer C. J. in Surendra Prasad v. Gajadhar Prasad,1940 F. C. R. 39 (A I. R. (27) 1940 F. C.10), Section 7 of the Act of 1937 is no doubt extremely obscure and illdrawn.	None
The true intention of the framers of the Act is somewhat difficult to gather.	None
But the Patna H. C. has been consistently placing upon the section an interpretation which is opposed to the contention of the applts.	None
in these proceedings.10.	None
The point came up expressly for decision in Singeshwar Singh v. Medni Prasad, A.I.R. (27) 1940 Pat. 65 (1871.	None
C. 339), where a mtge.	None
bond was executed on 3181922 for a sum of Rs. 2,000 which was the balance of the principal and interest due under a mtge.	None
bond of the 11101912, for Rs. 1391.	None
The judgmentdebtors raised the plea that the Ct. should go back to the earlier bond of 1912 and that as a sum of Rs. 1512 had been paid as and by way of interest towards that bond, no decree could be passed against them for more than the principal sum of Rs.1391.	None
The learned Judges rejected this contention and took the amount stated in the document of 1922, namely Rs. 2,000 as the loan and they held that the plts.	None
were entitled to get a decree for interest for a sum not larger than Rs. 2,000 as no payment had been proved to have been made after the execution of the bond.	None
The same view was taken in Lal Singh v. Ramnarain Ram, A. I. R. (29) 1942 Pat. 138 at p. 139	None
(197 I. C. 659) and the pltfs.	None
were awarded a decree on the basis that the loan was to be taken as Rs.	None
2,90980 which was the amount for which the handnote sued upon was executed and not Rs. 1,000 which was the original amount advanced upon an earlier handnote of the year 1924.	None
The case reported in Madho Prasad v. Mukutdhari Singh,193 I. C. 661 (A. I. R. (28) 1941 Pat. 378) lays down the same position.	None
The F. B. decision in Deo Nandan Prasad v. Ram Prasad, 23 Pat. 618 (A. I. R. (31) 1944 Pat. 303 F. B.) reiterates the same view, pointing out the distinction between Ss. 7 and 8 of the Act and stating that while under S. 8 we can go to the original loan in spite of a later document, under S. 7 the loan must relate to the document on which the suit is based, that is, the final document and not the original one.	None
In each one of these cases, the question of the true meaning of S. 7 was pointedly considered.	Reasoning
This construction no doubt enables a creditor to circumvent the beneficent provisions of the Act by taking a document for the interest due and adding it to the principal amount.	Reasoning
Gwyer C. J., points out this difficulty at p. 59 in case Surendra Prasad v. Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate,1940 F. C. R. 39 (A. I. R. (27) 1940 F. C. 10).	Reasoning
If the interpretation does not carry out the intentions of the framers of the Act by reason of unhappy or ambiguous phrasing, it is for the Legislature to intervene.	Reasoning
But so far from doing so, it has acquiesced, during all these years, in the construction, which the Patna H. C. has been placing upon the section from the very next year after the enactment of the statute.	Reasoning
Having regard to the great obscurity in the language employed in the relevant provisions and the inaction of the Legislature, it is, in our opinion, legitimate to infer that the view expressed by the Patna H. C. is in accord with the intention of the Legislature.11.	Reasoning
The appeals fail and are dismissed with costs only one set in all of them together.12.	Decision
Appeals dismissed.	None
