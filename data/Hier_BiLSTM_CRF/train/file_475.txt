 Leave granted.	None
The present appeal arises out of the impugned judgement dated 09.12.2016 passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in FAO No. 168 of 2012.	Issue
By the said judgment, the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant seeking enhancement of the compensation already awarded by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bilaspur.	Issue
The appellants case in brief is that, on 02.04.2007 at around 1130 A.M., while the deceased Nand lal, a traffic constable, was doing his official duty was hit by a truck which was being driven in a negligent manner.	Facts
Although, he was rushed to the hospital immediately, but he then died at around 530 P.M on the same day.	Facts
The deceased was the sole bread earner of the family.	Facts
Aged 37 years, the deceased was drawing a salary of Rs. 13,064/ per month as per salary certificate produced on record, hence the annual income of the deceased was Rs.1,56,768/. The present appellant being the wife of the deceased preferred M.A.C. No. 70/2007 before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Bilaspur seeking compensation to the tune of Rs.40,00,000.	Facts
Vide order dated 15.09.2011, the tribunal awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.	Facts
17,83,640/ along with interest at the rate of Rs.7.5 per annum from the date of filling till the amount is deposited with the tribunal.	Facts
Aggrieved by the above compensation amount, the appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court in FAO No. 168/2012, seeking an enhancement to the tune of Rs. 25,00,000.	Facts
Vide order dated 09.12.2016, the High Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the earlier award granted by the Tribunal.	Facts
Hence, the present appeal.	Facts
The learned counsel for the appellant contended that, the High Court grossly erred while upholding the award passed by the Tribunal, as it did not calculate 50 of the salary as future prospects of the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, the High Court erred in upholding the earlier judgment passed by the tribunal as the multiplier was applied on the lower side contrary to the settled position of law.	Arguments of Petitioner
Whereas, the learned counsel for the respondent defended the impugned judgment contending that the High Court has plausibly dealt with the above raised contentions and thereafter considered the compensation amount to be justified.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence it did not disturb the earlier amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal.	Arguments of Respondent
We have heard learned counsel from both the sides and carefully perused the material on record.	Reasoning
It is evident on perusal of the award passed by the tribunal which was subsequently upheld by the High Court that both the courts have plainly ignored the future prospect of the deceased person, which is gross violation of the law laid down by this court in National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi and Ors.	Reasoning
(2017)16 SCC 680 .	Reasoning
The future prospects would necessarily mean advancement in future career, earnings and progression in one?s life.	Reasoning
The promotional avenues, career progression, grant of selection grades etc. are some of the features for considering one?s future prospects in one?s career.	Reasoning
On perusal of the facts, it is clear that the deceased who was a constable aged 37 years used to draw a salary of Rs.13,064/ per month.	Reasoning
Taking 50 of the annual salary for the future prospect, it results to Rs. 78,384/ and the total salary would aggregate up to Rs. 2,35,152/ (i.e., Rs.1,56,768 Rs.78,384).	Reasoning
Further, taking 1/4th of Rs.2,35,152 would result to be Rs. 58,788/.	None
Therefore, the annual loss of dependent would be around Rs.2,35,152Rs.58,788/ Rs.1,76,364/.	Reasoning
Further, this court in Sarla Verma (Smt.) and others v. Delhi Transport Corporation and Another, (2009) 6 SCC 121 , has held that if the age of the deceased is between 3640 years, then the multiplier applicable would be 15.	Reasoning
Keeping in view the aforesaid law laid down in the Sarla Verma?s case (Supra) since the deceased was 37 years, the appropriate multiplier will be 15.	Reasoning
Hence, the appellants are entitled to for a compensation to the tune of Rs. 26,45,460/.	Reasoning
Hence the amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal and upheld by the High Court, is enhanced from Rs.17,83,640 to Rs.26,45,460/ along with the interest 7.5 per annum.	Decision
The Respondent Insurance Company is directed to deposit the compensation awarded by this court before the Tribunal within 6 weeks, which shall thereafter be disbursed in favour of the legal representatives of the deceased on proper identification.	Decision
The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above.	Decision
There shall be no order as to costs.	Decision
