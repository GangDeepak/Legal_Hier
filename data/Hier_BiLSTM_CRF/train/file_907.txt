Arguments of Petitioner
It was further submitted that after taking into account the amount so intimated, the balance of Rs. 37,605 at best remains unexplained.	Arguments of Petitioner
But such amount being less than 10 of the total income, the appellant was entitled to the benefit in terms of decisions of this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. C. D. Singh, learned advocate appearing for the State supported the view taken by the court below.	Arguments of Respondent
Relying upon the decision of this court in N. Ramakrishnaiah (D) through LRs Vs. State of A.P. (2008 (17) SCC 83 ), it was submitted that the loans and gifts received by the petitioner would not constitute known sources of income as defined under Section 13(1) (e) of the Act.	None
The expression known sources of income in Section 13(1) (e) of the Act has two elements, first the income must be received from a lawful source and secondly the receipt of such income must have been intimated in accordance with the provisions of law, rules or orders for the time being applicable to the public servant.	Facts
In N. Ramakrishnaiah (Supra), while dealing with said expression, it was observed For the public servant, whatever return he gets of his service, will be the primary item of his income.	None
Other income which can conceivably be income qua the public servant will be in the regular receipt from (1) his property, or (b) his investment.	None
The categories so enumerated are illustrative.	None
Receipt by way of share in the partition of ancestral property or bequest under a will or advances from close relations would come within the expression known sources of income provided the second condition stands fulfilled that is to say, such receipts were duly intimated to the authorities as prescribed.	None
We have gone through Rules 14, 17 and 19 of the Rules.	None
Rule 14 lays down that a government servant on occasions such as weddings, anniversaries or religious functions may accept gifts up to certain limit, if he makes a report of such fact to the Government within a period of one month.	None
Sub Rules (4) and (5) provide inter alia, that in any other case, the government servant shall not accept any gift without the sanction of the Government and if the gift exceeds Rs. 2000, except through an account payee cheque.	None
Rule 17 deals with investment, lending and borrowing and provides inter alia that Government Servant may give to, or accept from a relation or a personal friend, a purely temporary loan.	None
Rule 19 lays down that the government servant must intimate the details of property inherited or acquired by the Govt.	None
Servant.	None
There is no absolute embargo or prohibition in the Rules and all that is required is sanction or permission from the Government.	None
In the instant case, every single amount received by the appellant has been proved on record through the testimony of the witnesses and is also supported by contemporaneous documents and intimations to the Government.	Reasoning
It is not the case that the receipts so projected were bogus or was part of a calculated device.	Reasoning
The fact that these amounts were actually received from the sources so named is not in dispute.	Reasoning
Furthermore, these amounts are well reflected in the Income Tax Returns filed by the appellant.	Reasoning
In similar circumstances, the acquisitions being reflected in Income Tax Returns weighed with this court in granting relief to the public servant.	Reasoning
In M. Krishana Reddy Vs.	Reasoning
State (1992(4) SCC 49).	Reasoning
It was observed in Para 14  Therefore, on the face of these unassailable documents i.e. the wealth tax and income tax returns, we hold that the appellant is entitled to have a deduction of Rs.56,240/ from the disproportionate assets of Rs.2,37,842/. Similarly in D.S.P Chennai Vs. K. Ibasagarain (2006 (1) SCC 420 ), the fact that the money was treated in the hands of the wife of the public servant and that she was assessed by the Income Tax Department was taken note of while accepting the explanation given by the public servant.13.	Reasoning
If the amounts in question, which were duly intimated and are reflected in the Income Tax Return are thus deducted, the alleged disproportionate assets stand reduced to Rs. 37,605, which is less than 10 of the income of the Appellant.	Reasoning
In Krishnanand Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (1977 (1) SCC 816 )and in M. Krishna Reddy (Supra), this court had granted benefit to the public servants in similar circumstances.	Reasoning
We respectfully follow said decisions.14.	Reasoning
In our view there is no violation of Section 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(2) of the Act.	Reasoning
We, therefore, set aside the judgment and order in appeal and acquit the appellant of the charges leveled against him.	Decision
The appeal thus succeeds and is allowed.	Decision
The appellant is already on bail.	Decision
The bail bonds shall stand discharged.	Decision
