Although the present appeals relate to the fixed deposit of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in the name of Biswanath, we may also set out them facts concerning the fixed deposit receipt in the name of Raghunath Prasad in so far as they are essential for appreciating the point of controversy.	Facts

Facts
At first it was taken to be a clean overdraft withou t any security, but on investigation the Income Tax authorities found that the overdraft facility had been granted to the respondent on the basis of the collateral security of the two fixed deposit receipts dated November 8, 1944 and November 21, 1944 issued by Jamnagar branch of the Bank in favour of Raghunath Prasad and Biswanath respectively.	Facts

Facts
5.	None
In the reference relating to question No. 1 about the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of Raghunath Prasad and Rs. 4, 50, 000 out of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in the name of Biswanath, the High Court held that there was material before the tribunal to hold that the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 sanding in the name of Raghunath Prasad was the concealed income of the respondent firm for the relevant previous year for the assessment year 194647.	Facts
The High Court in this connection took note of the fact that Raghunath Prasad died in August 1945 and after his death the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 was not paid to his heirs but was adjusted against the overdraft of the respondent firm.	Facts
As regards the other sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of Biswanath, the High Court held that there was no material before the Tribunal to hold that it was the concealed income of the respondent for the relevant previous year for the assessment year 194647.	Facts
The answer to the later part of question No .	Facts
I as well as to question No. 2 was thus given in favour of the respondent firm.	Facts
The respondent, it may be stated, filed an appeal in this Court to assail the finding of the High Court in answer to question No. 1 that there was material before the Tribunal to hold that the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of Raghunath Prasad was the concealed income of the respondent for the previous year in question.	Facts
The aforesaid appeal, No. CA 1035/67, was dismissed by this Court as per judgment dated January 18, 1971.	Facts
The present two appeals, as stated earlier, relate to the finding of the High Court that there was no material before the Tribunal to hold that the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of Biswanath was the concealed income of the respondent for the relevant previous year.6.	Facts
It may also be stated that in the reference which was made under section 66(i) of the Act by the Tribunal to the High Court, the High Court as per judgment dated April 1 , 1966, went into the question as to whether the income tax officer was justified in reopening the assessment under section 34 of the Act and whether on the facts and circumstances of the case, cash credits and fixed deposits in question were assessable for the assessment year 194647.	None
Both these questions were answered in favour of the department.	Facts
The decision of the High Court in this respect is reported in (1967)64 I.T.R. 593We have earlier mentioned that there was a third fixed deposit receipt of Rs 5, 00, 000 issued by the Central Bank Jamnagar branch in the name of S. P. Agarwal, son of Rameshwarlal, partner of the respondent firm.	Facts
This amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 had also been tendered in cash in the Burrabazar Calcutta branch of the Central Bank in October 1944 with instructions to remit the name to Jamnagar branch.	Facts
The fixed deposit in the name of S. P. Agarwal was used as a security for overdraft facility to Shri Hanuman Sugar Mills Ltd., in the managing agency of which the partners of the respondent firm had controlling interest.	Facts
The Tribunal held that the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of S. P. Agarwal did not represent the concealed income of the respondent firm.	Facts
An application was filed by the Commissioner of Income Tax to refer the question to the High Court as to whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the inference of the Tribunal that the fixed deposit of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in the name of S. P. Agarwal did not represent the concealed income of the assessee firm was justified in law.	Facts
The Tribunal rejected the application.	Facts
The Commissioner then applied to the High Court of Calcutta for an order calling upon the Tribunal to state a case and refer the above question to the High Court, The High Court rejected the application.	Facts
The Commissioner filed an appeal to this Court against the above order of the High Court.	Facts
The appeal of the Commissioner was dismissed by this Court on Mar ch 26, 1964.	Facts
The judgment of this Court is reported in (1964)53 I.T.R. 575.In the appeal before us the learned Additional Solicitor General has taken us through the various orders which were made in the case and has contended that there was relevant material before the Tribunal to hold that.	None
the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of Biswanath wag the concealed income of the respondent firm.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court, it is urged, was not justified in interfering with the finding in this respect of the Tribunal.	Arguments of Petitioner
As against that Mr. Sen on behalf of the respondent submits that there was no relevant material before the Tribunal to hold that the sum in question was the concealed income of the respondent.	Arguments of Respondent
the answers given by the High Court, according to the learned counsel, should therefore be sustained.7.	Arguments of Respondent
Before dealing with the facts of this case, we may advert to the principles which should govern the decisions of the court in such like cases.	None
Findings on questions of pure fact arrived at by the Tribunal are not to be disturbed by the High Court on a reference unless it appears that there was no evidence before the Tribunal upon which they, as reasonable men, could com e to the conclusion to which they have come and this is so, even though the High Court would on the evidence have come to a conclusion entirely different from that of the Tribunal.	None
In other words, such a finding can be reviewed only on the ground that there is no evidence to support it or that it is perverse.	None
Further, when a conclusion has been reached on an appreciation of a number of facts, whether that is sound or not must be determined, not by considering the weight to be attached to each single fact in isolation, but by assessing the cumulative effect of all the facts in their setting as a whole Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras(1957 31 T.T.R. 28.).When a court of fact acts on material partly relevant and partly irrelevant, it is impossible to say to what extent the mind of the court was affected by the irrelevant material used by it in arriving at its finding.	None
Such a finding is vitiated because of the use of inadmissible material and thereby an issue of law arises.	None
Likewise, if the court of fact bases its decision partly on conjectures, surmises and suspicions and partly on evidence, in such a situation an issue of law arises see Dhirajlal Girdharlal v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay(1954 26 I.T.R .	None
736.)	None
In the case of Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v. Bairstow and Another(1955 28 I.T.R. 579.), the House of Lords dealt with this aspect of the matter.	None
Viscount Simonds, in that case observedFor it is universally conceded that, though it is a pure finding of fact, it may be set aside on grounds which have been stated in various ways but are, I think, fairly summarised by saying that the court should take that course if it appears that the Commissioners have acted without any evidence or upon a view of the facts which could not reasonably be entertained.8.	None
Lord Radcliffee expressed himself in the following wordsIf the case contains anything ex facie which is bad law and which bears upon the determination, it is obviously erroneous in point of law.	None
But, without any such misconception appearing ex facie, it may be that the facts found are such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal.	None
In those circumstances, too, the court must intervene.9.	None
The above observations were relied upon by Bhagwati J. ( speaking for the majority) in the case of Mehta Parikh Co. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay((1956) 30 I.T.R. 181).	None
The following proposition was laid down in that caseIt follows, therefore, that facts proved or admitted may provide evidence to support further conclusions to be deduced from them, which conclusions may themselves be conclusions of fact and such inferences from facts proved or admitted could be matters of law.	None
The Court would be entitled to intervene if it appears that the fact finding authority has acted without any evidence or upon a view of the facts, which could not reasonably be entertained or the facts found are such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law would have come to the determination in question.10.	None
Keeping the principles enunciated above in view, let us examine the facts of the present case.	None
The Tribunal in arriving at the conclusion that the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of Biswanath was the concealed income of the respondent firm based its decision on the following circumstances(1) Explanation furnished by Biswanath with regard to the source of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in proceedings relating to his personal assessment was found to be incorrect.(2) The transfer of the two amounts of Rs. 5, 00, 000 each from Calcutta to Bombay and thereafter to Jamnagar and the issue of fixed deposit receipts by t he Bank in the name of the sons of the partners of the respondent firm.(3)	Facts
The use of the above mentioned two receipts as collateral security for the overdraft facility of Rs. 10, 00, 000 afforded to the respondent firm.11.	None
The High Court took the view that the above material was not sufficient for holding that the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 belonged to the respondent firm and that the Tribunal had taken into consideration material which was not relevant to the issue.	None
We have given the matter our consideration and are of the opinion that no case has been made for interfering with the judgment of the High Court.	None
The explanation furnished about the source of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name of Biswanath was that he had kept an amount of Rs. 4, 50, 000 with M s Soorajmal Nagarmal and Rs. 50, 000 in deposit with Comilla Bank.	None
The amount of Rs. 4, 50, 000 was stated to have been withdrawn by Biswanath from M s Soorajmal Nagarmal in January 1941, while the other amount of Rs. 50, 000 was withdrawn from Comilla Bank in March 1942.	None
The amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 was then transferred by Biswanath to his native place Ratangarh (Desh) in Rajasthan due to bombing panic in Calcutta.	None
When war situation improved, the money was taken from Desh to Jamnagar for deposit.	None
This explanation was found to be false in viewof the admitted position that the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in fixed deposit in the name.	None
of Biswanath in Jamnagar bank had been tendered at Burrabazar Calcutta branch of Central Bank on November.	None
.15.	None
1944 and thereafter was transferred through Bombay head office of.	None
the Bank, to Jamnagar.	None
There were also, .	None
other circumstances which pointed to falsity of the above explanation.	None
The falsity the above explanation of Biswanath, in the opinion of the High Court. did not warrant the conclusion that the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 lakhs belonged to the assessee.	None
We can find no flaw or infirmity in the above reasoning of the High Court.	None
The question which arose for determination in this case was not whether the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 belonged to Biswanath, but whether it belonged to the respondent firm.	None
The fact that Biswanath has not been able to give a satisfactory explanation regarding the source of Rs. 5, 00, 000 would not be decisive, even of the matter as to whether Biswanath was or was not the owner of that amount.	None
A person can still be held to be the owner of a sum of money even though the explanation furnished by him regarding the source of that money is found to be not correct.	None
From the simple fact that the explanation regarding the source of money furnished by A, in whose name the money is lying in deposit, has been found to be false, it would be a remote and far fetched conclusion to hold that the money belongs to B. There would be in such a case no direct nexus between the facts found and the conclusion drawn there fromWe also see no cogent ground to take a view different from that of the High Court that the other circumstances, namely, the transfer of the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 from Calcutta to Jamnagar for fixed deposit in the name of Biswanath and the use soon thereafter of the said fixed deposit receipt as security for the overdraft facility to the respondent firm did not justify the inference that the amount belonged to the respondent.	None
The material on record indicates that the facility of overdraft on the security of the fixed deposit receipt in the name of Biswanath was enjoyed by the assessee firm for a little over a year.	None
The Tribunal in this context observed that it is difficult to see how the firm could obtain an overdraft upon a fixed deposit by B. N. Gupta (Biswanath).	None
The, approach of the Tribunal in this respect, in our opinion was manifestly erroneous because it is a common feature of commercial and other transactions that securities are offered by other persons to guarantee the payment of the amount which may be found due from the principal debtor.	None
The. concept of security and ownership are different and it would be a wholly erroneous approach to hold that a thing offered in security by a third person to guarantee the payment of debt due from the principal debtor belongs not to the surety but to the principal debtor the Tribunal has, also referred to the fact that no consideration passed to Biswanath for offering the fixed deposit receipt as security for the overdraft facility to the respondent firm.	None
This circumstance, in our opinion, is of a natural character and has n o material bearing for determining the ownership of the amount in fixed deposit.	None
Sureties quite often offer security without receipt of consideration from the principal debtor.	None
So far as the present case is concerned, we cannot be oblivious of the fact that Biswanath offered security for the overdraft facility to a firm of which his father was a partner.	None
In the circumstances, the, fact that Biswanath received no consideration for offering the fixed deposit receipt a s security for the overdraft facility would not result in any inference against the respondent.	None
Although the proceedings under section 34 of the Act in the present case were started in 1955, after the lapse of about nine years since the time Biswanath had offered the fixed deposit receipt as security for the overdraft facility to the respondent firm, no material was brought on the record to show that the aforesaid sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 in the name of Biswanath went to the coffers of the respondent firm or was adjusted towards its liability as was done in respect of the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 which had been deposited in the name of Raghunath Prasad.	None
Had the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000 deposited in the name of Biswanath been ultimately utilised by the respondent firm, the income tax authorities must have brought material on record about that.12.	None
The onus to prove that the apparent is not the real is on the party who claims it to be so.	Reasoning
As it was the department which claimed that the amount of fixed deposit receipt belonged to the respondent firm even though the receipt had been issued in the name of Biswanath, the burden lay on the department to prove that the respondent was the owner of the amount despite the fact that the receipt was in the name of Biswanath.	Reasoning
A simple way of discharging the onus and resolving the controversy was to trace the source and origin of the amount and find out its ultimate destination.	Reasoning
So far as the source is concerned, there is no material on the record to show that the amount came from the coffers of the respondent firm or that it was tendered in Burrabazar Calcutta branch of the Central Bank on November 15, 1944 on behalf of the respondent.	Reasoning
As regards the destination of the amount, it has already been mentioned that there is nothing to show that it went to the coffers of the respondent.	Reasoning
On the contrary, there is positive evidence that the amount was received by Biswanath on January 22, 1946.	Reasoning
It would thus follow that both as regards the source as well as the destination of the amount.	Reasoning
the material on the record gives no support to the. claim of the department.	Reasoning
Learned Additional Solicitor General has urged that the close proximity of time between the transfer of the amount of Rs. 5, 00, 000 from Calcutta for the issue of fixed deposit receipt in the name of Biswanath at Jamnagar and the opening of overdraft account of respondent firm in Calcutta with the said fixed deposit receipt constituting security f or the overdraft account would show that the said amount in fact belonged to the respondent.	Reasoning
We find it difficult to accede to this submission because the benefit received by the respondent by the use of the said receipt as a collateral security for overdraft facility was only of a temporary nature.	Reasoning
The receipt remained in the name of Biswanath and it was he who got the amount of the receipt on January 22, 1946.13.	None
Reference was also made by the Additional Solicitor General to the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.	None
It is stated that the said order is much more elaborate and the Tribunal has made note of this fact.	Reasoning
In this respect we find that the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner is vitiated by two factual inaccuracies.	Reasoning
According to the said order, the amount of the fixed deposit receipt in the name of Biswanath was received in Calcutta on November 25, 1946 and was transferred to the credit of the respondent firm against the overdraft with the Bank.	Reasoning
This observation was incorrect because there is ample material on record to show that the amount of the fixed deposit receipt was received, as mentioned earlier, on January 22, 1946 by Biswanath himself.	Reasoning
He also, it would app ear, got the interest due on the said amount.14.	None
The other factual inaccuracy which crept into the order of the, Appellate Assistant Commissioner was his assumption that the shares of the two groups of Nopanys and Bhuwalkas were equal.	Reasoning
It was observed by the Appellate Assistant CommissionerThe appellant firm itself consists of two groups of partners Nopany and Bhuwalka.	Reasoning
Each group had equal shares.	Reasoning
Raghunath Prasad belongs to the Nopany group and Biswanath to the Bhuwalka group.	Reasoning
The amount offered for fixed deposits therefore corresponds to the profit sharing proportion of each group.	Reasoning
This mass of evidence and circumstances could not be upset merely because the fixed deposits stood in two particular names.15.	None
The above factual assumption regarding the equality of shares of the two groups was incorrect because it is the common case of the parties that the share of Bhuwalka group was 10 annas in a rupee and that of Nopany was 6 annas in a rupee.16.	None
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner also took into account the fact that the office of the Central Bank in Burrabazar Calcutta is in the same building in which there are the business premises of the respondent firm.	None
This was, in our opinion, a wholly extraneous and irrelevant circumstance for determining the ownership of Rs. 5, 00, 000 which had been deposited in fixed deposit in the name of Biswanath.	Reasoning
There should, in our opinion, be some direct nexus between the conclusion of fact arrived at by the authority concerned and the primary facts upon which that conclusion is based.	Reasoning
The use of extraneous and irrelevant material in arriving at that conclusion would vitiate the conclusion of fact because it is difficult to predicate as to what extent the extraneous and irrelevant material has influenced the authority in Arriving at the conclusion of fact.17.	Reasoning
No case, in our opinion, has been made for interfering with the judgment of the High Court.	Decision
The appeals consequently fail and are dismissed with costs.	Decision
On hearing fee.18.	Decision
Appeals dismissed.	None
