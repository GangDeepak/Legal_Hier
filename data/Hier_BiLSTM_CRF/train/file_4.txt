 F. Nariman, J. Civil Appeal No.323 of 2021 In 2009, Corporate Power Ltd.	None
the corporate debtor set up a thermal power project in Jharkhand, and for so doing, availed of loan facilities from various lenders, including the State Bank of India SBI.	Facts
The account of the corporate debtor was declared as a nonperforming asset by SBI on 31.07.2013.	Issue
On 27.03.2015, SBI issued a loanrecall notice to the corporate debtor in its capacity as the lenders agent.	Issue
On 31.03.2015, some of the original lenders of the corporate debtor, namely, India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited, SBI, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Patiala, and State Bank of Travancore assigned the debts owed to them by the corporate debtor to the appellant, the Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited.	Facts
On 20.06.2015, the appellant issued a notice under Section 13(2) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 SARFAESI Act on behalf of itself and other consortium lenders to the corporate debtor.	Facts
On 01.06.2016, the appellant took actual physical possession of the project assets of the corporate debtor under the SARFAESI Act.	Facts
On 26.12.2018, the appellant filed an application under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 IBC before the National Company Law Tribunal, Calcutta NCLT for a default amounting to Rs.5997,80,02,973/ from the corporate debtor.	Facts
As the relevant form indicating the date of default did not indicate any such date, this was made up by the appellant on 08.11.2019 by filing a supplementary affidavit before the NCLT, specifically mentioning the date of default and annexing copies of balance sheets of the corporate debtor, which, according to the appellant, acknowledged periodically the debt that was due.	Facts
On 19.02.2020, the Section 7 application was admitted by the NCLT, observing that the balance sheets of the corporate debtor, wherein it acknowledged its liability, were signed before the expiry of three years from the date of default, and entries in such balance sheets being acknowledgements of the debt due for the purposes of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 Limitation Act, the Section 7 application is not barred by limitation.	Facts
In an appeal filed to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal NCLAT, the corporate debtor relied upon the Full Bench judgment of the NCLAT in V. Padmakumar v. Stressed Assets Stabilisation Fund, Company Appeal (AT) (Insolvency) No. 57 of 2020 (decided on 12.03.2020) V. Padmakumar, in which a majority of four members Justice (Retd.)	Facts
A.I.S. Cheema, Member (Judicial), dissenting held that entries in balance sheets would not amount to acknowledgement of debt for the purpose of extending limitation under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Facts
After a preliminary hearing, a threeMember Bench passed an order on 25.09.2020 doubting the correctness of the majority judgment of the Full Bench and referred the matter to the Acting Chairman of the NCLAT to constitute a Bench of coordinate strength to reconsider the judgment in V. Padmakumar (supra).	Facts
A fiveMember Bench of the NCLAT, vide the impugned judgment dated 22.12.2020, refused to adjudicate the question referred, stating that the reference to the Bench was itself incompetent.	Facts
Shri Ramji Srinivasan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, has assailed the impugned judgment, arguing that the majority judgment of the Full Bench of the NCLAT in V. Padmakumar (supra) was clearly per incuriam as it has not considered various binding judgments of this Court and that the said judgment was wholly incorrect in rejecting the reference out of hand at a preliminary stage.	Arguments of Petitioner
For this purpose, he referred to a number of judgments of this Court in which it has been made clear that vide Section 238A of the IBC, Section 18 of the Limitation Act is applicable to a proceeding under Section 7 of the IBC.	Arguments of Petitioner
Also, according to the learned Senior Advocate, the judgments of the High Courts and the judgments of this Court have expressly held that entries made in signed balance sheets of the corporate debtor would amount to acknowledgements of liability and have, therefore, correctly been relied upon by the NCLT on the facts of this case.	Arguments of Petitioner
He argued, relying upon certain judgments, that the reference made to the fiveMember Bench by the three Member Bench was perfectly in order and ought to have been answered on merits.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also argued that the constitution of the fiveMember Bench which passed the impugned judgment was not in order as three out of the five members of the said Bench were members who assented with the majority opinion in V. Padmakumar (supra), the dissentient member not being made part of the Bench so formed.	Arguments of Petitioner
This, according to him, was contrary to the principles of natural justice.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also argued that the fact that a balance sheet has to be filed under compulsion of law does not mean that an acknowledgement of debt has also to be made under compulsion of law, and for this purpose, he referred to two High Court judgments.	Arguments of Petitioner
4.	Arguments of Petitioner
Refuting the aforesaid submissions, Shri Abhijeet Sinha, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the Respondents, argued that the Explanation to Section 7, read with the definition of default contained in Section 3(12) of the IBC, would preclude the application of Section 18 of the Limitation Act inasmuch as a default in respect of a financial debt would include a financial debt owed not only to the applicantfinancial creditor, but to all other financial creditors of the corporate debtor.	Arguments of Respondent
He then referred to the rationale for enacting Section 238A by referring to the Insolvency Committee Report which introduced the aforesaid Section and strongly relied upon the fact that in all these cases, recovery proceedings were ongoing before the Debt Recovery Tribunal and or the appellate authority under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 Recovery of Debts Act and that, by not applying Section 18 of the Limitation Act to the IBC, recoveries will not be thwarted.	Arguments of Respondent
He also added that the main plank of the submission of the appellant was that a huge sum of Rs.12,000 crore would otherwise go down the drain if acknowledgements in balance sheets were not to be looked at, and stressed the fact that this would be relevant only in recovery proceedings and not in proceedings before the IBC, which are not meant to be recovery proceedings at all, as has been held in several judgments of this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
He then relied upon two High Court judgments, from the Andhra Pradesh High Court and Gauhati High Court, to buttress his submission that via Section 18 of the Limitation Act, entries made in balance sheets do not amount to acknowledgement of debt.	Arguments of Respondent
He also stressed the fact that no date of default has been mentioned in the original form that was submitted with the Section 7 application, and that this would, therefore, be a noncurable defect, on account of which the Section 7 application should have been dismissed at the threshold.	Arguments of Respondent
He then took us to various judgments of this Court which made it clear that if a period of three years had elapsed from the date of declaration of the account of a corporate debtor as a non performing asset, the claim filed by a creditor is a dead claim which cannot be resurrected having recourse to Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Finally, he argued that the balance sheets in the present case did not amount to acknowledgement of liability inasmuch as the auditors report, which must be read along with the balance sheets, would make it clear that there was no unequivocal acknowledgement of debt, but that caveats had been entered by way of notes in the auditors report.	Arguments of Respondent
After hearing counsel for both sides, it is important to first advert to the rationale for the enactment of Section 238A of the IBC, which was enacted by way of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 w.e.f. 06.06.2018.	None
Section 238A of IBC reads as follows 238A. Limitation.	None
The provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 (36 of 1963) shall, as far as may be, apply to the proceedings or appeals before the Adjudicating Authority, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, the Debt Recovery Tribunal or the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be.	None
In Jignesh Shah v. Union of India, (2019) 10 SCC 750, this Court referred to the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of March, 2018, which led to the introduction of Section 238A, as follows In para 7 of the said judgment B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Parag Gupta and Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633 , the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of March 2018 was referred to as follows (B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Parag Gupta and Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633 , SCC pp.	None
64445, para 11)	None
Having heard the learned counsel for both sides, it is important to first set out the reason for the introduction of Section 238A into the Code.	None
This is to be found in the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of March 2018, as follows Application of Limitation Act, 1963 28.1.	None
The question of applicability of the Limitation Act, 1963 (the Limitation Act) to the Code has been deliberated upon in several judgments of NCLT and NCLAT.	None
The existing jurisprudence on this subject indicates that if a law is a complete code, then an express or necessary exclusion of the Limitation Act should be respected.	None
Ravula Subba Rao v. CIT, AIR 1956 SC 604 In light of the confusion in this regard, the Committee deliberated on the issue and unanimously agreed that the intent of the Code could not have been to give a new lease of life to debts which are time barred.	None
It is settled law that when a debt is barred by time, the right to a remedy is timebarred.	None
Punjab National Bank v. Surendra Prasad Sinha, 1993 Supp (1) SCC 499 1993 SCC (Cri) 149	None
This requires being read with the definition of debt and claim in the Code.	None
Further, debts in windingup proceedings cannot be timebarred Interactive Media and Communication Solution (P) Ltd. v. GO Airlines Ltd., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 445 (2013) 199 DLT 267 , and there appears to be no rationale to exclude the extension of this principle of law to the Code.	None
28.2.	None
Further, nonapplication of the law on limitation creates the following problems first, it re opens the right of financial and operational creditors holding timebarred debts under the Limitation Act to file for CIRP, the trigger for which is default on a debt above INR one lakh.	None
The purpose of the law of limitation is to prevent disturbance or deprivation of what may have been acquired in equity and justice by long enjoyment or what may have been lost by a partys own inaction, negligence or laches Rajender Singh v. Santa Singh, (1973) 2 SCC 705 .	None
Though the Code is not a debt recovery law, the trigger being default in payment of debt renders the exclusion of the law of limitation counter intuitive.	None
Second, it reopens the right of claimants (pursuant to issuance of a public notice) to file time barred claims with the IRP RP, which may potentially be a part of the resolution plan.	None
Such a resolution plan restructuring timebarred debts and claims may not be in compliance with the existing laws for the time being in force as per Section 30(4) of the Code.	None
28.3.	None
Given that the intent was not to package the Code as a fresh opportunity for creditors and claimants who did not exercise their remedy under existing laws within the prescribed limitation period, the Committee thought it fit to insert a specific section applying the Limitation Act to the Code.	None
The relevant entry under the Limitation Act may be on a casetocase basis.	None
It was further noted that the Limitation Act may not apply to applications of corporate applicants, as these are initiated by the applicant for its own debts for the purpose of CIRP and are not in the form of a creditors remedy.	None
(emphasis in original)	None
A perusal of the above would show that considering that the Limitation Act applies only to courts, unless made statutorily applicable to tribunals, the Committee was of the view that such Act should be made to apply to the IBC as well, observing that though the IBC is not a debt recovery law, the trigger being default in payment of debt would render the exclusion of the law of limitation counterintuitive.	Reasoning
Thus, it was made clear that an application to the IBC should not amount to resurrection of timebarred debts which, in any other forum, would have been dismissed on the ground of limitation.	Reasoning
From the above, it is clear that the principle of Section 9 of the Limitation Act is to be strictly adhered to, namely, that when time begins to run, it cannot be halted, except by a process known to law.	Reasoning
One question that arises before this Court is whether Section 18 of the Limitation Act, which extends the period of limitation depending upon an acknowledgement of debt made in writing and signed by the corporate debtor, is also applicable under Section 238A, given the expression as far as may be governing the applicability of the Limitation Act to the IBC.	Reasoning
The aforesaid question is no longer res integra as two recent judgments of this Court have applied the provisions of Section 14 and Section 18 of the Limitation Act to the IBC.	Reasoning
Thus, in Sesh Nath Singh v. Baidyabati Sheoraphuli Cooperative Bank Ltd., Civil Appeal No. 9198 of 2019 (decided on 22.03.2021), after setting out the issues that arose in that case in paragraph 57, and after referring to Section 238A of IBC, held Similarly under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, an acknowledgement of present subsisting liability, made in writing in respect of any right claimed by the opposite party and signed by the party against whom the right is claimed, has the effect of commencing of a fresh period of limitation, from the date on which the acknowledgement is signed.	None
However, the acknowledgement must be made before the period of limitation expires.	Reasoning
As observed above, Section 238A of the IBC makes the provisions of the Limitation Act, as far as may be, applicable to proceedings before the NCLT and the NCLAT.	Reasoning
The IBC does not exclude the application of Section 6 or 14 or 18 or any other provision of the Limitation Act to proceedings under the IBC in the NCLT NCLAT.	Reasoning
All the provisions of the Limitation Act are applicable to proceedings in the NCLT NCLAT, to the extent feasible.	Reasoning
We see no reason why Section 14 or 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 should not apply to proceeding under Section 7 or Section 9 of the IBC.	Reasoning
Of course, Section 18 of the Limitation Act is not attracted in this case, since the impugned order of the NCLAT does not proceed on the basis of any acknowledgement.	Reasoning
Nearer home, in Laxmi Pat Surana v. Union Bank of India, Civil Appeal No. 2734 of 2020, a judgment delivered on 26.03.2021, this Court, after referring to various judgments of this Court, including the judgment in Babulal Vardharji Gurjar v. Veer Gurjar Aluminium Industries (P) Ltd., (2020) 15 SCC 1 Babulal, then held The purport of such observation has been dealt with in the case of Babulal Vardharji Gurjar (II)	None
Babulal Vardharji Gurjar v. Veer Gurjar Aluminium Industries (P) Ltd., (2020) 15 SCC 1 .	None
Suffice it to observe that this Court had not ruled out the application of Section 18 of the Limitation Act to the proceedings under the Code, if the fact situation of the case so warrants.	None
Considering that the purport of Section 238A of the Code, as enacted, is clarificatory in nature and being a procedural law had been given retrospective effect which included application of the provisions of the Limitation Act on casetocase basis.	None
Indeed, the purport of amendment in the Code was not to reopen or revive the time barred debts under the Limitation Act.	None
At the same time, accrual of fresh period of limitation in terms of Section 18 of the Limitation Act is on its own under that Act.	None
It will not be a case of giving new lease to time barred debts under the existing law (Limitation Act) as such.	None
Notably, the provisions of Limitation Act have been made applicable to the proceedings under the Code, as far as may be applicable.	None
For, Section 238A predicates that the provisions of Limitation Act shall, as far as may be, apply to the proceedings or appeals before the Adjudicating Authority, the NCLAT, the DRT or the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal, as the case may be.	None
After enactment of Section 238A of the Code on 06.06.2018, validity whereof has been upheld by this Court, it is not open to contend that the limitation for filing application under Section 7 of the Code would be limited to Article 137 of the Limitation Act and extension of prescribed period in certain cases could be only under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.	None
There is no reason to exclude the effect of Section 18 of the Limitation Act to the proceedings initiated under the Code.	None
Section 18 of the Limitation Act reads thus Effect of acknowledgement in writing.(1) Where, before the expiration of the prescribed period for a suit or application in respect of any property or right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of such property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such property or right is claimed, or by any person through whom he derives his title or liability, a fresh period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the acknowledgement was so signed.	Reasoning
Where the writing containing the acknowledgement is undated, oral evidence may be given of the time when it was signed but subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), oral evidence of its contents shall not be received.	None
Explanation.	None
For the purposes of this section, (a) an acknowledgement may be sufficient though it omits to specify the exact nature of the property or right, or avers that the time for payment, delivery, performance or enjoyment has not yet come or is accompanied by a refusal to pay, deliver, perform or permit to enjoy, or is coupled with a claim to set off, or is addressed to a person other than a person entitled to the property or right (b) the word signed means signed either personally or by an agent duly authorised in this behalf and (c) an application for the execution of a decree or order shall not be deemed to be an application in respect of any property or right.	None
Ordinarily, upon declaration of the loan account debt as NPA that date can be reckoned as the date of default to enable the financial creditor to initiate action under Section 7 of the Code.	None
However, Section 7 comes into play when the corporate debtor commits default.	None
Section 7, consciously uses the expression default  not the date of notifying the loan account of the corporate person as NPA.	None
Further, the expression default has been defined in Section 3(12) to mean non payment of debt when whole or any part or instalment of the amount of debt has become due and payable and is not paid by the debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case may be.	None
In cases where the corporate person had offered guarantee in respect of loan transaction, the right of the financial creditor to initiate action against such entity being a corporate debtor (corporate guarantor), would get triggered the moment the principal borrower commits default due to nonpayment of debt.	None
Thus, when the principal borrower and or the (corporate) guarantor admit and acknowledge their liability after declaration of NPA but before the expiration of three years therefrom including the fresh period of limitation due to (successive) acknowledgements, it is not possible to extricate them from the renewed limitation accruing due to the effect of Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	None
Section 18 of the Limitation Act gets attracted the moment acknowledgement in writing signed by the party against whom such right to initiate resolution process under Section 7 of the Code enures.	None
Section 18 of the Limitation Act would come into play every time when the principal borrower and or the corporate guarantor (corporate debtor), as the case may be, acknowledge their liability to pay the debt.	None
Such acknowledgement, however, must be before the expiration of the prescribed period of limitation including the fresh period of limitation due to acknowledgement of the debt, from time to time, for institution of the proceedings under Section 7 of the Code.	None
Further, the acknowledgement must be of a liability in respect of which the financial creditor can initiate action under Section 7 of the Code.	None
Given the aforesaid, it is not possible to accede to the arguments made by Shri Sinha that Section 18 of the Limitation Act cannot be made applicable by reason of the arguments put forth by him.	Reasoning
As has been held in Ambika Prasad Mishra v. State of U.P., (1980) 3 SCC 719, every argumentative novelty does not undo a settled position of law.	Reasoning
Krishna Iyer, J., speaking for a Bench of five learned Judges, stated thus	Reasoning
But, after listening to the Marathon erudition from eminent counsel, a 13Judge Bench of this Court upheld the vires of Article 31A in unequivocal terms.	Reasoning
That decision binds, on the simple score of stare decisis and the constitutional ground of Article 141.	Reasoning
Every new discovery or argumentative novelty cannot undo or compel reconsideration of a binding precedent.	Reasoning
In this view, other submissions sparkling with creative ingenuity and presented with high pressure advocacy, cannot persuade us to reopen what was laid down for the guidance of the nation as a solemn proposition by the epic Fundamental Rights case (1973) 4 SCC 225 1973 Supp SCR 1.	Reasoning

SCR 671 (1976) and after Article 31A has stood judicial scrutiny although, as stated earlier, we do not base the conclusion on Article 31A.	Reasoning
Even so, it is fundamental that the nations Constitution is not kept in constant uncertainty by judicial review every season because it paralyses, by perennial suspense, all legislative and administrative action on vital issues deterred by the brooding threat of forensic blow up.	Reasoning
This, if permitted, may well be a kind of judicial destabilisation of State action too dangerous to be indulged in save where national crisis of great moment to the life, liberty and safety of this country and its millions are at stake, or the basic direction of the nation itself is in peril of a shakeup.	Reasoning
It is surely wrong to prove Justice Roberts of the United States Supreme Court right when he said Smith v. Allwright, 321 US 649, 669, 670 (1944)	Reasoning
The reason for my concern is that the instant decision, overruling that announced about nine years ago, tends to bring adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket good for this day and train only.	None
It is regrettable that in an era marked by doubt and confusion, an era whose greatest need is steadfastness of thought and purpose, this Court which has been looked to as exhibiting consistency in adjudication, and a steadiness which would hold the balance even in the face of temporary ebbs and flows of opinion, should now itself become the breeder of fresh doubt and confusion in the public mind as to the stability of our institutions.	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied) Section 18 of the Limitation Act reads as follows Effect of acknowledgement in writing.(1) Where, before the expiration of the prescribed period for a suit or application in respect of any property or right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of such property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such property or right is claimed, or by any person through whom he derives his title or liability, a fresh period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the acknowledgement was so signed.	Reasoning
Where the writing containing the acknowledgement is undated, oral evidence may be given of the time when it was signed but subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), oral evidence of its contents shall not be received.	None
Explanation.	None
For the purposes of this section, (a) an acknowledgement may be sufficient though it omits to specify the exact nature of the property or right, or avers that the time for payment, delivery, performance or enjoyment has not yet come or is accompanied by refusal to pay, deliver, perform or permit to enjoy, or is coupled with a claim to set off, or is addressed to a person other than a person entitled to the property or right, (b) the word signed means signed either personally or by an agent duly authorised in this behalf, and (c) an application for the execution of a decree or order shall not be deemed to be an application in respect of any property or right.	None
In an illuminating discussion on the reach of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, including the reach of the Explanation to the said Section, this Court, in Khan Bahadur Shapoor Fredoom Mazda v. Durga Prasad, (1962) 1	Reasoning
SCR 140 Shapoor Fredoom Mazda, after referring to Section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1908, which corresponds to Section 18 of the 1963 Act, held It is thus clear that acknowledgement as prescribed by Section 19 merely renews debt it does not create a new right of action.	Reasoning
It is a mere acknowledgement of the liability in respect of the right in question it need not be accompanied by a promise to pay either expressly or even by implication.	Reasoning
The statement on which a plea of acknowledgement is based must relate to a present subsisting liability though the exact nature or the specific character of the said liability may not be indicated in words.	Reasoning
Words used in the acknowledgement must, however, indicate the existence of jural relationship between the parties such as that of debtor and creditor, and it must appear that the statement is made with the intention to admit such jural relationship.	Reasoning
Such intention can be inferred by implication from the nature of the admission, and need not be expressed in words.	Reasoning
If the statement is fairly clear then the intention to admit jural relationship may be implied from it.	Reasoning
The admission in question need not be express but must be made in circumstances and in words from which the court can reasonably infer that the person making the admission intended to refer to a subsisting liability as at the date of the statement.	Reasoning
In construing words used in the statements made in writing on which a plea of acknowledgement rests oral evidence has been expressly excluded but surrounding circumstances can always be considered.	Reasoning
Stated generally courts lean in favour of a liberal construction of such statements though it does not mean that where no admission is made one should be inferred, or where a statement was made clearly without intending to admit the existence of jural relationship such intention could be fastened on the maker of the statement by an involved or farfetched process of reasoning.	Reasoning
Broadly stated that is the effect of the relevant provisions contained in Section 19, and there is really no substantial difference between the parties as to the true legal position in this matter.	Reasoning
(at pages 144145)	None
The next question that this Court must address is as to whether an entry made in a balance sheet of a corporate debtor would amount to an acknowledgement of liability under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Issue
Several judgments of this Court have indicated that an entry made in the books of accounts, including the balance sheet, can amount to an acknowledgement of liability within the meaning of Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	None
Thus, in Mahabir Cold Storage v. CIT, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 402, this Court held The entries in the books of accounts of the appellant would amount to an acknowledgement of the liability to M s Prayagchand Hanumanmal within the meaning of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 and extend the period of limitation for the discharge of the liability as debt.	Reasoning
Likewise, in a case concerning the dishonour of a cheque under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, this Court, in A.V. Murthy v. B.S. Nagabasavanna, (2002) 2 SCC 642 A.V. Murthy, held It is also pertinent to note that under subsection (3) of Section 25 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by his agent generally or specially authorized in that behalf, to pay wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation of suits, is a valid contract.	Reasoning
Moreover, in the instant case, the appellant has submitted before us that the respondent, in his balance sheet prepared for every year subsequent to the loan advanced by the appellant, had shown the amount as deposits from friends.	Reasoning
A copy of the balance sheet as on 3131997 is also produced before us.	Reasoning
If the amount borrowed by the respondent is shown in the balance sheet, it may amount to acknowledgement and the creditor might have a fresh period of limitation from the date on which the acknowledgement was made.	Reasoning
However, we do not express any final opinion on all these aspects, as these are matters to be agitated before the Magistrate by way of defence of the respondent.	Reasoning
The judgment in A.V. Murthy (supra) was followed in S. Natarajan vs. Sama Dharman, Crl. A. No. 1524 of 2014 (decided on 15.07.2014) as follows In this connection, we may usefully refer to a judgment of this Court in A.V. Murthy v. B.S.	Reasoning
Nagabasavanna A.V. Murthy v. B.S. Nagabasavanna, (2002) 2 SCC 642 where the accused had alleged that the cheque issued by him in favour of the complainant in respect of sum advanced to the accused by the complainant four years ago was dishonoured by the bank for the reasons account closed.	Reasoning
The Magistrate had issued summons to the accused.	Reasoning
The Sessions Court quashed the proceedings on the ground that the alleged debt was barred by limitation at the time of issuance of cheque and, therefore, there was no legally enforceable debt or liability against the accused under the Explanation to Section 138 of the NI Act and, therefore, the complaint was not maintainable.	Reasoning
While dealing with the challenge to this order, this Court observed that Under Section 118 of the NI Act, there is a presumption that until the contrary is proved, every negotiable instrument was drawn for consideration.	Reasoning
This Court further observed that Section 139 of the NI Act specifically notes that it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 of the NI Act for discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability.	Reasoning
This Court further observed that under Subsection (3) of Section 25 of the Contract Act, a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by his agent generally or specially authorized in that behalf, to pay wholly or in part a debt of which the creditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation of suits, is a valid contract.	Reasoning
Referring to the facts before it, this Court observed that the complainant therein had submitted his balance sheet, prepared for every year subsequent to the loan advanced by the complainant and had shown the amount as deposits from friends.	Reasoning
This Court noticed that the relevant balance sheet is also produced in the Court.	Reasoning
This Court observed that if the amount borrowed by the accused therein is shown in the balance sheet, it may amount to acknowledgement and the creditor might have a fresh period of limitation from the date on which the acknowledgement was made.	Reasoning
An exhaustive judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Bengal Silk Mills Co. v. Ismail Golam Hossain Ariff, 1961 SCC OnLine Cal 128 AIR 1962 Cal 115 Bengal Silk Mills held that an acknowledgement of liability that is made in a balance sheet can amount to an acknowledgement of debt as follows In support of the contention that the balancesheets do not amount to acknowledgements of liability, because they were prepared under compulsion of law Mr. Banerji relies upon the decision in Kashinath v. New Akot Ginning and Pressing Co. Ltd., I.L.R. 1950 Nag.	Reasoning
562 at 568 A.I.R. 1951 Nag. 255.	Reasoning
It is true that the balancesheets were required to be made both by the Indian Companies Act, 1913 as also by the articles of association of the defendant company.	Reasoning
There was a compulsion upon the managing agents to prepare the documents but there was no compulsion upon them to make any particular admission.	Reasoning
They faithfully discharged their duty and in doing so they made honest admissions of the Companys liabilities.	Reasoning
Those admissions, though made in discharge of their duty, are nevertheless conscious and voluntary admissions.	Reasoning
A document is not taken out of the purview of section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act merely on the ground that it is made under compulsion of law, see Venkata v. Partha Saradhi, 1892 I.L.R. 16 Mad. 220 at 222, Udaya Thevar v. Subrahmania Chetti, (1896) 6 M.L.J. 266, 269, Good v. Jane Job, 120 E.R. 810 at 812.	Reasoning
I am unable to agree with the reasoning of the Nagpur decision that a balancesheet does not save limitation because it is drawn up under a duty to set out the claims made on the company and not with the intention of acknowledging liability.	Reasoning
The balancesheet contains admissions of liability the agent of the company who makes and signs it intends to make those admissions.	Reasoning
The admissions do not cease to be acknowledgements of liability merely on the ground that they were made in discharge of a statutory duty.	Reasoning
I notice that in the Nagpur case the balancesheet had been signed by a director and had not been passed either by the Board of Directors or by the company at its annual general meeting and it seems that the actual decision may be distinguished on the ground that the balancesheet was not made or signed by a duly authorized agent of the company.	Reasoning
Mr. Banerji next contends that none of the balancesheets contains an admission of liability subsisting on the date of which it is made.	Reasoning
According to him the balancesheet for the year ended 30111936 which was made on 161937 contains an admission of past liability as on 30111936 but not an admission of liability existing on 161937.	Reasoning
Mr. Banerji contends that such an admission does not satisfy the test of an acknowledgement under section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act.	Reasoning
His contention is supported by Jwala Prasad v. Jwala Bank Ltd., A.I.R. 1957 All.	Reasoning
143 at 145.	Reasoning
In that case the Allahabad High Court held that the balancesheet did not contain any acknowledgement of an existing liability and therefore could not be treated as an acknowledgement under section 19.	Reasoning
Mr. Banerji also relied upon the decisions in Kandasami Reddi v. Suppammal, I.L.R. 45 Mad. 443 , Venkata v. Partha Saradhi, I.L.R. 18 Mad. 220, Rustomji on Limitation, 6th Edition, pages 191193 and the cases collected therein.	Reasoning
Now it is well settled that in order to satisfy the test of an acknowledgement under section 19 the admission of liability must be an admission of subsisting liability.	Reasoning
In Kandasami Reddi v. Suppammal, I.L.R. 45 Mad. 443 at 445, Ayling J. said, Liability can only signify present liability at the time of acknowledgement and this is clearly laid down in Venkata v. Parthasaradhi, (1893) 16 Mad. 220.	Reasoning
In Venkata v. Parthasaradhi, I.L.R. 16 Mad. 220 at 223 Muttasami Ayyar, J. said, It is therefore necessary that upon a reasonable construction of the language used by the debtor in writing the relation of debtor and creditor must appear to be distinctly admitted, that it must be admitted also to be a subsisting jural relation, and then an intention to continue it until it is lawfully determined must also be evident.	Reasoning
The section requires a definite admission of liability in respect of the debt, but even an admission that the debt existed at a previous date may, having regard to the language used and the surrounding circumstances, amount to an implied representation that the debt is still subsisting (see Maniram Seth v. Seth Rupchand, I.L.R. 33 Cal. 1047 P.C.).	Reasoning
In my opinion the balancesheets satisfy the test of an acknowledgement under section 19.	Reasoning
Each of them contains an admission that balances have been struck at the end of the previous year and that a definite sum has been found to be the balance then due to the creditor.	Reasoning
The natural inference to be drawn from the balancesheet is that the closing balance due to the creditor at the end of the previous year will be carried forward as the opening balance due to him at the beginning of the next year.	Reasoning
In each balancesheet there is thus an admission of a subsisting liability to continue the relation of debtor and creditor and a definite representation of a present intention to keep the liability alive until it is lawfully determined by payment or otherwise.	Reasoning
There is necessarily a time lag between the date of the signing of the balancesheet and the end of the previous year.	Reasoning
The balancesheet contains no admission of the amount due on the date of the signature, that amount may be and often is different from the amount shown as due at the end of the previous year, but that fact alone does not take the document out of the purview of section Take the case of a banker and its depositor.	Reasoning
Suppose the banker sends to the depositor a monthly statement of account made for the month of February 1961 and signed on March 15, 1961.	Reasoning
The statement gives the balance due on February 28, 1961.	Reasoning
The amount due on March 15 may be quite different the banker might have been made payments for the customer, nevertheless the statement amounts to a sufficient acknowledgement under section 19.	Reasoning
I am therefore unable to agree with the decision in Jwala Prasad v. Jwala Bank Ltd., A.I.R. 1957 All.	Reasoning
144.	None
To come under section 19 an acknowledgement of a debt need not be made to the creditor nor need it amount to a promise to pay the debt.	Reasoning
In England it has been held that a balancesheet of a company stating the amount of its indebtedness to the creditor is a sufficient acknowledgement in respect of a specialty debt under section 5 of the Civil Procedure Act, 1833 (3 and 4 Will 4c.	Reasoning

c. 97), see Re The Coliseum (Burrow) Ltd., (1930) 2 Ch. 44 at 47 and under sections 23 and 24 of the Limitation Act, 1939 (c. 21), see Ledingham v. Bermejo Estancia Co. Ltd., (1947) 1 A.E.R. 749 and Jones v. Bellgrove Properties Ltd., (1949) 2 K.B. 700, on appeal from (1949) 1 A.E.R. 498.	Reasoning
Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Act, 1833 did not require that the acknowledgement should be given to the claiming creditor and consequently a balancesheet containing an admission of indebtedness to the debenture holders was a sufficient acknowledgement of liability in respect of the debentures under that section, though it was sent only to the debenture holders who happened to be the shareholders of the company and not to the other debenture holders, see Re Atlantic and Pacific Fibre Importing and Manufacturing Co. Ltd., (1928)	Reasoning
1	Reasoning
Ch. 836.	Reasoning
Under Tentendens Act, 1828 as also under the Limitation Act, 1939 (c. 21) the acknowledgement must be made to the creditor or his agent and if the balance sheet is sent to a shareholder who is also a creditor the requirements of those Acts were satisfied, see Re The Coliseum (Burrow) Ltd., (1930) 2 Ch. 44 at 47, Jones v. Bellgrove Properties Ltd., (1949) 1 A.E.R. 498 at 504 affirmed (1949) 2 K.B. 700.	Reasoning
The decision in the last case has been followed in India and it has been held that an admission of indebtedness in a balancesheet is a sufficient acknowledgement under section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act, see Raja of Vizianagram v.

Importantly, this judgment holds that though the filing of a balance sheet is by compulsion of law, the acknowledgement of a debt is not necessarily so.	Arguments of Petitioner
In fact, it is not uncommon to have an entry in a balance sheet with notes annexed to or forming part of such balance sheet, or in the auditors report, which must be read along with the balance sheet, indicating that such entry would not amount to an acknowledgement of debt for reasons given in the said note.	Reasoning
Bengal Silk Mills (supra) also dealt with the judgment in Kashinath Sankarappa v. New Akot Cotton Ginning Pressing Co. Ltd., 1949 SCC OnLine MP 123 AIR 1951 Nag 255 Kashinath by distinguishing the said judgment on the ground that the balance sheet in that case was not made or signed by a duly authorised agent of the company.	Reasoning
Quite apart from this, if the said judgment is perused, what becomes clear is that the observation made in paragraph 20 is really an obiter observation, as the High Court went on to hold in paragraph 26 that the balance sheets that were produced were never proved in accordance with law, apart from being validly rejected by the shareholders, as a result of which, such balance sheets could not, therefore, operate as acknowledgements of liability under Section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1908.	Reasoning
In an appeal to the Supreme Court in Kashinath Sankarappa Wani v. New Akot Cotton Ginning and Pressing Co. Ltd., 1958 SCR 1331 , this Court referred to Section 3(b) of the Commercial Documents Evidence Act (XXX of 1939) and then held that under the said Act, the balance sheet of the respondent company for the year 19401941 should have been admitted in evidence.	None
This Court held that, unfortunately, the provisions of the said Act had not been brought to the attention of the High Court.	None
However, having so held, this Court then went on to hold that on the facts of that case, no presumption that the balance sheet was duly made under Section 3(b) could be raised, as a result of which there could be no acknowledgement of liability on the facts of that case.	None
Two other judgments of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the Gauhati High Court were also relied upon by the counsel for the respondents.	Reasoning
So far as the Andhra Pradesh High Court is concerned, in Vijayalakshmi v. Hari Hara Ginning and Pressing, Nandigaon, OS A No. 40 of 1998 (decided on 03.03.1999), Liberhan, C.J. differed from a Karnataka High Court judgment which stated that showing of an amount in a balance sheet would amount to an acknowledgement under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Reasoning
This was done as follows The learned Counsel for the appellant relied on a decision of the Karnataka High Court in State Bank of India v. Hegde and Golay Ltd., 1985 SCC OnLine Kar 428 ILR 1987 Kar 2673, wherein it is observed that showing of an amount in a balance sheet amounts to an acknowledgement in terms of the Indian Limitation Act.	Reasoning
Consequently, the amount having been admitted and the respondent having not paid the same, the petition required admission as laid down by the said judgment that civil suit as well as legal proceedings can continue simultaneously.	Reasoning
Without expressing our opinion on the law laid down in the said judgment, though it cannot be categorically laid down that mere showing a debt due in a balancesheet would amount to acknowledgement, we may observe that it is a wellestablished law that for giving an acknowledgement, a person has to be conscious of his act to the knowledge of the other person.	Reasoning
Merely showing a debt in a balancesheet cannot, prima facie, as presently advised, be termed to be an acknowledgement in terms of the Indian Limitation Act.	Reasoning
The acknowledgement as envisaged by the Limitation Act categorically had to be with the intention of accepting the debt with the object of extending the limitation for recovery, which is not the case herein.	Reasoning
Thus, we do not find the case in hand to be covered by the law laid down by the said judgment though we have our own doubts with respect to correctness of the law laid down in the said judgment.	Reasoning
This judgment does not, in any manner, even purport to lay down the law.	Reasoning
That apart, the statement that an acknowledgement, as envisaged by the Limitation Act, has to be with the intention of accepting the debt with the object of extending the limitation for recovery is de hors Section 18 of the Limitation Act and directly contrary to Shapoor Fredoom Mazda (supra) which is, in fact, referred to in the very next paragraph of the aforesaid judgment.	Reasoning
Shapoor Fredoom Mazda (supra) had made it plain that all that was necessary was that the acknowledgement establishes a jural relationship of debtor and creditor, which undoubtedly was established on the facts of that case.	Reasoning
This judgment, therefore, cannot avail the respondents.	Reasoning
Reliance was also placed on a judgment of the Gauhati High Court in Ajit Chandra Bagchi v. Harishpur Tea Company (P.) Ltd., 1990 SCC OnLine Gau 24 AIR 1991 Gau 92.	Reasoning
In particular, paragraphs 9 and 10 were relied upon by learned counsel for the respondents.	Reasoning
These paragraphs state I may now turn to the next submission of learned counsel for the appellants  defendants that the plaintiff failed to prove that the amounts in question were due from the defendants.	Reasoning
The contention of the counsel is that the plaintiff simply produced before the court certain books of account and balance sheets.	Reasoning
No effort was made even to prove the individual entries in the said books of account.	Reasoning
The claim was sought to be established by the plaintiff simply on the basis of the balance appearing in the books of account of plaintiff itself as outstanding against the Tea Estates of the defendants.	Reasoning
It was submitted that the books of account or the balance sheets showing the amount due from the defendants are not sufficient without other evidence to prove the debt.	Reasoning
The learned counsel in this connection relied on section 34 of the Evidence Act, which provides that even entries in the books of account regularly kept in the course of business, which are relevant, are alone not sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability.	Reasoning
Learned counsel also relied on the Illustration given to the said section, which is as follows A sues B for Rs. 1000, and shows entries in his accountbooks showing B to be indebted to him to this amount.	Reasoning
The entries are relevant, but are not sufficient without other evidence to prove the debt.	Reasoning
On the basis of the aforesaid provision it was submitted that the entries in the books of account showing the defendants to be indebted to the plaintiff for certain amount might be relevant but are not sufficient to prove the debt.	Reasoning
In the instant case, the learned counsel submitted, even the entries have not been proved.	Reasoning
What is sought to be proved is the balance appearing in the accounts or in the balance sheet as due from the defendants.	Reasoning
Such a course is not permissible except in a case of accounts stated.	Reasoning
Admittedly, the present case is not one of accounts stated.	Reasoning
I have carefully considered the submissions.	Reasoning
I find that neither the individual entries have been proved by the plaintiff nor there is any material whatsoever other than the books of account or the balance sheet to prove that the transactions in question in fact took place.	Reasoning
No decree can therefore, be obtained by the plaintiff merely on the basis of certain entries in the account books or the balance shown to be due at the end of the year in such accounts or in the balance sheets.	Reasoning
The admitted position in the instant case is that no evidence has been adduced by the plaintiff to prove the transactions which had been categorically denied by the defendants in their written statement.	Reasoning
In that view of the matter even on facts it has to be held that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the amount claimed in the suit was due from the defendants.	Reasoning
In view of the aforesaid finding, I am of the opinion that the learned trial court was not justified in decreeing the suit.	Reasoning
The suit was barred by limitation except in so far as it relates to recovery of a sum of Rs.	Reasoning
30/.	Reasoning
Besides, the plaintiff also failed to prove the debt in accordance with law.	Reasoning
Under the circumstances, the suit should have been dismissed.	Reasoning
This judgment also does not take the case of the respondents any further as, like the Nagpur High Court judgment in Kashinath (supra), the entries in the books of accounts were not proved on the facts of that case.	Reasoning
We must now examine the position under the Companies Act, 2013 Companies Act qua any compulsion of law for filing of balance sheets and acknowledgements made therein.	None

A perusal of the aforesaid Sections would show that there is no doubt that the filing of a balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act is mandatory, any transgression of the same being punishable by law.	Reasoning
However, what is of importance is that notes that are annexed to or forming part of such financial statements are expressly recognised by Section 134(7).	Reasoning
Equally, the auditors report may also enter caveats with regard to acknowledgements made in the books of accounts including the balance sheet.	Reasoning
A perusal of the aforesaid would show that the statement of law contained in Bengal Silk Mills (supra), that there is a compulsion in law to prepare a balance sheet but no compulsion to make any particular admission, is correct in law as it would depend on the facts of each case as to whether an entry made in a balance sheet qua any particular creditor is unequivocal or has been entered into with caveats, which then has to be examined on a case by case basis to establish whether an acknowledgement of liability has, in fact, been made, thereby extending limitation under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Reasoning
The judgment in Bengal Silk Mills (supra) has been referred to with approval in various other judgments.	Reasoning
Thus, in South Asia Industries (P) Ltd. v. General Krishna Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana, 1972 SCC OnLine Del 185 ILR (1972) 2 Del 712, the Delhi High Court held Shri Rameshwar Dial argued that statements in the balancesheet of a company cannot amount to acknowledgement of liability because the balancesheet is made under compulsion of the provisions in the Companies Act.	Reasoning
There is no force in this argument.	Reasoning
In the first place, section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963, requires only that the acknowledgement of liability must have been made in writing, but it does not prescribe that the writing should be in any particular kind of document.	Reasoning
So, the fact that the writing is contained in a balancesheet is immaterial.	Reasoning
In the second place, it is true that section 131 of the Companies Act, 1913 (section 210 of the Companies Act, 1956) makes it compulsory that an annual balance sheet should be prepared and placed before the Company by the Directors, and section 132 (section 211 of the Companies Act, 1956) requires that the balancesheet should contain a summary, inter alia, of the current liabilities of the company.	Reasoning
But, as pointed out by Bachawat J. in Bengal Silk Mills v. Ismail Golam Hossain Ariff, A.I.R. 1962 Calcutta 115 although there was statutory compulsion to prepare the annual balancesheet, there was no compulsion to make any particular admission, and a document is not taken out of the purview of section 18 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 (section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908) merely on the ground that it is prepared under compulsion of law or in discharge of statutory duty.

Punjab 341, in which statements in balance sheets of companies were held to amount to acknowledgements of liability of the companies.	Reasoning
Shri Rameshwar Dial referred to the decision of the Privy Council in Consolidated Agencies Ltd. v. Bertram Ltd., (1964) 3 All.	Reasoning
E.R. 282.	Reasoning
We shall advert to this decision presently when we deal with another argument of Shri Rameshwar Dial, and it is sufficient to state so far as the argument under consideration is concerned that even in this decision of the Privy Council it has been recognised that balancesheets could in certain circumstances amount to acknowledgements of liability.	Reasoning
It cannot, therefore, be said as a general proposition of law that statements in balancesheets of a company cannot operate at all as acknowledgements of liability as contended by Shri Rameshwar Dial.	Reasoning
The learned counsel next argued that the words used in the entry in the balancesheet in the present case did not amount to any acknowledgement of liability.	Reasoning
We do not think so.	Reasoning
The words used in the entry apparently show that in explaining its current liabilities and the provisions made for the same, it was stated that there was a sum of Rs. 7,87,150.42 held in share holders suspense account for payment to the shareholders of the Indian National Airways Limited (in voluntary liquidation since dissolved).	Reasoning
The words used clearly acknowledge the liability.	Reasoning
The learned single Judge also took the same view as regards the words used in the balancesheet.	Reasoning
In Lahore Enamelling and Stamping Co. Ltd. v. A.K. Bhalla, Tek Chand J. held that debts due to creditors not mentioned by name but included in the item relating to Loans (unsecured) or as due to Sundry Creditors mentioned in the balancesheet amount to an acknowledgement of liability for the purposes of section 19 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908.	Reasoning
There was thus no force in the argument of the learned counsel.	Reasoning
xxx	None
xxx xxx	None
The next argument was that the balancesheet was no doubt signed by two Directors, but they did not sign as duly authorised agents of the transferee company as required by explanation (b) to section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Reasoning
There is no substance in this argument.	Reasoning
The Companies Act, 1956, came into force in 1956.	Reasoning
Section 210 of the Act requires the Board of Directors to lay a balancesheet before the company at the Annual General Meeting.	Reasoning
Section 211 prescribes the form and contents of a balancesheet.	Reasoning
The form of balancesheet is given in Part 1 of Schedule VI to the Act, and according to it the current liabilities and provisions have to be set out in the balancesheet.	Reasoning
Section 215(i)(ii) requires that the balancesheet should be signed on behalf of the Board of Directors, inter alia, by the Secretary of the Company and by not less than two Directors of the company.	Reasoning
Section 215(3) provides that a balancesheet shall be approved by the Board of Directors before it is signed on behalf of the Board of Directors in accordance with section 215(i)(ii) and before it is submitted to the Auditors for their report thereon.	Reasoning
Thus, the statement of current liabilities and provisions in the balancesheet has to be approved by the Board of Directors before it is signed by the Secretary and two Directors on behalf of the Board.	Reasoning
In other words, the balancesheet is signed by the Secretary and two Directors at the instance and on the approval of the Board of Directors of the company.	Reasoning
After the balancesheet is audited, section 216 requires that the Auditors report should be attached to the balancesheet, and section 217 requires the Board of Directors also to make a report.	Reasoning
The balancesheet together with the Auditors report and the Boards report are then required to be placed before the company at the annual general meeting for adoption of the balancesheet.	Reasoning
After the balance sheet has been so laid before the company at the annual general meeting, section 220 requires that three copies of the balancesheet should be filed with the Registrar.	Reasoning
In the present case, the balancesheet (Schedule D to Annexure J) was signed by the Secretary and two Directors, and Annexure J contains the Auditors report and the Boards report.	Reasoning
It was stated in the judgment of the learned single Judge that the balancesheet was adopted by the company and the same was not disputed before us.	Reasoning
It is thus quite clear that the balance sheet was signed by duly authorised agents of the company.	Reasoning
The judgment of Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. (as His Lordship then was), sitting singly in the Calcutta High Court, has, in Pandam Tea Co. Ltd., In re, 1973 SCC OnLine Cal 93 AIR 1974 Cal 170, held as follows Now the question is whether the statements, which are contained in the profits and loss accounts and the assets and liabilities side indicating the liability of the petitioning creditor along with the statement of the Directors made to the shareholders as Directors report should be read together and if so whether reading these two statements together these amount to an acknowledgement as contemplated under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963, or Section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1908.	None
In my opinion, both these statements have to be read together.	None
The balancesheet is meant to be presented and passed by the shareholders and is generally accompanied by the Directors report to the shareholders.	None
Therefore in understanding the balancesheets and in explaining the statements in the balancesheets, the balancesheets together with the Directors report must be taken together to find out the true meaning and purport of the statements.	None
Counsel appearing for petitioning creditor contended that under the statute the balancesheet was a separate document and as such if there was unequivocal acknowledgement on the balancesheet the statement of the Directors report should not be taken into consideration.	None
It is true the balancesheet is a statutory document and perhaps is a separate document but the balancesheet not confirmed or passed by the shareholders cannot be accepted as correct.	None
Therefore, in order to validate the balancesheet, it must be duly passed by the shareholders at the appropriate meeting and in order to do so it must be accompanied by a report, if any, made by the Directors.	None
Therefore, even though the balancesheet may be a separate document these two documents in the facts and circumstances of the case should be read together and should be construed together.	None
It was held by the Supreme Court in the case of L.C. Mills v. Aluminium Corpn. of India Ltd., (1971) 1 SCC 67 AIR 1971 SC 1482 , that it was clear that the statement on which the plea of acknowledgement was founded should relate to a subsisting liability as the section required and it should be made before the expiration of the period prescribed under the Act.	None
It need not, however, amount to a promise to pay for an acknowledgement did not create a new right of action but merely extended the period of limitation.	None
The statement need not indicate the exact nature or the specific character of the liability.	None
The words used in the statement in question must, however, relate to a present subsisting liability and indicate the existence of a jural relationship between the parties such as, for instance, that of a debtor and a creditor and the intention to admit such jural relationship.	None
Such an intention need not, however, be in express terms and could be inferred by implication from the nature of the admission and the surrounding circumstances.	Reasoning
Generally speaking, a liberal construction of the statement in question should be given.	None
That of course did not mean that where a statement was made without intending to admit the existence of jural relationship, such intention should be fastened on the person making the statement by an involved and farfetched reasoning.	None
In order to find out the intention of the document by which acknowledgement was to be construed the document as a whole must be read and the intention of the parties must be found out from the total effect of the document read as a whole.	None
In Hegde Golay Limited v. State Bank of India, 1985 SCC OnLine Kar 428 ILR 1987 Kar 2673, the Karnataka High Court held as follows Re. Point (e).	None
The acknowledgement of liability contained in the balancesheet of a company furnishes a fresh starting point of limitation.	None
It is not necessary, as the law stands in India, that the acknowledgement should be addressed and communicated to the creditor.	None
We are in respectful agreement with the view taken by the Learned Company Judge on the point.	None
The position of law that an acknowledgement of debts in the balancesheets of a Company does furnish fresh starting point of limitation is too well settled to need any elaborate discussion (See Jones v. Bellgrove Properties Ltd. 1949 (1) All ER 498, In Re Campania de Electricidad 1980	None

None
Certainly a time barred debt cannot be the basis of a winding up petition.	None
However, admission of a debt either in a balance sheet or in the form of a letter duly signed by the respondent, would amount to an acknowledgement, extending the period of limitation.	None
Section 18(1) of the Limitation Act, 1963 incorporates the said principle.	None
Section 18(1) of the Limitation Act, 1963 reads as under Effect of acknowledgement in writing.	Reasoning
Where, before the expiration of the prescribed period for a suit or application in respect of any property or right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of such property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such property or right is claimed, or by any person through whom he derives his title or liability, a fresh period of limitation shall be computed from the time when the acknowledgement was so signed.

In CITIII v. Shri Vardhman Overseas Ltd., 2011 SCC OnLine Del 5599 (2012) 343 ITR 408 , the Delhi High Court held In the case before us, as rightly pointed out by the Tribunal, the assessee has not transferred the said amount from the creditors account to its profit and loss account.	Reasoning
The liability was shown in the balance sheet as on 31st March, 2002.	Reasoning
The assessee being a limited company, this amounted to acknowledging the debts in favour of the creditors.	Reasoning
Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963 provides for effect of acknowledgement in writing.	Reasoning
It says where before the expiration of the prescribed period for a suit in respect of any property or right, an acknowledgement of liability in respect of such property or right has been made in writing signed by the party against whom such property or right is claimed, a fresh period of limitation shall commence from the time when the acknowledgement was so signed.	Reasoning
In an early case, in England, in Jones v. Bellgrove Properties, (1949) 2KB 700, it was held that a statement in a balance sheet of a company presented to a creditorshare holder of the company and duly signed by the directors constitutes an acknowledgement of the debt.	Reasoning
In Mahabir Cold Storage v. CIT (1991) 188 ITR 91 1991 Supp (1) SCC 402, the Supreme Court held The entries in the books of accounts of the appellant would amount to an acknowledgement of the liability to Messrs. Prayagchand Hanumanmal within the meaning of Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and extend the period of limitation for the discharge of the liability as debt.	Reasoning
In several judgments of this Court, this legal position has been accepted.	Reasoning

In Ambika Mills Ltd.	Reasoning
Ahmedabad v. CIT Gujarat (1964) 54 ITR 167 , it was further held that a debt shown in a balance sheet of a company amounts to an acknowledgement for the purpose of Section 19 of the Limitation Act and in order to be so, the balance sheet in which such acknowledgement is made need not be addressed to the creditors.	Reasoning
In light of these authorities, it must be held that in the present case, the disclosure by the assessee company in its balance sheet as on 31st March, 2002 of the accounts of the sundry creditors amounts to an acknowledgement of the debts in their favour for the purposes of Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Reasoning
The assessees liability to the creditors, thus, subsisted and did not cease nor was it remitted by the creditors.	Reasoning
The liability was enforceable in a court of law.	Reasoning
In Shahi Exports Pvt. Ltd. v. CMD Buildtech Pvt. Ltd., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 2535 (2013) 202 DLT 735, the Delhi High Court held It is hardly necessary to cite authorities in support of the wellestablished position that an entry made in the companys balance sheet amounts to an acknowledgement of the debt and has the effect of extending the period of limitation under section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963.	Reasoning
However, I may refer to only one decision of the learned single judge of this Court (Manmohan, J.) in Bhajan Singh Samra v. Wimpy International Ltd. 185 (2011) DLT 428 for the simple reason that it collects all the relevant authorities on the issue, including some of the judgments cited before me on behalf of the petitioners.

Indeed, the entry admits such liability towards JSPL for the amount claimed, and no explanation that may be provided, or circumstance surrounding the entry, can alter the fact of that liability.	None

Sethumadhavan, 2017 SCC OnLine Ker 11337 (2017) 4 KLJ 80 , the Kerala High Court held The inclusion of a debt in a balance sheet duly prepared and authenticated would amount to admission of a liability and therefore satisfies the requirement of law for a valid acknowledgement under Section 18 of the Act.

We may recapitulate the words of Mr. Justice P. Subramonian Poti in Krishnan Assari v. Akilakerala Viswakarma Maha Sabha 1980 KLT 515 (DB) and the following is the extract How far the balance sheets could be acted upon in deciding the claim of the appellant is the next question.	None
The appellant relies on the balance sheets as acknowledgement of liability contemplated in S. 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963.	None
Under S. 18 an acknowledgement of liability signed by the party against whom the right is claimed gives rise to a fresh period of limitation.	Reasoning
Under Explanation (b) to the Section the word signed means signed either personally or by an agent duly authorised.	None
A company being a corporate body acts through its representatives, the Managing Director and the Board of Directors.	None
Under S. 210 of the Companies Act it is the statutory duty of the Board of Directors to lay before the Company at every annual general body meeting a balance sheet and a profit and loss account for the preceding financial year.	None
S. 211 directs that the form and contents of the balance sheet should be as set out in Part I of Schedule VI.	None
The said form stipulates for the details of the loans and advances and also of sundry creditors.	None
The balance sheet should be approved by the Board of Directors, and thereafter authenticated by the Manager or the Secretary if any and not less than two directors one of whom should be the Managing Director.	None
(See S. 215).	None
The Act also provides for supply of copies of the balance sheet to the members before the company in general meeting.	None
Going by the above provisions, a balance sheet is the statement of assets and liabilities of the company as at the end of the financial year, approved by the Board of Directors and authenticated in the manner provided by law.	None
The persons who authenticate the document do so in their capacity as agents of the company.	None
The inclusion of a debt in a balance sheet duly prepared and authenticated would amount to admission of a liability and therefore satisfies the requirements of law for a valid acknowledgement under S. 18 of the Limitation Act, even though the directors by authenticating the balance sheet merely discharge a statutory duty and may not have intended to make an acknowledgement.

It is, therefore, clear that the majority decision of the Full Bench in V. Padmakumar (supra) is contrary to the aforesaid catena of judgments.	Reasoning
The minority judgment of Justice (Retd.)	Reasoning
A.I.S. Cheema, Member (Judicial), after considering most of these judgments, has reached the correct conclusion.	Reasoning
We, therefore, set aside the majority judgment of the Full Bench of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2020.	Reasoning
The NCLAT, in the impugned judgment dated 22.12.2020, has, without reconsidering the majority decision of the Full Bench in V. Padmakumar (supra), rubberstamped the same.	Reasoning
We, therefore, set aside the aforesaid impugned judgment also.	Reasoning
On the facts of this case, the NCLT, by its judgment dated 19.02.2020, recorded that the default in this case had been admitted by the corporate debtor, and that the signed balance sheet of the corporate debtor for the year 20162017 was not disputed by the corporate debtor.	Reasoning
As a result, the NCLT held that the Section 7 application was not barred by limitation, and therefore, admitted the same.	Reasoning
We have already set aside the majority judgment of the Full Bench of the NCLAT dated 12.03.2020, and the impugned judgment of the NCLAT dated 22.12.2020 in paragraphs 33 and 34.	Reasoning
This appeal is, therefore, allowed, and the matter is remanded to the NCLAT to be decided in accordance with the law laid down in our judgment.	Decision

Suffice it to say that Shri Shyam Divan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellantfinancial creditor, relied upon this Courts judgment in Vashdeo R. Bhojwani v. Abhyudaya Coop.	Arguments of Petitioner
Bank Ltd., (2019) 9 SCC 158, to argue that limitation starts running from the date a recovery certificate has been obtained pursuant to proceedings before the Debts Recovery Tribunal under the Recovery of Debts Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
On facts, he argued that such a certificate was issued on 31.08.2009 after which, there were several letters written by the corporate debtor, M s Uttara Fashion Knitwear Ltd., acknowledging liability to pay loans that had been availed by it.	Arguments of Petitioner
He pointed out that whereas the NCLT had, by an order dated 21.11.2019, admitted the appellants application under Section 7 of the IBC the NCLAT had, vide the impugned judgment, set aside the NCLT order on the ground that an entry in a balance sheet cannot amount to an acknowledgement of liability for the purpose of Section 18 of the Limitation Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
As a matter of fact, he argued, in the alternative, that even if dues were stated to be recoverable on and from the loanrecall notice dated 31.10.2002, there were balance sheets right from 2002 up till 2010, followed by various letters from the corporate debtor, which would show a consistent course of acknowledgement of liability, thereby extending limitation until the Section 7 application was filed by the appellant on 24.06.2019.	Arguments of Petitioner
He, therefore, argued that the present appeal be remanded to the NCLAT for decision on the point of limitation.	Arguments of Petitioner
2.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Jayesh Dolia, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents, argued that since service was not effected on the respondents, nobody was present before the NCLT when it passed an ex parte order admitting the Section 7 application.	Arguments of Respondent
In any event, he argued, that on the facts of this case, time began to run at least in 2002, and an application filed in 2019 obviously cannot be said to be within limitation, as the threeyear period under Article 137 of the Limitation Act has long expired.	Arguments of Respondent
We have already set aside the Full Bench judgment dated 12.03.2020 in Civil Appeal No.323 of 2021.	None
Given the argument of Shri Dolia that service was not properly effected upon the respondents, it would be in the fitness of things to send the matter back to the NCLT for a de novo hearing.	Decision

Civil Appeal No.3765 of 2020 In this appeal, Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, assails a judgment dated 14.10.2020 passed by the NCLAT.	Issue
On the facts of this case, he candidly admits that despite the fact that an application under Section 7 of the IBC was filed on 23.07.2018, and amended once, no plea qua any acknowledgement of liability was made.	Issue
The NCLT, by an order dated 14.12.2018, held that despite the fact that the corporate debtors account was declared to be a nonperforming asset from 2010 onwards, since, according to the NCLT, there was a continuing cause of action in the facts of this case, the Section 7 application was admitted.	Facts
In an appeal filed by the suspended Managing Director of the corporate debtor to the NCLAT, by an order dated 26.09.2019, the NCLAT held that the relevant date from which limitation must be determined is 01.12.2016, i.e. the date on which the IBC came into force, and therefore, dismissed the appeal.	Facts
This Court, by its order dated 21.10.2019, set aside the order of the NCLAT and remanded the matter to the NCLAT to reexamine the question of limitation, having regard to the judgments in B.K. Educational Services (P) Ltd. v. Parag Gupta Associates, (2019) 11 SCC 633 and Sagar Sharma v. Phoenix Arc (P) Ltd., (2019) 10 SCC 353.	Facts
The NCLAT, by the impugned order dated 14.10.2020, found that the appellant had classified the corporate debtors account as a nonperforming asset on 28.05.2014.	Facts
However, the said date was changed to 31.01.2010 after an attempt to restructure the corporate debtors account failed.	Facts
The three other banks forming part of the consortium of lenders, viz., Punjab National Bank, Corporation Bank, and UCO Bank, had also classified the account of the corporate debtor as a nonperforming asset on 30.06.2014, 31.12.2014, and 31.12.2014, respectively.	Facts
Even if the date of default was taken to be the last of these dates, i.e. 31.12.2014, the NCLAT held that the threeyear period under Article 137 of the Limitation Act had expired on 30.12.2017, and that since the amended application under Section 7 of the IBC had been filed only on 23.07.2018, it was barred by limitation.	Facts
The NCLAT, therefore, allowed the appeal.	Facts
Shri Rohatgi pointed out that in the written submissions filed by the appellant on 21.09.2020, after judgment was reserved by the NCLAT on 17.09.2020, it was pointed out that the corporate debtor had acknowledged its liability in its balance sheet for the year 20142015, and that 31.01.2010 could not be taken to be the date of default for the reasons given in the written submissions.	Arguments of Petitioner
These written submissions were not taken into account when the NCLAT delivered the impugned judgment.	Arguments of Petitioner
4.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents, has countered each of these submissions.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, written submissions can never be a substitute for pleadings, and if pleadings are deficient, there ends the matter.	Arguments of Respondent
Admittedly, on facts, there has never been a pleading before either the NCLT or the NCLAT that an acknowledgement of liability contained in any of the balance sheets extended limitation.	Arguments of Respondent
He also argued that, on merits, if the auditors report were to be seen, there is no acknowledgement of liability, as any socalled acknowledgement has, in fact, been qualified by notes made by the auditor.	Arguments of Respondent
This being the case, no opportunity should now be given to the appellant to go back to the NCLAT, the appellant having already amended its pleadings once, and this Court having already remanded the matter to NCLAT, which, on the second round, decided the appeal in favour of the respondents.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Rohatgi countered this by presenting an application before us to amend the pleadings, stating that this can be allowed even at this stage, as per the judgments of this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner

There can be no doubt whatsoever that the appellant has been completely remiss and deficient in pleading acknowledgement of liability on the facts of this case.	Reasoning
However, given the staggering amount allegedly due from the respondents, we afford one further opportunity to the appellant to amend its pleadings so as to incorporate what is stated in the written submissions filed by it before the NCLAT, subject to costs of Rs.1,00,000/ to be paid by the appellant to the respondents within a period of four weeks from today.	Reasoning
We, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the NCLAT dated 14.10.2020, and restore the appeal to the file to be decided in light of our judgment in Civil Appeal No. 323 of 2021.	Decision
Interim order passed by this Court on 16.12.2020 stands vacated.	Decision
Civil Appeal No.3228 of 2020 In this appeal, the judgment of the NCLAT dated 07.02.2020 is assailed, in which the NCLAT has held that entries made in balance sheets of the corporate debtor for the years ending 20142015, 20152016, and 20162017 cannot amount to acknowledgements of liability, as a result of which the NCLT order admitting the appellants application under Section 7 of the IBC was set aside.	Issue
Suffice it to say that the basis of the Section 7 application in this case was a DRT decree dated 17.08.2018, pursuant to which a recovery certificate dated 19.06.2019 was issued.	Reasoning
The Section 7 application averred that the date of the DRT decree furnished the cause of action and, thus, was the starting point of limitation in this case.	Reasoning
Shri Sidhartha Barua, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, has argued that this appeal deserves to be allowed and the matter sent back to the NCLAT to be decided in accordance with our judgment delivered in Civil Appeal No.323 of 2021.	Arguments of Petitioner
4.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Saurabh Kirpal, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents, has argued that no pleading qua acknowledgement of liability was made before either the NCLT or the NCLAT.	Arguments of Respondent
Instead, the only pleading that was made was that the date of default was the date on which the DRT decree was passed, which is wholly incorrect in law.	Arguments of Respondent
The Section 7 application being hopelessly time barred, no opportunity should now be given to the appellant to renege on this pleading.	Arguments of Respondent
As decided by us in Civil Appeal No.323 of 2021, we give one more opportunity to the appellant in this case to amend its pleading on payment of costs of Rs.1,00,000/ to the respondents within four weeks from today.	Decision
The NCLAT judgment dated 07.02.2020 is set aside and the matter is remanded to the NCLAT to decide the matter afresh in accordance with the law laid down in Civil Appeal No.323 of 2021.	Decision
Civil Appeal arising out of SLP (Civil) No.1168 of 2021 Leave granted.	None
This appeal is against the judgment dated 15.10.2020 of the Calcutta High Court which set aside two orders of the NCLT (i) order dated 19.08.2019 whereby the NCLT admitted the appellants application under Section 7 of the IBC, and (ii) order dated 20.02.2020, whereby the NCLT ordered liquidation of the corporate debtor.	Issue
Shri Sanjay Kapur, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, assailed the judgment of the Calcutta High Court, and argued that an efficacious alternative remedy was available to the respondent before the NCLAT, as a result of which the High Court ought not to have interfered with the judgment of the NCLT.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Shri Poddar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, has sought to support the judgment of the High Court with reference to Kamlesh Babu v. Lajpat Rai Sharma, (2008) 12 SCC 577, and paragraph 23 in particular, stating that a jurisdictional point was raised as to limitation, as a result of which the Calcutta High Court took up a petition filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and correctly set aside the orders of the NCLT.	Arguments of Respondent
There can be no doubt that the NCLT had, in its order dated 19.08.2019, stated that Article 63(a) of the Limitation Act would apply instead of Article 137, contrary to what has been held by us in several judgments.	Reasoning
It cannot, therefore, be said that the Calcutta High Court wrongly exercised jurisdiction in setting aside this finding.	Reasoning
However, the High Court then went on to refer to certain balance sheets that had been produced, thereby extending limitation under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, but held that given the judgment in Babulal (supra), such balance sheets could not extend limitation.	Reasoning
Given the judgment delivered in Civil Appeal No.323 of 2021, the impugned judgment in this appeal also deserves to be set aside.	Decision
The appeal is, therefore, allowed.	Decision
If the respondent wishes to file an appeal before the NCLAT against the orders of the NCLT dated 19.08.2019 and 20.02.2020, it may do so within a period of four weeks from the date of this judgment.	Decision
The appeal will thereafter be decided on its merits, keeping in view the statement of the law laid down in Civil Appeal No.323 of 2021.	Decision
