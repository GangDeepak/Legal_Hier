Initially, invoking the jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution, Unitech filed proceedings before this Court which were disposed on 1 May 2017(Writ Petition (Civil) No. 302 of 2017 (Supreme Court of India)) by granting liberty to move the High Court under Article 226.	Facts
A Writ Petition under Article 226 was instituted before the High Court for the State of Telangana(Writ Petition (Civil) No. 29722 of 2017 (Andhra Pradesh High Court)) seeking a refund of Rs 165 crores together with interest at the SBI Prime Lending Rate (SBI PLR) from the date of payments.	Facts
By a judgment and order dated 23 October 2018, a Single Judge of the High Court allowed Unitechs Writ Petition.	Facts
The concluding paragraphs 61 to 64 of the judgment are extracted below In the instant case, retention of the amounts paid by the petitioners by the respondents is against the fundamental principles of justice, equity and good conscience and clearly amounts to unjust enrichment of the respondents particularly when such a retention is arbitrary and also violates Article 14 and 300A of the Constitution of India.	Facts
Therefore, the respondents are bound to make restitution of the amounts claimed by petitioners with interest as per SBI Prime Lending Rate as per Clause 14.3.1 r w Clause 1.1.(l) of the Development Agreement from the date of receipt of the said amount till payment.	Facts
According to the petitioners, as on 30092018, the following amounts are payable Table Interest was calculated compounded annually SBI PLR Rate.	Facts
Counsel for petitioner stated that since SBI PLR was only available till 5th Oct 2015 as per SBI website, post that period, SBI PLR has been taken at same rate as 5th Oct 2015 i.e. 14.05 p.a.	Facts
The respondents have not disputed either the dates of the payments or the interest at SBI Prime Lending Rate mentioned by the petitioners or placed any material to contradict the same.	Facts
Therefore I hold that the amount of Rs.660.55 crores is due and payable to the petitioners by respondents, which shall be paid by respondents to petitioner no.3 within 4 weeks from today.	Facts
However, they are entitled to recover it from the State of Andhra Pradesh and the APIIC, if under law they are entitled to do so.	Facts
This does not preclude the petitioners from claiming other amounts from respondents towards damages under other heads, if they are entitled to do so under law.	Facts
(emphasis supplied)	None
A Writ Appeal was filed before the High Court by TSIIC and the State of Telangana(Writ Appeal No. 1594 of 2018 (Andhra Pradesh High Court)).	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court upheld the order of the Single Judge on the liability of TSIIC to refund an amount of Rs 165 crores to Unitech.	Facts
However, the Division Bench directed a refund of the principal sum of Rs 165 crores with interest from 14 October 2015 at the SBIPLR, as opposed to the dates of payment of installments, beginning from September 2007.	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court has come to the conclusion that in the exercise of the writ jurisdiction under Article 226, the Single Judges decision had aligned itself with the line of precedent of this Court justifiably entertained the writ petition and directed a refund of the consideration.	Facts
However, the order of the Single Judge directing the payment of interest compounded inter alia at the SBI PLR from the dates of payment commencing from September 2007 has been modified in terms of the direction requiring the payment of interest at the SBI PLR from 14 October 2015.	Facts
In taking this view, the Division Bench held Under the LoA dated 28 November 2007, Unitech was put to notice that the award of the contract was subject to the outcome of a litigation which was pending before the High Court Even the advertisement for the award of the contract indicated that it would be subject to the outcome of a first appeal which was pending before the High Court Unitech accepted the award of the contract on 3 December 2007 and made its payments between September 2007 and January 2008	Facts
The release of the earnest money deposit was sought on 2 April 2015 and a refund of the entire amount paid with interest, was claimed for the first time on 14 October 2015, after the judgment of the High Court attained finality through the decision of this Court dated 9 October 2015 and Unitech was aware of the pending litigation and was awaiting the outcome of the civil appeal and the tenor of the correspondence indicates that they wished to continue with the project.	Facts
On the above premises, the Division Bench of the High Court took a considered view that Unitechs request for a refund on 14 October 2015, after the decision of this Court confirming that the Government of Andhra Pradesh had no title to the land, should mark the commencement of TSIICs liability to pay interest.

Arguments of Petitioner
Relying on a line of precedent of this Court, the ASG submitted that The entire project was premised on the conveyance of title to the land, free from all encumbrances by APIIC to Unitech (b)	Arguments of Petitioner
A solemn representation was held out in the Development Agreement that APIIC was in a position to convey title and possession to Unitech following the award of the contract to it as a developer (c) Unitech fulfilled the peremptory obligation to deposit an amount of Rs 165 crores upfront (d) Political force majeure events included litigation relating to the title of APIIC or the Government of Andhra Pradesh.

The existence of an arbitration clause would not divest the High Court of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution to order refund with interest, where a private developer who has entered into an agreement on a solemn representation of the existence of title in the Government is unable to proceed with the project due to a failure of title (g) The exercise of the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 in a contractual matter is not ruled out particularly in the present case where there is absolutely no dispute in regard to the basic facts (h) The Single Judge of the High Court had justifiably awarded interest from the date of the first payment by Unitech in 2007.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Division Bench erred in restricting the grant of interest from 14 October 2015 (i)	Arguments of Petitioner
The litigation in regard to the title of the Government of Andhra Pradesh had nothing to do with the moneys paid by Unitech.	Arguments of Petitioner
When the moneys were paid in 2007, the refund of the amount must date back with reference to the date of the initial payment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the interest must be computed from the date on which each of the installments were paid and (j) When the LoA was issued on 28 November 2007, the judgment dated 23 April 2007 held the field, which was in favour of the Government of Andhra Pradesh.	Arguments of Petitioner
Its subsequent reversal would entitle the developer to a refund with interest, as contracted from the date of the initial payment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr C S Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Counsel appeared on behalf of the State of Telangana and TSIIC.	Arguments of Respondent
At the outset, he has submitted that TSIIC and the State of Telangana do not dispute The maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 before the High Court and The fact that the land comprised within the project site is not available for utilization for the project.	Arguments of Respondent
The two areas on which the submissions of Mr C S Vaidyanathan, learned Senior Counsel have been confined are firstly, whether interest at the SBIPLR and the date from which interest has been awarded by the Division Bench of the High Court are justified and secondly, whether the High Court was justified in imposing the entire liability to effect the refund on TSIIC.	Arguments of Respondent
On the award of interest, the submission is that The LoA dated 28 November 2017 furnished notice to Unitech of the pendency of the litigation Unitech and its SPV were conscious of the pendency of the appeal before the High Court arising out of the judgment dated 30 April 2007, which had ruled in favour of the title of the Government of Andhra Pradesh Unitech continued to pursue the project and did not claim political force majeure, until after the decision of this court on 09 October 2015	Arguments of Respondent
In any event, the High Court has brought about a just balancing of equities by granting interest from the date of the decision of this Court namely 14 October 2015 and The rate of interest should be suitably scaled down from the SBI PLR.	Arguments of Respondent
The above submissions in regard to the payment of interest the date from which interest should be payable and the appropriate rate of interest, were postulated on the liability to refund the principal amount to Unitech.	None
As a matter of fact, it has been expressly stated during the course of the submissions that the liability to refund is not being contested.	Arguments of Respondent
The second limb of submissions is that the liability to refund the principal amount together with interest cannot be imposed on TSIIC alone.	Arguments of Respondent
TSIIC argues that the liability to refund the principal sum together with interest to Unitech has to be apportioned between TSIIC and APIIC in terms of the provisions contained in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014.	Arguments of Respondent
The submission is elaborated along the following lines TSIIC has deposited an amount of Rs.127.53 crores before this Court in pursuance of the interim order dated 5 March 2020, out of which Rs.69.30 crores represents the principal and Rs.58.23 crores is towards interest Section 68 of the Reorganization Act stipulates that the companies specified in the IXth Schedule (including APSIIC) constituted for the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh would continue to function in those areas in respect of which they were functioning immediately before the date of reorganization.	Arguments of Respondent
Under subsection(2) of Section 68, the assets, rights and liabilities of the companies forming a part of the IXth Schedule are required to be apportioned between the successor states, in the manner indicated in Section 53 Under Section 71, the Central Government is empowered to issue directions in respect of the companies specified in the IXth Schedule inter alia for dividing the interest and shares of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh between the successor States Section 65 allows for an apportionment of assets and liabilities by agreement, while Section 66 confers power on the Central government to order an allocation or adjustment in certain cases Though the Central government constituted a Committee for the distribution of assets, it has not issued any directions, despite the committee submitting its recommendations, in view of the pendency of a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution before this Court and Section 2(h) of the Reorganization Act provides for a population ratio of 58.32 41.68 in relation to the States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, based on the 2011 census.	Arguments of Respondent
On the basis of a population ratio of approximately of 5842, TSIIC has borne 42 per cent of the liability towards the refund due to Unitech and the balance should be directed to be shared by APIIC representing the successor State of Andhra Pradesh based on the normal sharing as per the population ratio.	Arguments of Respondent
During the course of these proceedings, APIIC was directed to be impleaded.	Arguments of Respondent
APIIC has entered appearance and filed its own counter affidavit.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr Anuroop Chakravarti, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the APIIC, has opposed the submissions urged on behalf of the State of Telangana and TSIIC that the liability to refund the principal and interest must be apportioned between TSIIC and APIIC.	Arguments of Respondent
APIIC has submitted that Before the appointed date of 2 June 2014, determined under the Re organization Act, a final audit was completed on 1 June 2014 and a joint certificate was issued by the Managing Directors of TSIIC APIIC	Arguments of Respondent
The certificate issued on behalf of TSIIC and APIIC by its Managing Directors records that all the assets and liabilities having a bearing in the balance sheet as on 1 June 2014 have been audited and included in the demerger scheme and that all assets and liabilities were duly apportioned between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana under the Reorganization Act and Under the scheme of demerger apportionment, the liability in respect of the dues payable to Unitech has to be borne by TSIIC.	Arguments of Respondent
This would be evident from the terms and conditions which have been spelt out in Part II of the third Schedule.	Arguments of Respondent
The Schedule elucidates that the project site which forms the subject matter of the Development Agreement was a part of the area which falls within the jurisdiction of TSIIC.	Arguments of Respondent
The liability by the terms of the demerger scheme is that of TSIIC.	Arguments of Respondent
The Special Leave Petition(SLP (C) No. 10135 of 2019) which was filed before this Court by TSIIC raised several objections to the correctness of the order passed by the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Among the grounds which were urged in support of the Special Leave Petition were the following The High Court ought not to have entertained a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution in a pure contractual dispute The Development Agreement contains an arbitration agreement in Article 23.1 TSIIC can provide the land to Unitech and hence a direction for refund with interest ought not to have been given There was a violation by Unitech of the terms of the bid document and the LoA and the Development Agreement deviated from the bid and the LoA Unitech bid for the project and accepted the LoA with full knowledge of the pending litigation over title to the land forming a part of the agreement, and agreed to await the outcome of the litigation and APIIC entered into the agreement with Unitech and ought to share the liabilities in the population ratio of approximately 5842, as provided under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act 2014.	None
The State of Telangana, in its submissions before this Court in the Special Leave Petition had similarly assailed the judgment of the High Court on several grounds including the following The claim for refund is based on an unregistered Development Agreement which is invalid The land which is comprised in the project site can be made available for the project as the land owners have agreed to transfer the land to the Government of Telangana The terms and conditions of the LoA were not complied with by Unitech In view of the arbitration agreement, a writ petition under Article 226 could not be maintained and The liability, if any, has to be shared between the successor states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the ratio of 5842.	Arguments of Respondent
Analysis E.1.	None
Maintainability of the writ petition under Article 226 Much of the ground which was sought to be canvassed in the course of the pleadings is now subsumed in the submissions which have been urged before this Court on behalf of the State of Telangana and TSIIC.	None
As we have noted earlier, during the course of the hearing, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Telangana and TSIIC informed the Court that the entitlement of Unitech to seek a refund is not questioned nor is the availability of the land for carrying out the project being placed in issue.	Reasoning
Learned Senior Counsel also did not agitate the ground that a remedy for the recovery of moneys arising out a contractual matter cannot be availed of under Article 226 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
However, to clear the ground, it is necessary to postulate that recourse to the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution is not excluded altogether in a contractual matter.	Reasoning
A public law remedy is available for enforcing legal rights subject to wellsettled parameters.	Reasoning
A two judge Bench of this Court in ABL International Ltd. v. Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (2004) 3 SCC 553 ABL International analyzed a long line of precedent of this Court(K.N. Guruswamy v. State of Mysore, AIR 1954 SC 592 Gujarat State Financial Corporation.	Reasoning
v. Lotus Hotels (P) Ltd, (1983) 3 SCC 379 Gunwant Kaur v. Municipal Committee, Bhatinda, (1969) 3 SCC 769 )	Reasoning
to conclude that writs under Article 226 are maintainable for asserting contractual rights against the state, or its instrumentalities, as defined under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution.	Reasoning
Speaking through Justice N Santosh Hegde, the Court held 27.	Reasoning
the following legal principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a State or an instrumentality of a State arising out of a contractual obligation is maintainable.	Reasoning
Merely because some disputed questions of fact arise for consideration, same cannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases as a matter of rule.	None
A writ petition involving a consequential relief of monetary claim is also maintainable.	Reasoning
This exposition has been followed by this Court, and has been adopted by three judge Bench decisions of this Court in State of UP v. Sudhir Kumar 2020 Scconline SC 847 and Popatrao Vynkatrao Patil v. State of Maharashtra(Civil Appeal 1600 of 2000 (Supreme Court of India)).	Reasoning
The decision in ABL International, cautions that the plenary power under Article 226 must be used with circumspection when other remedies have been provided by the contract.	Reasoning
But as a statement of principle, the jurisdiction under Article 226 is not excluded in contractual matters.	Reasoning
Article 23.1 of the Development Agreement in the present case mandates the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration.	Reasoning
However, the presence of an arbitration clause within a contract between a state instrumentality and a private party has not acted as an absolute bar to availing remedies under Article 226.11 If the state instrumentality violates its constitutional mandate under Article 14 to act fairly and reasonably, relief under the plenary powers of the Article 226 of the Constitution would lie.	Reasoning
This principle was recognized in ABL International However, while entertaining an objection as to the maintainability of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the court should bear in mind the fact that the power to issue prerogative writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the Constitution.	Reasoning
The High Court having regard to the facts of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition.	Reasoning
The Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions in the exercise of this power.	Reasoning
(See Whirlpool Corpn.	Reasoning
v. Registrar of Trade Marks (1998) 8 SCC 1 .)	Reasoning
And this plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless such action of the State or its instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional mandate of Article 14 or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for which the Court thinks it necessary to exercise the said jurisdiction.	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied)	None
Therefore, while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226, the Court is entitled to enquire into whether the action of the State or its instrumentalities is arbitrary or unfair and in consequence, in violation of Article 14.	Reasoning
The jurisdiction under Article 226 is a valuable constitutional safeguard against an arbitrary exercise of state power or a misuse of authority.	Reasoning
In determining as to whether the jurisdiction should be exercised in a contractual dispute, the Court must, undoubtedly eschew, disputed questions of fact which would depend upon an evidentiary determination requiring a trial.	Reasoning
But equally, it is wellsettled that the jurisdiction under Article 226 cannot be ousted only on the basis that the dispute pertains to the contractual arena.	Reasoning
This is for the simple reason that the State and its instrumentalities are not exempt from the duty to act fairly merely because in their business dealings they have entered into the realm of contract.	Reasoning
Similarly, the presence of an arbitration clause does oust the jurisdiction under Article 226 in all cases though, it still needs to be decided from case to case as to whether recourse to a public law remedy can justifiably be invoked.	Reasoning
The jurisdiction under Article 226 was rightly invoked by the Single Judge and the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh in this case, when the foundational representation of the contract has failed.	Reasoning
TSIIC, a state instrumentality, has not just reneged on its contractual obligation, but hoarded the refund of the principal and interest on the consideration that was paid by Unitech over a decade ago.	Reasoning
It does not dispute the entitlement of Unitech to the refund of its principal.	Reasoning
E.2 Contractual right to compensatory payment In the present case, the basic postulate underlying the contract between the parties was the availability of the land which comprised the project site.	None
The LoA dated 28 November 2007, stated that the allotment of land was subject to the outcome of the pending appeal before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh.	Reasoning
The dispute over the title of the Government of Andhra Pradesh was the subject of the pending litigation.	Reasoning
At the same time, the LoA mandated that Unitech must pay the amount stipulated  including the purchase price of Rs.145 crores for the land as well as the project development expenses.	Reasoning
A failure to do so would constitute a significant event of default resulting in a forfeiture of the earnest money deposit.	Reasoning
Acting on the LoA, Unitech did in fact comply with its obligation to pay, having paid a total amount of Rs.165 crores towards the purchase price, besides the earnest money deposit and project development expenses.	Reasoning
The Development Agreement which was executed between APIIC and Unitech contains specific representations to the effect that APIIC was authorized to transfer and deliver the project site admeasuring 350 acres on an outright sale basis.	Reasoning
Under the Development Agreement, APIIC was to sell and transfer the land absolutely together with its right, title and interest, free from all encumbrances by executing a sale agreement.	Reasoning
The terms of the agreement were to prevail in the event of any conflict with any other document which formed a part of the bidding process.	Reasoning
The terms of the agreement were placed on the pedestal of the highest priority for interpretation, as compared to other documents, including the LoA. Under the terms of the Development Agreement, APIIC was obligated to sell and transfer the land together with its right, title and interest free from all encumbrances forthwith upon payment of the last installment of the total purchase price by the developer.	Reasoning
That Unitech paid the total purchase price is not in dispute.	Reasoning
The obligation assumed by APIIC to handover possession together with title upon the payment of the last installment of the purchase price unequivocally emerges from Article 3.1 and Article 4.1 of the Development Agreement.	Reasoning
The fulfillment of the terms of the agreement was postulated on the availability of the land.	Reasoning
Apart from the terms of the agreement which have already been emphasized, representations in regard to the title to the land are expressly contained in Annexure 1C of the Development Agreement which reads as follows APIIC hereby represents and warrants to the Developer and Unitech that APIIC is absolutely seized and possessed of and is otherwise well and sufficiently entitled to the Project site.	None
GOAP has free clear and marketable titled to the Project site, and that no Encumbrance of any nature whatsoever exists in respect of the Project site.	None
APIIC was in possession and occupation of the Project site until the date of execution of the Development Agreement and that peaceful physical vacant possession and occupation of the Project site has been handed over to the Developer in terms of the Development Agreement.	None
APIIC has been duly authorized to enter into the Development Agreement and perform all of its obligations there under.	None
Annexure2 to the Development Agreement sets out a list of ownership documents which are tabulated in the following terms Image	None
The consequences of default are expressly stipulated in the agreement.	None
Article 17 stipulates force majeure events.	None
Article 17.2 provides for political force majeure events comprising inter alia direct litigation related to APIICs GoAPs title to the project site, stay interim injunctive other orders issued by the Court Article 14.3.4 expressly stipulates that the developer shall not be liable for the failure to meet any of its obligations under the agreement, in the event, that it could be attributed to a default or delay on the part of APIIC in fulfilling its obligations.	None
Similarly, the developer would not be held liable as a result of encumbrances or title issues on any portion of the land which may have a material adverse effect on the project or as a consequence of force majeure events.	Reasoning
Article14.3.1 stipulates that in the event that APIIC Government of Andhra Pradesh were unable to execute the sale deed in favour of the developer in respect of the land within the time specified, APIIC shall, if so required for the developer, make compensatory payment subject to court orders.	Reasoning
In the event of a political force majeure event, Unitech was, in terms of Article 17.6, solely entitled to issue a notice of termination, if it resulted in a material adverse effect on the project, continuing for more than nine months.	Reasoning
In that event, APIIC was obligated to make the compensatory payment to the developer.	Reasoning
Compensatory payment liable to be paid in terms of the agreement is expressly defined, including for the purposes of Article 14.3.1, to mean an amount which is the aggregate of (i) the total purchase price and (ii) interest calculated at the SBIPLR on the total purchase price from the date on which the first payment of purchase price in respect of compensated land is paid.	Reasoning
The applicable rate was also defined(Article 1(h)	Reasoning
Applicable Rate means the prime lending rate of the State Bank of India, compounded annually.)	Reasoning
to mean the Prime Lending Rate of the SBI, compounded annually.	Reasoning
The failure of title in the erstwhile APIIC and the Government of Andhra Pradesh attained finality upon the decision of this Court in State of Andhra Pradesh Through Principal Secretary v. Pratap Karan (2016) 2 SCC 82.	Reasoning
The basic postulate on which the entire contract was founded stood nullified as a consequence of the failure of title.	Reasoning
The agreement clearly provides that the ability of the Government of Andhra Pradesh TSIIC to convey full title to the developer forms the basis of the contract.	Reasoning
The failure of title entitles Unitech to claim a full refund together with compensatory payment, as contractually defined.	Reasoning
The claim does not raise a disputed question of fact requiring an evidentiary determination.	Reasoning
Both the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court have elaborately considered the precedents of this Court and correctly concluded that Unitech is entitled to a refund.	Reasoning
The finding in regard to the entitlement of Unitech to a refund is unexceptionable and has correctly not been called into question at the stage of the hearing, despite the grounds which were raised in the pleadings in the proceedings initiated under Article 136 of the Constitution by TSIIC and the State of Telangana.	Reasoning
APIIC, as an instrumentality of the erstwhile Government of Andhra Pradesh, invited bids for a public project.	Reasoning
Having invited private entrepreneurs to submit bids on stipulated terms and conditions, it must be held down to make good its representations.	Reasoning
The State and its instrumentalities are duty bound to act fairly under Article 14 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
They cannot, even in the domain of contract, claim an exemption from the public law duty to act fairly.	Reasoning
The State and its instrumentalities do not shed either their character or their obligation to act fairly in their dealings with private parties in the realm of contract.	Reasoning
Investors who respond to the representations held out by the State while investing in public projects are legitimately entitled to assert that the representations must be fulfilled and to enforce compliance with duties which have been contractually assumed.	Reasoning
The Single Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in the course of the judgment dated 23 October 2018 computed as on 30 September 2018, an amount of Rs.660.55 crores as due and payable.	Reasoning
Interest on the basis of the SBIPLR was compounded annually in terms of the provisions of the Development Agreement.	Reasoning
The Single Judge noted that the respondents to the writ proceedings had not disputed (i) the dates of payment or (ii) interest at the rate of the SBIPLR and no material to contradict the computation was submitted.	Reasoning
In appeal, the Division Bench however directed that the claim for interest should be computed from 14 October 2015.	Reasoning
This was the date on which Unitech addressed a communication seeking a refund of the compensatory payment following the decision of this Court on 9 October 2015 on the absence of title to the land in the Government of Andhra Pradesh.	Reasoning
The Division Bench has proceeded on the rationale that Unitech was placed on notice that the award of the contract was subject to the outcome of the appeal in the High Court and Unitech was aware of the outcome of the first appeal yet, as a developer, it wanted to continue with the project.	Reasoning
The above circumstances have no bearing on whether Unitech is entitled to a refund of moneys from the date of initial payment.	Reasoning
The entitlement of Unitech to a refund of the amounts paid is embodied in the terms of the contract which envisage that a default on the part of APIIC in conveying the land or the existence of political force majeure events would furnish a valid basis for the compensatory payment.	Reasoning
Moreover, the date from which compensatory payment has to be made is specifically provided the Development Agreement provides that it will be from the date on which the first payment of project price is made.	Reasoning
The Division Bench was in error in curtailing the right of Unitech to claim a refund with effect from the dates on which the respective payments were made.	Reasoning
Obviously, Unitech had entered into the project since it wished to pursue it.	Reasoning
Unitech cannot be penalized for wanting to continue with the agreement, as APIIC navigated disputes over its claim to the land.	Reasoning
While Unitech was put to notice of the existence of a litigation, the Development Agreement which stipulated an encumbrancefree handover also specified that its covenants would supersede all other understandings and that its terms would rank as the first, in order of interpretive priority.	Reasoning
The judgment of the Division Bench suffers from a clear and patent error in restricting the liability of paying interest with effect from 14 October 2015.	Reasoning
The liability must date back, in terms of the Development Agreement, from the date on which the respective payments were made by Unitech.	Reasoning
Interest at the contractual SBIPLR rate has to be paid to Unitech.	Reasoning
However, considering the facts and circumstances of this case, the conscionability of Article 14.3.1 read with Article 1(h) of the Development Agreement stipulating compensatory payment at the SBIPLR, compounded annually, becomes suspect.	Reasoning
Clause 17 of the LoA expressly mentioned that the title of the land is lis pendens and subject to the outcome of the proceedings pending before the Andhra Pradesh High Court.	Reasoning
Unitech considered this circumstance and consciously entered into the Development Agreement.	Reasoning
It continued to liaise with APIIC after an unfavorable judgement of the Andhra Pradesh High Court and did not issue a termination notice, until the title was conclusively denied by a judgement of this Court.	Reasoning
A Constitution Bench of this Court, in the case of Central Bank of India v. Ravindra (2002) 1 SCC 367 , when considering the question of penal interest rates, had observed 39 Presuit interest is referable to substantive law and can be subdivided into two subheads (i) where there is a stipulation for the payment of interest at a fixed rate and (ii) where there is no such stipulation.	None
If there is a stipulation for the rate of interest, the court must allow that rate up to the date of the suit subject to three exceptions (i) any provision of law applicable to moneylending transactions, or usury laws or any other debt law governing the parties and having an overriding effect on any stipulation for payment of interest voluntarily entered into between the parties (ii) if the rate is penal, the court must award at such rate as it deems reasonable (iii) even if the rate is not penal the court may reduce it if the interest is excessive and the transaction was substantially unfair.	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied)	None
In a similar vein, in interpreting Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, this Court has held that a contractuallystipulated interest rate, if found to be penal, excessive or in terrorem can be reduced to a reasonable rate of compensation.(Oriental Kuries Ltd. v. Lissa, (2019) 19 SCC 732 Bhubaneshwar Development Authority v.	Reasoning
Susanta Kumar Mishra, (2009) 4 SCC 684 )	None
In upholding the reasoning of the Kerala High Court in full, a two judge Bench of this Court in K P Subbarama Sastri v. KS Raghavan (1987) 2 SCC 424 held 5The question whether a particular stipulation in a contractual agreement is in the nature of a penalty has to be determined by the court against the background of various relevant factors, such as the character of the transaction and its special nature, if any, the relative situation of the parties, the rights and obligations accruing from such a transaction under the general law and the intention of the parties in incorporating in the contract the particular stipulation which is contended to be penal in nature.	Reasoning
If on such a comprehensive consideration, the court finds that the real purpose for which the stipulation was incorporated in the contract was that by reason of its burdensome or oppressive character it may operate in terrorem over the promiser so as to drive him to fulfil the contract,, then the provision will be held to be one by way of penalty.	Reasoning
Therefore, considering the position of Unitechwhich knowingly entered into the Development Agreement with full knowledge of the pending litigation and with an intention to continue with the project after a delay of over seven years, up until a decision by this Court, we find that the interest rate is payable to Unitech, without compounding.	Reasoning
E.3 Apportionment of the liabilities between the instrumentalities of the state of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana This leaves the court with the last facet which pertains to the dispute inter se between TSIIC and APIIC.	None
The Single Judge has imposed the liability to refund on TSIIC clarifying however, that it is entitled to recover it from the State of Andhra Pradesh and the APIIC, if under law they are entitled to do so.	Reasoning
The Division Bench has not interfered with the above direction.	Reasoning
Section 68 of the Reorganization Act is comprised in Part VII which enunciates Provisions as to Certain Corporations.	None
Section 68 of the Reorganization Act provides as follows 68.	None
(1) The companies and corporations specified in the Ninth Schedule constituted for the existing State of Andhra Pradesh shall, on and from the appointed day, continue to function in those areas in respect of which they were functioning immediately before that day, subject to the provision of this section.	Facts
The assets, rights and liabilities of the companies and corporations referred to in subsection (1) shall be apportioned between the successor States in the manner provided in section 53.	Facts
The corporations which are listed out in the IXth Schedule include APIIC which appears at Serial No.17.	Reasoning
Section 68(2) states that the assets, rights and liabilities of the companies and corporations referred to in subSection (1) shall be re apportioned between the successor states in the manner provided in Section 53.	Reasoning
Section 53 is in the following terms 53.	None
(1) The assets and liabilities relating to any commercial or industrial undertaking of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh, where such undertaking or part thereof is exclusively located in, or its operations are confined to, a local area, shall pass to the State in which that area is included on the appointed day, irrespective of the location of its headquarters Provided that where the operation of such undertaking becomes interState by virtue of the provisions of Part II, the assets and liabilities of (a) the operational units of the undertaking shall be apportioned between the two successor States on location basis and (b) the headquarters of such undertaking shall be apportioned between the two successor States on the basis of population ratio.	Arguments of Respondent
Upon apportionment of the assets and liabilities, such assets and liabilities shall be transferred in physical form on mutual agreement or by making payment or adjustment through any other mode as may be agreed to by the successor States.	None
Section 65 allows for the successor states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to agree on the manner in which the benefit or burden of any particular asset or liability can be apportioned.	Reasoning
Section 66 empowers the Central Government on a reference made, within three years from the appointed date, by either of the successor states to order an adjustment or allocation of the liability.	Reasoning
Finally, to complete the narration of the statutory scheme, Section 71 is in the following terms Notwithstanding anything in this Part, the Central Government may, for each of the companies specified in the Ninth Schedule to this Act, issue directions Regarding the division of the interests and shares of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh in the Company between the successor states Requiring the reconstitution of the Board of Directors of the Company so as to give adequate representations is the successor States.	Facts
Section 71(a) speaks of the interests and shares of the existing State of Andhra Pradesh in the companies specified in the IXth Schedule between the successor States.	Reasoning

We clarify that following the course of action which has been adopted by the learned Single Judge, we are not adjudicating finally upon the rights inter se between TSIIC and APIIC.	Reasoning
TSIIC shall refund the amounts due and payable to Unitech in terms of the present judgment.	Reasoning
TSIIC would be at liberty to pursue its rights and remedies in accordance with law over its claim for apportionment on which, we express no final opinion.	Reasoning
Summation TSIIC and the State of Telangana have brought to our notice that the Development Agreement, on the basis of which Unitech has sought to avail its contractual remedy has not been registered or assessed to stamp duty.	Reasoning
Under Article 3.1 of the Development Agreement, the obligation of paying registration fees and stamp duty is on Unitech.	Reasoning
It is wellsettled law that the Stamp Act is a fiscal measure enacted to secure the revenue for the State, and not to arm the opponent with a weapon of technicality.(Hindustan Steel Limited v. Dilip Construction Company, (1969) 1 SCC 597 para 7) Unitechs claim to compensatory payment cannot be defeated on the sole ground of the payment of stamp duty.	Reasoning
The Development Agreement shall have to be impounded and be presented to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority in the State of Telangana for assessment of stamp duty and to the competent authority for registration.	Reasoning
The assessment shall be completed within thirty days.	Reasoning
The appropriate stamp duty and registration charges liable to be paid in terms of the determination shall be paid by TSIIC and be deducted from the refund due and payable to Unitech under the terms of this order.	Reasoning
For the above reasons, the appeals shall stand disposed of in the following terms The Development Agreement stands impounded and shall be forwarded by TSIIC within two weeks to the competent authority for registration and for assessment of stamp duty.	Decision
The assessment to stamp duty and formalities for registration shall be completed within one month.	Decision
