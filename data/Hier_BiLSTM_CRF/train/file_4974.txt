When second appeal was preferred an interim stay was granted by the High Court as such payment of the cheque for further amount was stopped.	Arguments of Petitioner
As a matter of fact, the decree holder was not entitled for the amount for which the compromise had been entered into.	Arguments of Petitioner
As a matter of fact, Respondent(s) had received a sum of Rs. 8,46,053/ which was far in excess of the decretal amount.	Arguments of Petitioner
As per the learned counsel appearing for the appellants, a sum of Rs. 7,27,233/ had been paid excess.6.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted on behalf of respondent(s) decree holder that no evidence was led by the State of Madhya Pradesh to prove factum of sale of goods and value fetched by the State of Madhya Pradesh on sale of timber.	Arguments of Respondent
The value of the timber was lower at that time but it has gone very high at present.	Arguments of Respondent
The wheels of saw machine were not given back and due to the appeal preferred by the State of Madhya Pradesh the license had not been renewed by the State of Uttar Pradesh, the respondent decree holder has suffered loss w.e.f 1992 for last 25 years and once compromise had been entered into before the executing court, it ought to be honoured by the State of Madhya Pradesh.7.	Arguments of Respondent
After hearing learned counsel for the parties, in our opinion, the executing court while fastening liability has gone beyond the scope of the decree.	Reasoning
Whereas it was required to execute the decree as it stood and could not have found more items to be handed over which were not reflected in the seizure list as well as in Superdaginama.	Reasoning
The finding beyond that was rendered illegally.	Reasoning
Thus, executing court has committed gross illegality in exceeding its powers, it was not legitimate and it went beyond decree while awarding compensation.	Reasoning
As a matter of fact, the list of seizure of articles prepared on 19.11.1992 and the list of items reflected in Superdaginama tally with each other and it was clear that what had been seized had been returned except timber.	Reasoning
The submission raised by decree holder that the wheels of the saw machine were not handed over, is wholly incorrect.	Reasoning
It is mentioned in Superdaginama that three wheels were returned back.	Reasoning
Thus, seized motors and tools were handed back as such the decree stood satisfied with respect to the return of the machinery of saw mill i.e. motors and tools etc. by the State of Madhya Pradesh.	Reasoning
However, other part, which remained to be complied by the State of Madhya Pradesh, was with respect to the return of timber.8.	Reasoning
Since, order of the executing court has also been questioned before us, it is apparent that the decree holder has realized more amount than the one which could be legally realized under the decree.	Reasoning
No doubt about it that the decree was required to be complied with respect to the return of the timber also.	Reasoning
Fact remains that it was sold in auction.	Reasoning
There is nothing to doubt about the factum of sale of the timber seized by the State of Madhya Pradesh in the year 1992 in which the timber was sold for a sum of Rs. 26,202/.	Reasoning
The timber once sold could not have been returned back.	Reasoning
Thus, the decree holder would be entitled to price of the timber for which it was sold along with the interest thereupon.9.	Reasoning
It appears that the decree holder was entitled for a sum of Rs. 92,618/ plus Rs. 26,202/ along with interest but had received a sum of Rs. 8,46,053/.	Reasoning
The State of Madhya Pradesh was required to furnish proof of sale of timber before trial court when it had sold the timber it remained exparte and payment of the price of timber was not made timely.10.	Reasoning
Thus, in exercise of our powers to do complete justice between the parties, we direct that total sum of Rs. 5 lacs would be sufficient towards full and final settlement of decree by the State of Madhya Pradesh, to be adjusted out of amount already received by decree holder.	Decision
Let amount of Rs. 5 lacs be retained out of amount which has been paid to the decree holder and the remaining amount shall be returned by decree holder to the State of Madhya Pradesh, within a period of three months from today and report the compliance to this court.11.	Decision
The executing court on behalf of the decree holder or the State of Madhya Pradesh shall entertain no further objection.	Decision
It is open to the respondent decree holder to approach to the State of Uttar Pradesh in accordance with decree subject to fulfillment of the conditions.12.	Decision
The impugned judgment passed by the High Court is set aside.	Decision
The order of executing court is also set aside.	Decision
The appeals, accordingly, stands disposed of.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
