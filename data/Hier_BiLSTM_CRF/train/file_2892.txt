AHMADI, J. Special leave granted in the aforesaid special leave petitions.	None
Five references bearing Nos. (i) 123 of 1977, (ii) 215 of 1979, (iii) 91 of 1984, (iv) 92 of 1984 and (v) 43 of 1985, the first three under Section 10(2) and the remaining two under Section10(1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, hereinafter called the I. D. Act, arose out of certain demands made by the workmenemployees of Hindustan Lever Limited as well as the Managements Notice of Change for the imposition of a ceiling on dearness allowance.	Facts
These disputes concerned the demands made by the monthlyrated clerical and technical staff working at the Sewree factory of the Company as well as the monthlyrated C T categories of workmen employed at the Companys head office and branch office in Bombay, the former represented by Hindustan Lever Employees Union, hereinafter called the Union and the latter represented by Hindustan Lever Mazdoor Sabha, hereinafter called the Sabha.	Facts
The Company had desired placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance based on the premise that in the absence of such a ceiling the neutralisation factor exceeded 100.	Facts
It may here be mentioned that both the clerical and technical staff of the Company was, at all material times classified into four categories, namely, C1 to C4 and T1 to T4 carrying different pay scales.	Facts
The clerical staff worked for 36 hours a week whereas the technical staff worked for 48 hours a week.	Facts
It is not necessary for us to indicate the nature of demands made by the workmen in the aforesaid references because we are, in the present appeals, mainly concerned with the Companys demand for placing a ceiling on dearness allowance.	Facts
The Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra, by its award dated 18121985 conceded the demand of the management for the placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance on basic pay exceeding Rs. 500 per month.	Facts
The Tribunal also granted certain demands of the workmen in regard to upward revision of pay scales, grant of special allowance, social security allowance, ad hoc allowance, automatic promotion scheme, etc., but since we are concerned with the limited question in regard to the placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance as demanded by the management, it is unnecessary for us to refer to the demands of the workmen which were no conceded by the Tribunal and against which the workmen had approached the High Court.	Facts
The workmen had also challenged the Tribunals award conceding the managements demand for placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance.	Facts
The learned Single Judge who heard the writ petition upheld the order of the Industrial Tribunal placing a ceiling on dearness allowance but modified the award with regard to certain other demands.	Facts
Against the decision of the learned Single Judge appeals were carried to the Division Bench of the High Court.	Facts
IN the said appeals the Division Bench was called upto to examine the correctness of the view taken by the Industrial Tribunal in regard to the placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance which came to be affirmed by the learned Single Judge.	Facts
In addition the Division Bench was also invited to deal with the demand for automatic promotion which was conceded by the Tribunal but spurned by the learned Single Judge who substituted it by the grant of stagnation increment.	Facts
The management also made a grievance before the Division Bench in regard to grant of stagnation increment and upward revision of wages.	Facts
The Division Bench rejected the managements plea against stagnation increment but preferred to make a remand in respect of wage revision.	Facts
The major issue was, however, in regard to ceiling fixed on dearness allowance where basic wage exceeded Rs. 500.3.	Facts
Under the extent scheme, the dearness allowance was linked to index 1450 of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Bombay (1934100) at 635 of basic wage for the first Rs. 100, at 284.25 of basic wage for the second Rs. 100 and at 251 of basic wage where the salary exceeded Rs. 200 per month.	Facts
This was the Fixed Dearness Allowance (FDA) payable to the workmen.	Facts
However, on the CPI exceeding 1450, the Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) was payable on every 10 points rise at 5 of basic wage for the first Rs. 100, 2.25 of basic wage for the second Rs. 100 and 2 of basic wage on salary exceeding Rs. 200 per month.	Facts
The Companys demand was that the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be applicable to workmen whose basic salary, inclusive of dearness allowance, did not exceed Rs. 1500 per month.	Facts
However, for those whose basic salary, inclusive of dearness allowance, exceeded the said figure of Rs. 1500 per month, it was contended that the existing scheme should continue up to the CPI point of 1450 and for every 10 points rise above the same, 5 of basic wage should be allowed for first Rs. 100 and 1 of basic wage for the second Rs. 100 and to these whose basic wage exceeded Rs. 200 the workmen should not be paid any FDA.	Facts
So far as VDA is concerned, it was contended that it should be subject to a maximum of Rs. 1, 310 for C1, Rs. 1, 535 for C2, Rs. 1725 for C3, and Rs. 1900 for C4 categories of clerical employees and Rs. 1285 for T1, Rs. 1600 for T2, Rs. 1775 for T3 and Rs. 2025 for T4 categories of technical employees.	Facts
The Tribunal while continuing the existing scheme directed that the maximum dearness allowance payable to the workmen shall be that which is payable to a workman drawing a basic salary of Rs. 500.	Facts
To put it differently the Tribunal directed that those workmen drawing a salary exceeding Rs. 500 per month will get the same dearness allowance as admissible to those drawing a basic salary of Rs. 500 per month without their being any variation in the dearness allowance for salary slabs exceeding Rs. 500 per month.	Facts
This direction given by the Tribunal was made retrospective from 1101979.	Facts
Those workmen who received dearness allowance in excess of the scheme worked by the Tribunal between 1101979 and 30121985, the date of the award, were directed to refund the excess amount by adjusting the same against dearness allowance payable to them subsequent to 30121985.	Facts
Thus the dearness allowance scheme worked out by the Tribunal immediately affected those workmen whose basic salary exceeded Rs. 500 per month and was likely to affect those who crossed the Rs. 500 mark at a future date.	Facts
The contention of the management before the Tribunal was that the slab system of dearness allowance was unrealistic is it had the effect of distorting the entire wagestructure as it exceeded the 100 neutralisation factor which has always been the justification for the introduction of the dearness allowance formula.4.	Facts
Indisputably the existing dearness allowance formula was in vogue for many years before the Company gave a Notice of Change under Section9A of the I. D. Act sometime in 1976.	Facts
The Company had entered into settlements in 1979 and 1983 with a section of the workmen whereunder it has agreed to continue the existing dearness allowance formula at certain levels of salary.	Facts
It is unnecessary to go into the details in regard to the said settlements but if would be sufficient to say that the extant scheme provided neutralisation at the lowest level varying between 95 and 100 whereas for those drawing higher pay the neutralisation was much more than ordinarily granted to that class of employees.	Facts
The main justification for imposition of a ceiling on dearness allowance payable to workmen drawing a basic salary exceeding Rs. 500 per month was that it exceeded what other comparable companies paid by way of dearness allowance to those whose basic wage exceeded Rs. 500 per month.	Facts
The Tribunal noted that in such comparable companies, having no ceiling on VDA, the percentage of dearness allowance was quite low and, therefore, it did not result in any distortion in the wagestructure.	Facts
The learned Single Judge while examining the impact of the dearness allowance formula on the wagestructure pointed out that the emoluments of workmen exceed the emoluments received by the junior executive staff of the Company notwithstanding the fact that the latter are promotion posts.	Facts
Due to this reason workmen are unwilling to accept promotions as that would result in a shrinkage in their total emoluments.	Facts
Such a situation, points out the learned single Judge, is not conducive to efficient working of the Company.	Facts
In this view of the matter the learned Single Judge upheld the award insofar as it placed a ceiling on dearness allowance as explained earlier.	Facts
It also upheld the Tribunals decision making the same retrospective w. e. f. 1101979.5.	Facts
It may be mentioned that the Tribunal while placing a ceiling on dearness allowance granted an upward revision in the wages.	Facts
One of the justifications for the upward revision of basic salary was the placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance, vide paragraph 53 of the Award.	Facts
The second reason was that the basic wage paid to workmen in TOMCO was higher at the maximum levels and, therefore, there was justification for increasing the maxima of the scales applicable to each category of workmen of the Company.	Facts
In that view of the matter the Tribunal revised the basic wage of the workmen belonging to C1 to C4 categories and T1 to T4 categories as is evident from paragraph 53 of the Award.	Facts
The revised wagestructure was also brought into force from 1101979.	Facts
It will thus be seen that the placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance had a direct nexus to the Tribunal revising the salary structure of a aforesaid categories of employees.	Facts
Secondly the Tribunal also opted in favour of timebound automatic promotion.	Facts
The other demands conceded by the Tribunal have no direct bearing on the question of placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance and, therefore, need not be adverted to.	Facts
The learned Single Judge while affirming the Tribunals decision in regard to placement of ceiling on dearness allowance granted stagnation increment in lieu of the Tribunals formula in regard to timebound automatic promotion.	Facts
It will thus be seen that over and above the upward revision of the salaries sanctioned by the Tribunal, the learned Single Judge granted stagnation increment as a substitute for the automatic promotion scheme introduced by the Tribunal.	Facts
The grant of stagnation increment, therefore, it is contended has a direct nexus to the ceiling on dearness allowance.6.	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court upheld the learned Single judges view that timebound automatic promotion would adversely affect merit and, therefore, upheld its substitution by stagnation increment.	Facts
It disapproved of the ceiling on dearness allowance and summed up its conclusion in that behalf in paragraph 42 of the judgment as under To sum up, the present dearness allowance system, as shown above, does not result in overneutralisation of the cost of living index at any level of the income group.	Facts
It maintains a tapering scale, though not a steeply declining one.	Facts
The system also does not result in distortion of total incomes either of the workmen inter se or between the workmen and their superiors, namely, the executive staff.	Facts
The Company does not plead any financial inability.	Facts
The industrycumregion formula does not warrant its replacement.	Facts
There are no other compelling reasons why the existing system which is beneficial to the workmen should be replaced by the new one which is less beneficial to them and which would result in steep decline in their incomes they would otherwise gain.	Facts
It is a wellrecognized principle of industrial adjudication that the courts, wage bodies and the industrial adjudicators should not tinker with the existing benefits available to the workmen unless it becomes unavoidable and obligatory to do so.	Facts
The Company has failed to make out any such case.	None
However, in regard to the upward revision of wages it felt the issue should go back to the Tribunal for a de novo consideration whether in view of the rejection of the managements demand for a ceiling on dearness allowance, upward revision of wages was any more justified.	Facts
This is how the Division Bench concluded in paragraph 48 of its judgment We have commented upon the approach of the Tribunal and the learned Judge by observing that to the extent that they have mixed up the considerations for increasing the wage scale with those for fixing the dearness allowance, they have committed an error apparent on the face of the record.	Facts
It cannot also be gainsaid that one of the main considerations, which has weighed with the Tribunal, while introducing the revised pay scales is that it was introducing the ceiling on dearness allowance, for those earning salary above Rs. 500 per month.	Facts
In fact, as pointed out earlier, what the Tribunal has done is to give by way of some increase in the maximum of the pay scale, particularly to those in Category C3, C4 and T3 and T4, what it has taken away from them by reduction in dearness allowance.	Facts
Thus both the revision of salary and introduction of the new dearness allowance system are interlinked.	Facts
Since we are setting aside the award with regard to the dearness allowance and directing the continuation of the existing dearness allowance system, it is only fair that the remand the matter to the Tribunal to consider the case for revision of wage scales afresh independently and irrespective of the change in the dearness allowance system which was proposed by it.	Facts
We are aware that this would involve prolongation of the letigation between the parties.	Facts
But in the circumstances it is unavoidable.	Facts
We, therefore, set aside the award with regard to the revision of wage scale and remand the demand of the workmen for the revision of wage scales to the Tribunal for fresh consideration, in the light of what we have stated hereinabove.	Facts
The issue of upward revision of wages was, therefore, remanded to the Tribunal in the aforestated circumstances.7.	None
After the matter went back to the Tribunal, the Tribunal went into the question whether or not an upward revision of wages for the clerical and technical staff was called for.	Facts
On the question of financial capacity of the employercompany it rightly concluded that the financial position of the Company was sound and the Company was in a position to bear an additional financial burden.	Facts
On this point there was no controversy even before us.	Facts
Secondly it compared the extant wagestructure with the wagestructure prevailing in comparable similar concerns and came to the conclusion in paragraph 25 of its order dated 2561991 as under To sum up, since 1970 there is no wage revision as such in HLL Company in respect of the employees of C1 to C4 and T1 to T4 grades.	Facts
As in 1970 there was Reference, which has been decided by the President, Shri Chitale in 1974 and Shri Bhojwani, J. slightly modified it.	Facts
Thus for allowing the period till today, there is no revision of wage scales.	Facts
Admittedly the cost of living index has increased from 1400 to 2900 and in September 1990 it is 4524.	Facts
Considering this, it is clear that there is justification for the wage scale, as demanded by the workmen.	Facts
Party allowing the Reference the Tribunal revised the wage scales w. e. f. 1101970 as under Clerical Grade Modified DemandC1 16015445 C2 21118553 C3 22020620 C4 26022700Technical GradeT1 20017523 T2 25020630 T3 27022710 T4 32025820It is against this order of the Tribunal in Reference No. 1233 of 1977 that Special Leave Petition Nos. 1455859 of 1991 came to be preferred.9.	Facts
Against the aforesaid decision of the Division Bench of the High Court the Company approached this Court seeking special leave to appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution.	Facts
Pending grant of special leave an ad interim stay was granted against the implementation of the judgment of the Division Bench.	Facts
Ultimately this Court while granting special leave vacated the ad interim stay of the judgment of the Division Bench.	Facts
The Company, therefore, become liable to implement the award as modified by the judgment and order of the Division Bench.	Facts
Despite the same the workmen complained that the Company had failed to implement the Award as modified by the Division Bench in regard to grant of stagnation increment to those employees who had reached the maxima in their pay scales and were entitled to stagnation increment every alternate year of their service from 1101979 and that the Company had refused to pay the dues under the modified Award to those employees who had in the meantime retired or left service of the Company.	Facts
Complaint was, therefore, lodged with the Tribunal under Item No. 9 of Schedule IV of the MRTU and PULP Act.	Facts
This complaint was contested by the Company.	Facts
The Tribunal after considering the various contentions raised on behalf of the Company came to the conclusion that the Company had engaged in unfair trade practice falling within the mischief of the said item and that it should desist from doing so in future.	Facts
The Company was directed to implement the modified Award in relation to the grant of stagnation increment and to work out the benefit on the wage scales existing on the date of the reference and pay the monthly benefits unconditionally to the retired workmen or those who had left the service of the Company in the meantime with interest at 12 per annum of the arrears.	Facts
It is against this order of the Tribunal that the Company has approached this Court directly by way of Special Leave Petition Nos. 13327 and 13339 of 1990.	Facts
Once this Court vacated the interim stay in regard to the implementation of the modified Award while granting leave to appeal, one fails to understand how the Company can refuse to implement the Award for the grant of stagnation increment.	Facts
To do so would be to refuse to comply with the High Courts order in regard to which this Court refused to continue the interim stay.	Facts
Therefore the Tribunal was justified in directing the Company to implement the modified Award relating to the grant of stagnation increment and to work out the benefit on the existing wagestructure.	Facts
We, therefore, do not work out any merit in these two special leave petitions and summarily dismiss the same.	Facts
From the resume of the facts it is evident that as a sequel to the Notice of Change given by the Company under Section9A of I. D. Act for placement of a ceiling in regard to the grant of dearness allowance, the clerical and technical workmen belonging to the C1 to C4 and T1 to T4 categories working at Sewree factory and at the head office raised certain demands for the revision of wages and grant of various allowances.	None
Since the Company had a slab system dearness allowance formula linked to basic wage and CPI, the Tribunal imposed a ceiling by providing that the workmen drawing a basic wage exceeding Rs. 500 per month shall be paid the same amount by way of dearness allowance as admissible to workmen drawing a basic wage of Rs. 500 on every rise of 10 points in the CPI.	None
In taking that view the Tribunal acted on the regioncumindustry basis and noticed that while other similarly situate industries in the region paid dearness allowance calculated at 1.25 on the third Rs. 100 and above the company paid as high as 2 which exceeded the neutralisation of 86 normally granted at the highest level of the salary structure.	None
It rejected the Companys extreme contention that the neutralisation factor exceeded 100 as well as the Unions contention that it did not exceed 80 vide paragraph 33 of the Tribunals (Dongre Award).	None
It also found as a matter of fact that the total emoluments of C4 and T4 employees exceed that received by Supervisors and Junior Executives by Rs. 400 to Rs. 600 per month.	None
Taking note of the fact that 100 neutralisation is ordinarily allowed to the lowest paid staff and as the basic salary rises the percentage of neutralisation slides down, the Tribunal felt that the neutralisation factor was very high at the higher levels of salary and even at the highest and, therefore, it opted in favour of imposing a ceiling to balance the wagestructure.	None
Since it imposed a ceiling on dearness allowance it rules in favour of an upward revision in the wagestructure.	Facts
The Tribunal also granted certain allowances, including gratuity, with which we are not concerned.	None
However, the learned Single Judge in the High Court while affirming the Tribunals decision concluded that the neutralisation rose to 100 at the higher levels of salary since the percentage fixed for VDA was very high as compared to other companies.	None
In taking the said view the learned Judge placed reliance on the decision reported in Chotanagpur Chamber of Commerce Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industries v. State of Bihar distinguishing the ratio laid down in Monthly Rated Workmen at the Wadala Factory of the Indian Hume Pipe Co. Ltd. v. Indian Hume Pipe Co. Ltd., Bombay.	None
The Division Bench of the High Court, as pointed out earlier, came to a definite conclusion that the neutralisation did not exceed 100 in any of the categories of the workmen concerned.	None
The Division Bench considered three methods, A, B and C, and opted for method B. Method A was canvassed by the management, method B by the workmen and method C was advocated by the Boothalingam Committee (1978).	None
These have been explained in paragraph 15 of the judgment.	None
The Division Bench rejects method A on the ground that it fails to achieve the main objective of protecting the real value of the basic wage.	None
It points out that if the dearness allowance is to serve the real objective, the rate at which it is paid must constantly reflect the basic wage which it seeks to protect.	None
As regards method B the Division Bench holds that it largely achieves the objective since it avoids the drawback of method A and constantly protects the value of the basic wage.	None
Not that it does not have its drawbacks but on the whole it was found to be attractive.	None
Method C though projected by the workmen was not seriously pressed.	None
Before the Division Bench the Company tries to make goods its contention by calculating the neutralisation as under TABLE I GradeBasicD.A.Total Basic D.A.1989 Total wageTotal Neutralisa 1970 1970wage 1989 CPI 3912 Packet in wage tion under the CPI Packet at 100 1989 at Packet existing 800 in neutralisa100 under system 1970 tion neutrali the (CPI 800) sation existing (CPI 3912)system 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 C1 Min. 130 351 481 130 1716 1846 2252 121.93 Max. 385 672 1057 385 3286 3671 4473 121.84 C2 Min. 175 413 588 175 2020 2195 2675 121.86 Max.

This different is on account of the fact that the Company has worked out the neutralisation by employing method A whereas the workmen have relied on method B.	None
Since method B commended itself to the Division Bench it concluded that the neutralisation did not exceed 100 and, therefore, rejected the Companys contention in that behalf.	None
The concept of dearness allowance, the second most important element in a workers wageplan next to the basic wage, was introduced during the Second World War to meet the increase in the cost of living caused by inflation.	None
It was either linked to the cost of living index or was given by way of flat increases.	None
When linked to the former, it was granted to all the income groups at a flat rate or was graded on a scale admissible to different income groups diminishing with rise in income.	None
Basically, the concept of dearness allowance was designed to combat inflation and protect real wages and therefore it would appear that there should be cent per cent neutralisation.	None
This is a concept peculiar to India, Ceylon, Pakistan and Bangladesh.	None
The National Commissioner on Labour (1969) recommended 95 neutralisation for minimum wage earners but it was reluctant to recommend the same rate for workers in higher wage groups for fear that it may spark of inflationary trends.	None
Normally such a dearness allowance formula suffers from two drawbacks, (i) it has the pernicious effect of distorting the wagestructure and (ii) it results in a sharp erosion of real income, particularly of those in the higher wage groups.	None
Generally speaking, the distortion of the wagestructure takes place because employees in different pay scales are granted dearness allowance not at a uniform rate but at a tapering rate, i. e., the workers in the lower scales getting a higher neutralisation compared to those in the higher paybrackets in whose case the neutralisation percentage diminishes with the rise in basic wage.	None
That is because it is believed that those in the higher paybrackets have a cushion to absorb the brunt of inflation.	None
The Companys case, therefore, is that as a concomitant to the tapering neutralisation system built into the extant formula, the maximum limit of the quantum of dearness allowance at a certain point in the paystructure was imperative to maintain certain differentials in the paypackets of employees so that the lower level employees do not draw emoluments equal to or almost equal to those in the officers scales.	None
The Company therefore contends that the Tribunal as well as the learned Single Judge had rightly appreciated the need for exercising control by imposition of a ceiling at the appropriate salary level to ensure that the neutralisation does not exceed 100 and the wagedifferentials are not so distorted as to make promotion to officers level unattractive.	None
The contention urged on behalf of the Company before the Tribunal was that the dearness allowance formula based on the slab system is so unrealistic that the employees of the Company constitute a privileged class, in that, their total emoluments have risen to disproportionately high levels as compared to their counterparts in similar other industries in the same region, thereby posing a threat to industrial peace inVi the region.	None
Dealing with the Companys case on the question of the percentage of neutralisation the Tribunal points out that the existing dearness allowance formula had been in vogue for many years preceding 1976 when the Company gave a Notice of Change under Section9A of the I. D. Act, and the neutralisation varied from 97.4 at the lowest level to 86 at the highest point.	None
It, however, felt that the percentage of neutralisation at the highest level was considerably higher than that granted to similarly situated employees in other comparable units.	None
According to the Tribunal the neutralisation for higher pay scales of Rs. 450 or Rs. 500 p. m. and above is higher and that was thought to be enough justification for placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance.	Facts
But at the same time the Tribunal conceded that there was no company of the size of the appellantCompany in the region, not even Godrej, Tata Oil Mills Company Ltd. (TOMCO) or Lakme for that matter.	None
In the absence of a comparable unit in the region, the Tribunal felt that they could be treated as somewhat comparable as they manufactured some of the goods manufactured by the appellantCompany.	None
The Tribunal noticed that in these units the variation percentage above the basic wage of Rs. 300 was very low.	None
It was found that while the variation percentage above Rs. 300 was as low as 1 1/4 in Godrej, TOMCO, Colgate and other similar units, it was as high as 2 in the appellantCompany.	None
The dearness allowance variation was noticed as under Pay H.L.L. TOMCO Godrej Colgate 300 Rs. 9.25 Rs. 8.75 Rs. 8.25 Rs. 8.00 400 Rs. 11.25 Rs. 10.00 Rs. 9.25 Rs. 9.00 500 Rs. 13.25 Rs. 11.25 Rs. 10.25 Rs. 10.00 600 Rs. 15.25 Rs. 12.50 Rs. 11.25 Rs. 11.00 700 Rs. 17.25 Rs. 13.75 Rs. 12.25 Rs. 12.00 From the above table the Tribunal held that the high variation percentage in the scheme of the appellantCompany above the basic wage of Rs. 300, caused a marked difference in the total carryhome paypacket of its employees visavis the employees of other comparable units resulting in a distortion in the wagestructure in the said region.	None
The Tribunal then noticed the reports of certain bodies, the Boothalingam Committee, the National Commission on Labour, the Central Pay Commissions, etc., and concluded that placement of a ceiling was imperative to ensure that the wagestructure does not get distorted and the disparity ratio between the wages paid by the appellantCompany and the wages paid by other comparable units in the region at the level of employees drawing a basic salary of Rs. 500 and above remains within reasonable bounds.	None
Against the Award of the Tribunal (Dongre Award) both the Sabha and the Union as well as the Company preferred writ petitions under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution which were numbered as Writ Petition Nos. 864, 865 and 1224 of 1986 respectively.	None
They were heard together by a learned Single Judge of the High Court.	None
The learned Single Judge, after coming to the conclusion that it was permissible for the Tribunal to fix a ceiling on dearness allowance admissible to workmen, found that the neutralisation at the higher level of basic wage of Rs. 500 and above exceeded 100.	None
He also found as a fact that the total emoluments to which workmen would be entitled under the extant dearness allowance formula far exceeded the emoluments drawn by Junior Executives of the Company.	None
Since the posts of Junior Executives are promotional posts for C3 and C4 and T3 and T4 categories, experience had shown that these workmen were unwilling to accept promotions resulting in indiscipline which caused an adverse effect on the Companys administration.	None
After referring to the case law in this behalf the learned Judge concluded as under In our case the imposition of ceiling on dearness allowance has not been effected merely on the ground that the senior workers may be earning more than the junior officers.	None
The entire wagepackage including additional benefits given under the award along with the fact that despite the imposition of ceiling there is more than 100 neutralisation are all taken into account while imposing the ceiling.	None
Hence the finding of the Tribunal on this issue cannot be faulted.	None
The learned Judge while noting that the placement of the ceiling will cause disparity in the wagedifferential between C and T grades inter se observed that that would be a necessary consequence of the ceiling but merely on that account it may not be correct to refuse to place a ceiling as in the higher slabs of wages the differentials must be reduced.	None
In this view of the matter the award of the Tribunal in this behalf was sustained.	None
As stated earlier, appeals were preferred against the decision of the learned Single Judge, being Appeal Nos. 1606 and 1607 of 1988 by the Sabha and the Union, respectively, and Appeal No. 151 of 1989 by the Company against the grant of the stagnation increment etc.	None
The view taken by the Division Bench has been indicated hereinbefore and we need not restate it.	None
It is in the above background that we must consider the question of placement of a ceiling on dearness allowance.	Issue
As is so wellknown, wages are among the major factors in the economic and social life of the working classes.	None
Workers and their families depend almost entirely on wages to provide themselves with the three basic requirements of food, clothing and shelter.	None
The other necessities of life like childrens education, medical expenses, etc., must also come out of the emoluments earned by the breadwinner.	None
Workers are therefore concerned with the purchasing power of the paypacket they receive for their toil.	None
If the rise in the paypacket does not keep pace with the rise in prices of essentials the purchasing power of the paypacket falls reducing the real wages leaving the workers and their families worse off.	None
Therefore, if on account of inflation prices rise while the paypacket remains frozen, real wages will fall sharply.	None
This is what happens in periods of inflation.	None
In order to prevent such a fall in real wages different methods are adopted to provide for the rise in prices.	None
In the costofliving sliding scale systems the basic wages are automatically adjusted to price changes shown by the costofliving index.	None
In this way the purchasing power of workers wages is maintained to the extent possible and necessary.	None
However, leapfrogging must be avoided.	None
This Court in Clerks Depot Cashiers of Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd. v. Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd., held that while awarded dearness allowance cent per cent neutralisation of the price of cost of living should be avoided to check inflationary trends.	None
That is why in Hindustan Times Ltd. v. Workmen Das Gupta, J. observed that the whole purpose of granting dearness allowance to workmen being to neutralise the portion of the increase in the cost of living, it should ordinarily be on a sliding scale and provide for an increase when the cost of living increases and a decrease when it falls.	None
The same principle was reiterated in Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Workmen and Shri Chalthan Vibhag Khand Udyog Sahakari Mandli Ltd. v. G. S. Barot, Member, Industrial Court, Gujarat and it was emphasised that normally full neutralisation is not given except to the lowest class of employees and that too on a sliding scale.	None
To the lowest paid employees who are near about the subsistence level, full neutralisation or thereabouts would be justified.	None
It was, therefore, emphasised by the learned counsel for the Company that in no case can the neutralisation exceed cent per cent, since the purpose of granting dearness allowance is to enable the worker to tide over the rise in the cost of living so that it does not affect his purchasing power in relation to basic necessities of life.	None
But it must be realised that even at the lowest level since neutralisation is related to basic requirements of food, clothing and shelter, several other requirements remain unattended and workmen have to bear the brunt of the price rise to satisfy such needs.	None
At higher levels also because of the tapering neutralisation allowed employees suffer a sharp fall in their real earnings over a period of time.	None
Besides, the food basket which constitutes the major item in the kitty of basic necessities on which neutralisation is determined, differs at different levels and keeps changing with the passage of time even for employees of the lowest level with the result that the new items remain outside the admissible items for neutralisation.	None
All these factors contribute to the distortion in the real wages of the workmen.	None
As a concomitant to the tapering neutralisation system, maximum limits of the quantum of dearness allowance at different pay belts is often insisted upon so that lower level employees do not draw more.	None
But as against that the countereffect of the tapering or sliding neutralisation system with fixed maxima at different levels is that it completely distorts the paystructure and erodes the real value of the wages.	None
To overcome such an effect on the paystructure the Third Central Pay Commission had stipulated that should the price level rise above the 12 monthly average of 272 (1960100) points, the position should be reviewed to remove the ceiling of Rs. 2, 400 p. m. That is shy in Kamani Metals Alloys Ltd. v. Workmen, Hidayatullah, J. remarked that the dearness allowance given to compensate the cost of living being less than the cent per cent increase ceases to make up for the ever widening gap between wages and cost of living and an upward revision of wages or dearness allowance becomes imperative.	None
In Killick Nixon Ltd. v. Killick Allied Companies Employees Union, the Company gave a Notice of Change on 1151966 for placing a ceiling on dearness allowance already in vogue at the figure of Rs. 325 on account of the steep rise in dearness allowance linked with the costofliving index in Bombay.	None
The workmen resisted the same and by consent reference was made in June 1966 to the Industrial Tribunal which removed the ceiling.	None
The award was challenged in this Court.	None
The employers contended that the scheme of dearness allowance linked to the costofliving index as well as to the basic wage by way of slabs necessitated a ceiling for otherwise it ceased to be compensation for rise in cost of living but in fact amounted to additional remuneration not related to the rise in the cost of living.	None
The stand of the employees was that there should be no ceiling on dearness allowance till the level of living wage was achieved.	None
In the Bombay region, it was pointed out that there were a number of concerns having a slab system of dearness allowance without a ceiling and there were others with a ceiling as well.	None
Taking note of the ceiling applicable in the case of Central Government employees, this Court observed that imposition of ceiling was not a totally alien phenomenon, though it could not be said to be a generally prevalent practice.	None
The Court rejected the idea of imposition of ceiling at the lowest level but observed that the removal of ceiling on dearness allowance would not be justified, even though the Company was prosperous and consumer price index was soaring, because (i) the rise in CPI produces a steep rise in dearness allowance (ii) the absence of a ceiling may result in clerical staff getting more than junior executives and (iii) a general problem such as this cannot be treated on a statistical burden relating to only 265 of 1142 workmen.	None
This Court held that those at the subsistence level would be entitled to 100 neutralisation without a ceiling but for those in higher slabs, the Tribunal was required to consider, having regard to principles laid down therein, at what level the ceiling should be imposed.	None
Considerable reliance was placed on this decision.	None
However, we may take note of the recent decision of this Court in Workmen v. Reptakos Brett.	None
Co. Ltd.	None
In that case, the Company first introduced the slab system of dearness allowance in 1959 which was liberalised in 1964 by the addition of VDA with a limit, which limit was later removed in 1969.	None
Thereafter, when the Company attempted to restructure the scheme on the plea that the slab system had resulted in overneutralisation thereby placing the workmen in the high wage island, the same was resisted by the workmen on the plea that what they were paid was not even needbased wage.	None
The Tribunal upheld the Companys plea for placing a ceiling on dearness allowance but this Court disapproved of the same on the ground that there was nothing on record to show that what was paid was higher than what would be required to be paid on the concept of needbased wage.	None
This Court conceded that the Company can revise the wagestructure to the prejudice of its workmen in certain situations, e. g., financial stringency, etc., but held that no such revision can be permitted if the wagestructure is at the minimumwage level.	None
This decision was pressed into service by counsel for the workers before us to buttress his submission that merely because the total emoluments drawn by the workers of the appellantCompany compare favourably with that paid to workers of TOMCO, Godrej, Colgate, etc., that by itself is not sufficient reason to slice down the emoluments of the former by placing a ceiling on dearness allowance at Rs. 500 and above wage level.	None
From the above discussion it clearly emerges that the appellantCompany is a big industrial establishment and there is no other similar establishment of that size in that region.	None
The volume of business of the appellantCompany is many many time more than companies like Godrej, TOMCO, Philips, Colgate, etc., which have been treated as comparable units in the absence of a really comparable unit in that area.	None
The other units though tiny in size and with a low a volume of business as compared to the appellantCompany were treated as comparable only because they manufactured some of the items manufactured by the latter.	None
Otherwise, truly they are not comparable.	None
Secondly, the appellantCompany is financially sound and there is no dispute, indeed none was raised at any stage of the present proceedings, that it is in a position to absorb any additional financial burden that may be thrown on it if all the demands made by the employees are conceded.	None
Thirdly, the extant dearness allowance scheme has been in vogue since long before the Company gave the Notice of Change.	None
Ordinarily, when the workers are enjoying the benefit under a scheme without a ceiling the Tribunal or the Court would be slow to interfere with the scheme unless compelling reasons are shown.	None
Fourthly, there is no dispute that the salary structure must be costeffective and merely because the Company is financially sound and in a position to absorb the additional burden is no ground to revise the emoluments upward.	None
There can be no doubt that no industrial establishment can be expected to show such financial indulgence or indiscipline as would distort the existing differentials, etc., merely because its financial condition is sound enough to absorb additional financial burdens.	None
That is for the obvious reason that irresponsible and unjustified upward revision of wages would create ripples elsewhere and disturb the wagestructure in the region.	None
However, it must be realised that under Article 43 of the Constitution the ultimate goal or objective is to secure a living wage and therefore, contends the learned counsel for the workers, till that goal is reached, the Court should refuse to interfere in such cases.	None
It was, therefore, strongly urged by the learned counsel for the workers that this Court should not interfere in exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction.	None
Lastly, it was said that the passage of time also would justify noninterference.	None
On behalf of the appellant it was contended that the Division Bench exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with the concurrent decisions of the Tribunal (Dongre Award) and the learned Single Judge based on appreciation of evidence on record and in particular with the decision of the latter who held that under the prevailing formula the neutralisation exceeded 100 leading to a distortion in the wagestructure.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that the Tribunal committed an error in holding that the neutralisation varied between 94.4 at the lowest level and 86 at the highest level and the learned Single Judge was, therefore, right in correcting the error and in recording a finding that the existing formula provided for neutralisation which at certain levels exceeded 100.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further pointed out that notwithstanding the above error in working out the neutralisation percentage, the Tribunal rightly held in paragraphs 36 and 37 of its Award that since under the existing scheme employees in paybrackets of basic Rs. 500 and above were entitled to VDA at 2 flat for every 10 points rise in the CPI, the dearness allowance payable to them was excessive compared to 1 to 1 1/4 admissible to workers in comparable units and hence a ceiling at Rs. 500 and above was imperative to ensure that the wagedifferentials were not distorted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Contended counsel that this finding of the Tribunal was rightly affirmed by the learned Single Judge following the decision of this Court in Killick Nixon Ltd. distinguishing Hume Pipe Co. case on facts.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel submitted that this concurrent view ought not to have been disturbed by the Division Bench on the totally erroneous premise that dearness allowance was meant to compensate the change in cost of living when it was fairly well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court that it was meant to protect the purchasing power of the employees in respect of the items constituting the basket of essential commodities and not to compensate for rise in prices of nonessentials.	Arguments of Petitioner
Proceeding on yet another erroneous basis that the neutralisation formula can vary depending on the purpose to which it is applied, counsel contended that the entire approach of the Division Bench was misconceived and the confusion created thereby is worst confounded by the assumption that the parties consented to 1970 being the base year, when it was not so, and in relying on the tables reproduced earlier prepared on that base year.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that the tables were constructed taking 1970 as the base year as that was the desire of the learned Judge constituting the Division Bench but that was never conceded as acceptable by the management.	Arguments of Petitioner
Lastly, it was said that the decision of the Division Bench runs counter to the wellrecognised regioncumindustry principle.	Arguments of Petitioner
On behalf of the employees, counsel submitted, that even if it is assumed that the material on record indicated that the emoluments paid to the workers were much higher than the subsistence level, they were indisputably far below the living wage promised by Article 43 of the Constitution and hence there was no justification to put a ceiling on dearness allowance.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that as rightly held by the Division Bench there is in fact no overneutralisation and no distortion in the emoluments drawn by workers and executive officers, and, therefore, on regioncumindustry basis also the plea for placement of a ceiling on VDA in the higher paybracket of Rs. 500 and above is not justified.	Arguments of Respondent
It is pointed out that the prevailing slabsystem dearness allowance scheme is related to 180 points (1934100) and therefore up to that level no dearness allowance is admissible to workers.	Arguments of Respondent
It is only after that level that dearness allowance become payable on the cycle of 10 points rise.	Arguments of Respondent
This formula which has been in vogue since long does not permit cent per cent neutralisation even at the lowest level of basic pay not exceeding Rs. 100 per month.	Arguments of Respondent
This works out to a variation of 5 at the lowest level and that tapers down 2.25 and 2 for the second and the third Rs. 100 rise which reduces the neutralisation much below 90.	Arguments of Respondent
That is why the Dongre Award also conceded that the neutralisation does not exceed 100 at any level of the wagestructure.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further pointed out that there has been no merger of dearness allowance in basic wage since the scheme was introduced in 1952 and hence the workers have suffered and if the dearness allowance is frozen as per the Tribunals award it would be most unjust to the workers.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further pointed out that there had been no upward revision of the basic wage since 1972.	Arguments of Respondent
Insofar as the vertical relativity in the wages of workers and officers just above the workers is concerned, it is contended that workers and officers are not comparable, the former are covered under the I. D. Act while the latter are not, the wagestructure of the former is determined by hard bargaining which is not the case with the latter and hence the comparison is wholly misplaced.	Arguments of Respondent
Besides the benefits which officers derive under the terms and conditions applicable to them offsets the apparent, though not real, difference, if at all, in the emoluments.	Arguments of Respondent
Lastly, it was said that if any such distortion in the differential troubles the Company, the same can be corrected by revising the salary structure of the officers but there would be no justification to control it by placing in ceiling on the dearness allowance admissible to the workers under the extant scheme.	Arguments of Respondent
We may first answer the contention whether the Division Bench acted without jurisdiction and contrary to wellestablished principles for the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution in reversing the decision of the Tribunal as well as the learned Single Judge placing a ceiling on dearness allowance at the level of basic pay of Rs. 500 per month and above.	Issue
It must be remembered that the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal under the I. D. Act was invoked both by the management as well as the workers.	Reasoning
It is well settled that the decision of the Tribunal rendered under the I. D. Act would be subject to review by the High Court under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Since against the decision of the Industrial Tribunal no remedy was available under the provisions of the I. D. Act, the aggrieved party could only invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court under the aforesaid articles.	Reasoning
Since both the Company and the workers were aggrieved by the award, to the extent it went against them, they preferred writ petitions challenging the award.	Reasoning
All the three writ petitions, two on behalf of the workers by the Sabha and the Union, the third by the Company, were heard together and disposed of by a common judgment.	Reasoning
Against the decision of the learned Single Judge, appeals under the Letters Patent were preferred once again by the said three parties.	Reasoning
The Company never questioned the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear and decide the writ petitions nor did it question the jurisdiction of the Division Bench under the Letters Patent.	Reasoning
Even the Company had appealed against the learned Single Judges decision to the extent it was against it.	Reasoning
No contention regarding the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the Division Bench was raised in the appeal.	Reasoning
If the jurisdiction of the learned Single Judge was not challenged by the Company, the Company itself had invoked it, it is difficult to comprehend how the Company can challenge the jurisdiction of the appellate court.	Reasoning
If the learned Single Judge had jurisdiction to hear the writ petitions against the decision of the Industrial Tribunal, at any rate if his jurisdiction was not questioned by the Company, it cannot lie in the mouth of the Company to challenge the appellate jurisdiction of the Division Bench since that jurisdiction is conferred by the Letters Patent.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, of the view that this contention belatedly raised before us cannot and should not be entertained.	Reasoning
We reject it.20.	Reasoning
We now come to the main issue.	Reasoning
We have indicated in detail the nature, scope and ambit of the controversy.	Reasoning
The contesting parties have updated the tables on which they relied before the Tribunal and the High Court and have also presented fresh calculations  the Company endeavouring to show that the percentage of neutralisation soars above 100 and hence the need to impose a ceiling so that the existing differentials between the emoluments drawn by the workers in the higher paybrackets do not exceed those drawn by the junior executives immediately above them the workers on the other hand refuting the contention that there is overneutralisation and the need to impose a ceiling.	Reasoning
In fact an attempt has been made to point out that those in the higher paybrackets are scientists and sectionheads doing highly skilled work and it is wrong to think that they are in any manner inferior to junior executives.	Reasoning
The workers have tried to emphasise that as the record stands it is not possible to say whether the wagestructure is at the subsistence level, needbased level, fairwage level or livingwage level to enable this Court to decide whether or not a case for imposition of ceiling is made out.	Reasoning
It is also contended that the Company has tried, time and again, to cloud the facts and has falsely alleged that the 1970 base was not adopted by consent.	Reasoning
Since that was the year in which the last revision had taken place under the Chitale Bhojwani Awards, 1970 was taken as the base year by consent.	Reasoning
It is, therefore, contended by the workers that the Company has tried to shift its stand from stage to stage of the litigation to suit its purpose in the fond hope that it may be able to persuade this court to its point of view.	Reasoning
The respondents, therefore, have requested us not to look into these revised and misleading statements.21.	Reasoning
We have, however, carefully examined the various statements placed on record to prove the rival points of view.	Reasoning
The principal question is whether the Companys case of overneutralisation is wellfounded and, if yes, whether there is need to impose a ceiling on dearness allowance as advocated by the Tribunal and affirmed by the learned Single Judge.	Reasoning
Now it is established that the present dearness allowance formula has been in vogue since long.	Reasoning
It is also not in dispute that after the Chitale Bhojwani Awards the Company had entered into settlements in 1979 and 1983 with the subclerical and hourlyrated employees in the Sewree factory and continued the existing formula.	Reasoning
Before the Tribunal the Company produced statements to show that the neutralisation was as high as 204 at the minimum of C1 grade tapering to 132.4 at the maximum of C4 grade.	Reasoning
As against that the workers contended that the percentage of neutralisation was 80 and 46, respectively.	Reasoning
The Tribunal held that the calculations made by both sides were incorrect.	Reasoning
Referring to the Chitale Award the Tribunal points out that the Companys own statement showed that the neutralisation was 97.4 at the lowest and tapered to 86 at the highest.	Reasoning
It, however, felt that 86 neutralisation was on the higher side.	Reasoning
It was for this reason that the Tribunal opted for placement of a ceiling.	Reasoning
However, the Tribunal did not determine the percentage of neutralisation on the basis of calculations submitted to it.	Reasoning
The learned Single Judge in the High Court, however, placed reliance on the following statement Wages of Oct. 85 Wages Wages Wages Wages age age as at CLI 2886 pay as pay onpay as pay on rise in rise in age (without revised per Impl.ofper Impl.ofInd.	None

None
This calculation was based on the Chotanagpur Chamber of Commerce case method.	None
The calculation statement placed by the Company before the Division Bench showed that the neutralisation was as high as 121 or thereabouts.	None
The statement produced before this Court shows the neutralisation varying between 133 at the minimum level and 125 at the maximum level.	None
The Company has also produced a statement showing the total emoluments drawn by C3 and C4 category workers visavis junior executives and T3 and T4 category employees visavis JDS and SDS (executives).	None
It shows at when the CPI stood at 6229 points, C3 received Rs. 10, 908 and C4 Rs. 12, 006 whereas junior executives officers, such as, Sales Accounting Officer Law Officer Export Officer drew Rs. 8492.	None
Similarly T3 category received Rs. 12, 168 and T4 Rs. 13, 677 as against JDS getting Rs. 8043 and SDS getting Rs. 9242.	None
This was to bring out the disparity in earnings between the earnings of workers in wage brackets as against those of the executives of the Company.	None
We may say that the statements produced by both the sides have not helped us in clearing the queer pitch.	None
Let us first understand the Companys dearness allowances scheme.	None
It is in two parts.	None
Under the scheme FDA was linked to costofliving index 1450, CPI (Bombay), (1934100) whereunder dearness allowance was admissible as under For the FIRST 635 of Basic Wage Rs. 100 (ii) For the SECOND 284.25 of Basic Wage Rs. 100 (iii) For Salaries 251 of Basic Wage.	None
above Rs. 200 On the CPI rising above 1450 points, VDA for every 10 points rise became admissible as under For the FIRST 5 of Basic Wage Rs. 100 (ii) For the SECOND 2.25 of Basic Wage Rs. 100 (iii) For salaries 2 of Basic Wage.	Facts
above Rs. 200 It immediately strikes one that the dearness allowance is payable uniformly to all the workers and although it may at first blush appear to be on a sliding scale, in actual application it is not so and hence it is not likely to disturb the internal differentials between the workers covered by the scheme.	None
That is because all the workers regardless of their basic salaries would be paid uniformly, in the sense, that all the workers would be paid at 635 of basic wage for the first rupees, at 284.25 for the next hundred rupees and above Rs. 200 at the rate of 251.	None
So also in the case of VDA.	None
Now these percentages were worked out long back on the basis of the neutralisation to be allowed to the workers in different salary groups.	None
It is nobodys case that when the scheme was introduced the Company had permitted itself the indulgence of conceding more than cent per cent neutralisation to its employees.	None
It is, therefore, difficult to assume that when the scheme was introduced workers belonging to any wage group were allowed more than 100 neutralisation.	None
Nor is it the Companys case that the dearness allowance initially agreed upon exceeded 100 at any level even if FDA and VDA were taken together.	None
In fact as per the table supplied by the Company, no VDA was paid up to 180 points rise, as is evident from the following extract Bombay Upto and Up to and On the balance Working including including of Basic Salary Class Rs. 100 basic Rs. 101200 CPI salary basic salary 105180 NIL NIL NIL 181190 5 75 NIL 191200 10 3.00 1 200210 15 5.25 3 Variation 5 2.25 2 It would seem extremely doubtful that the Company would agree to pay FDA and VDA at a rate higher than the percentage required to neutralise the impact of price rise as reflected by the CPI.	None
Therefore, on first principles it would seem that the Companys case of the neutralisation exceeding 100 does not seem to be correct.	None
We are, therefore, inclined to think that the Tribunal was right in concluding that the neutralisation varied from 97.4 to 86.	None
The learned Single Judge in the High Court committed an error in setting aside the said finding in upholding the Companys contention in this behalf.	None
The Division Bench, as an appellate forum, was justified in correcting the error by pointing out that it had crept in because the method adopted by the Company in calculating the neutralisation percentage was wrong and that the error which would disappear if the correct method B is employed.	None
The second ground on which the Company sought imposition of control or ceiling on dearness allowance is that it distorts the vertical relativity, in that, clerks receive emoluments exceeding what is paid to junior executives and are, therefore, disinclined to accept promotion.	Reasoning
Since the basic pay of the workers belonging to the C1 to C4 and T1 to T4 categories is low they continue to be governed by the provisions of the I. D. Act whereas the junior executives are not governed by the said statute.	Reasoning
The wages of the former would be determined either by settlements or by award made on reference under the said statute.	Reasoning
These workers, therefore, constitute a class by themselves and their wage determination is under the provisions of the I. D. Act.	Reasoning
But the junior executives do not belong to that class and their salaries are differently determined.	Reasoning
The process of determination of their salary plan has nothing to do with the workers governed by the I. D. Act.	Reasoning
How to make the promotional post attractive is for the company to decide but it may not be by denying the workers of a part of their dearness allowance for pegging down their emoluments.	Reasoning
Besides it is well known that executives enjoy a certain status and perquisites which the workers do not receive.	Reasoning
We think the better way to overcome the difficulty is make the junior executive grade more attractive rather than deny to the workers what they are receiving since long.24.	Reasoning
Next, we have pointed out earlier the relation between wages and prices of food, clothing and other necessities of life which even the lowest wage earner purchases month after month.	Reasoning
If the prices of these commodities rise and the basic wage remains constant, real wage actually falls creating a problem for survival for the lowest wage earner.	Reasoning
And it is common knowledge that this frequently happens during period of inflation as is reflected from how rapidly the index rose from 313 points in 1950 to 6229 points by August 1993.	Reasoning
To prevent the real wages from falling with the rise in CPI, some allowance had to be paid to the workers which gave rise to the introduction of the dearness allowances scheme.	Reasoning
Besides, it must be realised that the protection against price rise is limited to only those items included in the basket and not to all items which a wage earner at the lowest level consumes.	Reasoning
For those items not included in the basket, the wage earner at every level has to bear the brunt of inflation.	Reasoning
It must also be remembered that while dietary habits change, the food items in the basket remain constant for want of periodical revision with the result that the new items of food which are highly price do not count for neutralisation.	Reasoning
Again wage revisions do not take place for long spells.	Reasoning
In certain wage plans upward revision of wages take place by the merger of a portion of the dearness allowance in the basic wage plus an addition thereto to take care of the inflationary dents in the wagestructure in respect of other items outside the basket.	Reasoning
Under certain dearness allowance schemes, neutralisation is allowed on tapering percentages on the assumption that those in the higher wage groups have a certain cushion to bear a part of the inflation.	Reasoning
Such a scheme is in vogue in Central and State Government servants salary plans.	Reasoning
That cushion does not remain static and gets depleted as the prices rise and there comes a time when it becomes necessary to inflate it once again by an upward revision of the salary structure.	Reasoning
But in certain industries merger of dearness allowance in the basic wage does not take place at all as in the present case and instead periodically increases are allowed in the basic wage to nullify the adverse effect of inflation on items outside the basket.	Reasoning
It must, however, be remembered that in the case of employees belonging to high wage islands, their carryhomepaypackets shrink on account of the deduction of incometax at source.	None

It may be mentioned that the scales fixed under the Chitale Award were revised by the Bhojwani Award by raising the maxima only without altering the minima and the annual increments.	None
The preDongre Scales are the Bhojwani Scales fixed in 1977 when the CPI was at 1400 points.	None
Since then there was no revision.	None
It will be seen from the above table that except in C1C2 and T1T2 categories for which the Dongre Award raised the minimum, retaining the annual increments at the same figures, at the same figures, in the other categories the minimum as well as the annual increments remained unchanged giving no benefit to those at the minimum of the scales.	None
Under the Dongre scheme the maxima were raised upwards	None
but since there was no increase in the increments, the real effect was mere elongation of the scales.	None
To the C1C2 and T1T2 categories while the Dongre Award granted one increment at the minimum of the scale, Deshpande wageplan has given two or more increments at the starting point while retaining the annual increments at the same level.	None
In the C1C2 category the maxima is marginally marginally revised in that, in the C1, C3 and C4 categories the maxima is slightly reduced whereas in the C2 category it is slightly increased.	None
The annual increments have not been revised in C1 to C4 categories, but that is not the case with T1 to T4 categories.	None
In the T1T2 categories the scale has been substantial revised upwards both at the minima and the maxima but in the T3T4 categories while the minima has been slightly raised, at the maxima there is a slight reduction.	None
With the rise in annual increments in the technical categories, the span of scales stood reduced whereas in the clerical categories it stood enlarged.	None
It may also be mentioned that employees in the clerical cadres were required to work for 36 hours in a week unlike those belonging to the technical cadres who are required to work for 48 hours in a week.	None
That provides that justification for higher scales for the technical staff.	None
The Deshpande Tribunal could have revised the wagestructure on certain wellsettled principles for pay determination or on comparative method on regioncumindustry principle.	None
It chose to follow the latter course and considered the salary structures of TOMCO, Philips, etc., but placed considerable reliance on the wagestructure of TOMCO.	None
The Tribunal after considering the rival contentions concluded in paragraph 22 as under In my considered opinion, other benefits both of HLL Companys employees and TOMCO Companys employees, should not be taken into account, while considering the wage scales revision, what we have compared is wage scales only.	None
It is pertinent to note that this reference is remanded back to this Court only to consider the wage scales revisions, and there is no mention of other benefits, which are receivable by HLL employee or the employees of TOMCO or other company.	None
Therefore, in my considered opinion, while considering the wage scales revision, only wage scales and dearness allowance payable in HLL, TOMCO and Philips companies, should be considered, and other benefits receivable either by the employees of HLL or the employees of other comparable company, should not be considered.	None
It is obvious from the above observations that while determining the question of revision of pay scales, the Tribunal considered the basic salary and dearness allowance plans of other companies and not the total emoluments inclusive of all allowances.	None
The Tribunal then concluded in paragraph 26 as follows So far as the scales of revision wage scales is concerned, it is clear that it must be brought into pay with the wage scales of comparable concern i. e. TOMCO and in that respect statement furnished by Shri Menon, Advocate for the Union, appear to be correct.	None
Hence, I agree with a modified revision of wage scales, as demanded by the workmen.	None
The learned counsel for the Company took serious exception to the upward revision of the scales above those recommended by the Dongre Award.	None
His objection runs thus The workers were not aggrieved by the revised wagestructure granted under the Dongre Award and had stated so in no uncertain terms in their writ petitions in the High Court in the following words The petitioner says that the petitioner is not challenging the entirety of the Award, but is limiting the attack on the Award, insofar as it relates to (a) Dearness Allowances, (b) Classification, (c) Automatic Promotion and Stagnation Increment, (d) Housing Loan and (e) Provident Fund.	None
This averment is not denied.	None
It was the Company which had challenged the revised wagestructure prepared under the Dongre Award.	Reasoning
The learned Single Judge spurned the Companys challenge.	Reasoning
The Division Bench found it necessary to remit the matter to the Tribunal for reconsidering the question regarding revision of pay scales as in its view the Dongre Award had considered the revision necessary as a package formula since it had placed a control on dearness allowances, which control the Division Bench had lifted.	Reasoning
Counsel, therefore, vehemently contended that there was no question of a further upward revision beyond what was allowed under the Dongre Award.	Reasoning
Counsel submitted that the Deshpande Award whereunder higher pay scales have been granted is wholly unsustainable.	Reasoning
We see merit in this line of reasoning.33.	Reasoning
The learned Single Judge in paragraph 8 of his judgment points out that the Tribunal had while making the Award awarded a package deal to the workers and had allowed various other benefits since he had placed a ceiling on dearness allowance.	Reasoning
He has granted revision of pay scales, special allowances, etc.	Reasoning
However, in paragraph 11 there is a mention that counsel for the workers had raised the contention that the salary structure of TOMCO was higher, the entire wagepacket was in fact better, and since it was a comparable industrial unit the workers of the company were entitled to the same.	Reasoning
In fact the learned Single Judge notes that he had enquired of the management if it would be willing to grant the entire paypacket of TOMCO to the workers of the Company and the management after taking time showed its willingness to do so but the workers did not agree.	Reasoning
Thus although the learned Single Judge explored the possibility of the management giving the TOMCO paypacket to the workers of the Company when the workers backed out on second thought he did not interfere with the Dongre Award in that behalf in view of the aforesaid statement.34.	Reasoning
The Division Bench noticed the submission made on behalf of the Company in paragraph 46 of its judgment and conceded in paragraph 48 It cannot be gainsaid that one of the main considerations, which was weighed with the Tribunal, while introducing the revised pay scales is that it was introducing the ceiling on dearness allowance, for those earning salary above Rs. 500 per month, which accords with what counsel for the Company has urged.	Reasoning
It was on this consideration that the Division Bench concluded that both the revision of salary and introduction of the new dearness allowance system were interlinked and since the ceiling on the latter was lifted, the Division Bench considered it only fair to remand the matter to the Tribunal to consider the case for revision of wage scales afresh independently and irrespective of the change in the dearness allowance system which was proposed by it.	Reasoning
The observations of the Division Bench had to be understood in the backdrop of the fact that the workers were content with the revised pay scales worked out under the Dongre Award and had therefore not questioned that part of the award.	Reasoning
Since the learned Single Judge had not interfered with it, there was no question of their getting higher pay scales.	Reasoning
When the Division Bench remitted the matter in this background the Tribunal should have realised that the remand was necessitated because the factum of imposition of a ceiling on dearness allowance was the reason which had impelled the Tribunal to increase the pay scales and since the ceiling was lifted it was necessary to consider whether upward revision of the pay scales was at all necessary in the changed circumstances and, if yes, whether the revision ordered under the Dongre Award was justified.	Reasoning
There was no question of the pay scales being revised above the Dongre Award stipulations.	Reasoning
Besides, we are also not happy with the approach of the Tribunal.	Reasoning
It is not correct to say that the Division Bench had imposed any limitation of the type read by the Tribunal as evidenced by the recital in paragraph 22 of its order extracted earlier.	Reasoning
We also find that the Tribunal has merely set out the rival contentions and the data in support thereof and has, without analysing the same, concluded that the modified revision of pay scales suggested by the workers was justified.	Reasoning
This approach is far from satisfactory.	Reasoning
The need for stagnation increment would again depend on the time span in each scale in the revised paystructure.	None
If the length of the pay scale is sufficient not to result in stagnation there would be no need for stagnation increment.	Reasoning
We would, therefore, like the Tribunal to consider that question but if it comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to revise the pay scales and that the revised scales may cause some workers to stagnate at the maxima of the scale, it may opt in favour of the retention of the stagnation increase but if it does not see any scope for its retention it may for reasons to be stated to away with it.	Reasoning
In the result Civil Appeal Nos. 4848 to 4850 of 1989 challenging the order of the Division Bench are dismissed.	Decision
Civil Appeals arising from SLP (C) Nos. 1455889 of 1991 directed against the Deshpande Award are allowed and the said Award is set aside.	Decision
The issue whether in view of there being no ceiling on dearness allowance, there is any need for upward revision of the wages, and, if yes, whether up to the level of Dongre Award or less will have to be redetermined by the Tribunal on the existing material on record.	Decision
In doing so the Tribunal will also keep in view the level at which the present wagestructure stands, i. e., whether it is above the subsistence level and, if yes, whether it is at the needbased, fair wage or living wage level and then determine the question of revision of wages.	Decision
Since the dispute is pending since long, the Tribunal will decide the question on the material already on record after hearing oral submissions at an early date, preferably within six months from the date of receipt of this Courts order.	Decision
Consequently the civil appeals arising from SLP(C)	Decision
Nos. 13327 and 13339 of 1990 will stand allowed limited to the grant of stagnation increments on condition that the payments already made towards stagnation increments by the trust of the orders impugned herein will not be recalled and those who are allowed stagnation allowance will continue to receive the same till the Tribunal makes a fresh award.	Decision
In that sense the remand will operate prospectively only but will be subject to orders of the Tribunal from the date it makes a fresh award.	Decision
The equities, if any, will be adjusted by the Tribunal.	Decision
Since those who may become entitled to stagnation allowance hereafter will have to wait till the Tribunal makes it fresh award we do hope that the Tribunal will abide by the timelimit.36.	Decision
Having regard to the extent of success and failure, we make no order as to costs in all the aforesaid appeals.	Decision
