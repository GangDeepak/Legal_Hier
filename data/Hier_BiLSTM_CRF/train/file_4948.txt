As mentioned above, the appellant has challenged the decision of the Competent Authority of the Central Government communicated vide letter dated 31st May, 2017.	Facts
The decision was partly in favour of the appellant, confirming the renewal of permission granted for admitting students for the 5th batch in MBBS course for the academic session 201617 and also directing the MCI to return the bank guarantee of Rs. 2 crore given by the appellant college.	None
The latter part of the said decision, however, is adverse to the appellant, debarring the appellant college from admitting students in MBBS course (150 seats) for the academic session 201718.5.	None
The High Court vide order dated 19th July, 2017, which is impugned in this appeal, has issued notice to the respondents but refused to grant any interim relief to the appellant to allow them to admit students in MBBS course for the academic session 201718.	None
As a result, the appellant approached this Court by way of present special leave petition which was heard on 11th August, 2017.	None
On the basis of the arguments advanced by the parties, this Court directed the Central Government to reconsider the matter and accordingly, passed the following orderHeard Mr. Mukul Rohatgi and Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel, Mr. Gaurav Bhatia, learned counsel for the petitioners, Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned senior counsel for the Union of India and Mr. Gaurav Sharma, learned counsel for the Medical Council of India.	Facts
Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it is directed that the Central Government shall afford an opportunity of hearing to the representatives of the Institutions and take assistance of the newly constituted Committee as per the judgment passed by the Constitution Bench in Amma Chandravati Educational and Charitable Trust and Others v. Union of India and Another Writ Petition (C) No.408 of 2017, within ten days hence and pass a reasoned order by end of August, 2017.	Facts
Be it noted, we have passed this order as the order impugned is the communication by the Central Government which is dated 31st May,	Facts
2017.List the matter in the first week of September, 2017.6.	None
In view of the directions given by this Court, the Central Government considered the matter afresh and has passed a detailed order (running into 5 pages) on 31st August, 2017.	Facts
The relevant portion of the order is in paragraphs 16 17.	Facts
The rest of the paragraphs refer to the previous proceedings reckoned by the Ministry.	Facts
Paragraphs 16 17 of the said order read thus16.	Facts
Now, in compliance with the above direction of Honble Supreme Court dated 11.08.2017, the Ministry granted hearing to the college on 25.08.2017.	Facts
A member of the Oversight Committee was present during the entire proceeding of the Hearing Committee.	Facts
The Hearing Committee after considering the record and submission of the college submitted its report to the Ministry with the following conclusionThe Hearing Committee is of the view that the bed occupancy as claimed by the college cannot be validated by this Committee and requires physical verification.	Facts
A copy of the Hearing Committee report containing the above observation is enclosed.17.	Facts
Accepting the recommendations of Hearing Committee, the Ministry reiterates its earlier decision dated 31.5.2017 to confirm the conditional permission issued to the Karpagam Faculty of Medical Sciences Research, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and directs the college not to admit MBBS students for the academic year 201718.(emphasis supplied)7.	Facts
Aggrieved, the appellant has filed I.A. No.84171 of 2017 to challenge the correctness of the aforementioned decision of the Competent Authority of the Central Government, reiterating its earlier decision dated 31st May, 2017.8.	Facts
During the arguments, the counsel appearing for the appellant invited our attention to the relevant documents to question the observation recorded by the Executive Committee of the MCI and the Hearing Committee.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended that the impugned decision refers to the observation of the Hearing Committee as reproduced in paragraph 16 of the impugned decision dated 31st August, 2017, which according to the appellant is contrary to the factual position emerging from the record.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any case, contends learned counsel that it is an inconclusive observation and could not have been the basis to pass the impugned decision.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondents, on the other hand, have supported the orders passed by the Competent Authority of the Central Government on 31st May, 2017 and 31st August, 2017 being well considered decisions.9.	Arguments of Respondent
We have heard Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant college, Mr. Vikas Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the MCI and Mr. Maninder Singh, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for Union of India.10.	None
Ordinarily, we would have relegated the parties before the High Court where the writ petition is still pending.	Reasoning
However, as the appellant invited the order dated 11th August, 2017 from this Court and thereafter participated in the proceedings before the Competent Authority of the Central Government, which in turn, has passed the impugned order dated 31st August, 2017 after reconsideration of the matter and as the appellant has chosen to assail the same by way of an I.A. filed in this appeal, coupled with the urgency of the matter, as the cutoff date for admission in MBBS course for the academic session 201718 was to expire on 31st August, 2017 and that cutoff date can be extended only by this Court in exercise of the plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, we permitted the appellant to agitate all the issues before this Court.11.	Reasoning
We have reproduced the order dated 31st May, 2017, passed by the Competent Authority of the Central Government, in its entirety to discern the real issue that needs to be answered in the present appeal.	Reasoning
As noted earlier, the said order is partly in favour of the appellant.	Reasoning
It is adverse only to the extent of debarring the appellant college from admitting students in MBBS course (150 seats) for the academic session 201718 and also not granting recognition approval to the appellant college which had already started MBBS course and admitted five batches of students until the academic session 201617.12.	Reasoning
From the factual narration in the communications sent by the MCI to the Ministry vide letters dated 24th March, 2017 and 29th April, 2017, which inter alia were considered by the Competent Authority of the Central Government to form its opinion, it is indisputable that the appellant college was granted conditional renewal permission by the Central Government on 20th August, 2016 to admit 5th batch (150 seats) in MBBS course for the academic session 201617, on conditions specified by the Oversight Committee (for short OC constituted by this Court) in its communication dated 12th August, 2016.

The said decision of MCI was communicated to the Central Government vide communication dated 29th April, 2017 and copies of the said communication were also forwarded to the Secretary of OC and the appellant college with a request to submit a detailed, pointwise compliance with regard to recognition approval along with documentary evidence in respect of rectification of deficiencies pointed out in the said communication.	None
On the basis of the aforesaid recommendation of the MCI, the Competent Authority of the Central Government took a decision which was partly in favour of the appellant college.	None
In other words, the Ministry did not accept the recommendation of the MCI in toto.	None
The Ministry, instead, vide order dated 31st May, 2017 merely directed the appellant college not to admit students for the academic session 201718, which position has been reiterated in the order dated 31st August, 2017 passed after reconsideration.	None
It is this part of the direction which is adverse to the appellant.16.	None
The fact that the Competent Authority of the Central Government has confirmed the renewal of permission in favour of the appellant for academic session 201617, it would not follow that the appellant college is entitled to grant of recognition approval under Section 11(2) of the Act from the academic session 201718 as a matter of course, without removing the deficiencies pointed out in the latest assessment report dated 10th April, 2017.	Reasoning
The appellant, however, would contend that the correctness of the report dated 10th April, 2017, is seriously in doubt.	Reasoning
For, the previous assessment reports made no reference to the deficiencies regarding faculty and residents in particular.	Reasoning
The Dean of the appellant college had registered his protest and made such noting on the said report  that he did not agree with most of the findings in the report and that he would submit a detailed reply.	Reasoning
Indeed, the assessment reports dated 17th February, 2017 and 15th/16th March, 2017 have noted deficiencies which are not identical to the deficiencies noted in the assessment report dated 10th April, 2017.	Reasoning
It must, however, be kept in mind that the reports are in respect of the factual position noticed during the inspection carried out on the relevant dates.	Reasoning
The variation of deficiencies may be on account of different situations.	Reasoning
Therefore, it may not be correct to discredit the 10th April, 2017 assessment report on the basis of such variations.	Reasoning
It is one thing to say that the college is in a position to explain the deficiencies but whether to accept that explanation, is within the domain of the expert body.	Reasoning
There is nothing to indicate in the communication dated 29th April, 2017 sent by the MCI or, for that matter, the impugned decision of the Competent Authority of the Central Government dated 31st May, 2017, that any plausible explanation was offered by the appellant college in regard to the stated deficiencies.	Reasoning
Even the order dated 31st August, 2017, does not indicate as to whether any explanation was offered by the appellant college during the hearing for reconsideration by the Central Government.	Reasoning
Notably, a member of the OC constituted by this Court was present during the hearing on 25th August, 2017.	Reasoning
The Hearing Committee was of the view that the bed occupancy as claimed by the college cannot be validated by the Committee unless physical verification was done for that purpose.	Reasoning
That finding presupposes that the explanation offered by the appellant college, if any, did not commend to the Hearing Committee.	Reasoning
The fulfilment of benchmark regarding bed occupancy for grant of recognition approval under Section 11(2) of the Act is essential.	Reasoning
That is a precondition for grant of recognition and can certainly be a relevant factor to be considered by the MCI as well as the Hearing Committee.17.	Reasoning
The bed occupancy noticed in the assessment report dated 10th April, 2017 is 62.76 as against the claim made by the college of 78.	Reasoning
The claim of the college was found to be highly inflated.	Reasoning
Even in the earlier assessment reports comments have been made regarding the bed occupancy to be tailor made to suit the assessment.	Reasoning
Suffice it to observe that the Hearing Committee, during the reconsideration, was not convinced about the deficiency regarding bed occupancy until it was physically verified.	Reasoning
It is not for this Court to sit over the satisfaction of the expert body and of the Competent Authority of the Central Government as a Court of appeal.18.	Reasoning
The appellant would then contend that it was not permissible for the MCI to carry out successive inspections.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance has been placed on the dictum of this Court in Kanachur Islamic Education Trust v. Union of India and Anr., (2017) 10 SCALE 321 , decided on 30th August, 2017.	None
This submission does not commend us.	None
For, in the aforementioned case, this Court found that it was unambiguously clear that the inspection of the concerned college was already conducted on 17th/18th November, 2016 and it did not divulge any substantial deficiency so as to justify disapproval.	Reasoning
Further, no reason was assigned for the surprise inspection carried out on 9th/10th December, 2016, in a short span of less than one month.	Reasoning
In that backdrop the Court held that the justification for such surprise inspection was not explained by the MCI.	Reasoning
In the subsequent decision in the case of Royal Medical Trust Anr.	Reasoning
v. Union of India Anr., W.P.(C) No.747 of 2017, decided on 12th September, 2017, the decision in Kanachur Islamic Education Trust (supra) has been explained and the argument under consideration has been rejected.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, in the present case, it is not a case of successive surprise inspections.	Reasoning
For, the inspection conducted on 17th February, 2017 was followed by compliance verification assessment on 15th/16th March, 2017 for considering the proposal for confirmation of renewal of LOP for the academic session 201617 and the inspection carried out on 10th April, 2017 was for considering the proposal regarding recognition approval for the college from academic session 201718.19.	None
Considering the above, it is not possible to doubt the decision of the Ministry dated 31st May, 2017, as confirmed on 31st August, 2017 after reconsideration.	None
The fact that there are some factual errors committed in paragraph 13 of the impugned decision dated 31st August, 2017, regarding the chart pertaining to the some other inspection has been fairly admitted by the counsel for the respondents as a clerical error.	None
But that would not vitiate the order dated 31st August, 2017.	Reasoning
Because, the decision dated 31st May, 2017 is founded on the factual position stated in the recommendation of the MCI vide communications dated 24th March, 2017 and 29th April, 2017, in particular.	Reasoning
The latter communication pertains to the proposal for grant of recognition approval to the appellant college under Section 11(2) of the Act.20.	None
Counsel for the appellant while referring to the communication dated 5th April, 2017 sent by the Under Secretary to Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to the appellant college (AnnexureA/9) vehemently contended that the personal hearing before the Ministry was scheduled on 11th April, 2017, but the inspection of the college was conducted one day earlier.	None
The argument, though attractive at first blush, will have to be rejected.	None
In that, the personal hearing scheduled on 11th April, 2017, in terms of the said communication dated 5th April, 2017, was for considering the proposal for confirmation of renewal permission for 5th batch (150 seats) of students in MBBS course for the academic session 201617, under Section 10(A) of the Act and not related to the issue of grant of recognition approval under Section 11(2) of the Act which was for the academic session 201718.	Reasoning
Whereas, the inspection conducted on 10th April, 2017 was for considering the proposal for grant of recognition under Section 11 of the Act and not pertaining to the proposal for renewal of permission for the academic session 201617.	None
Indisputably, the renewal of permission for the academic session 201617 has been confirmed by the Central Government vide order dated 31st May, 2017, despite the negative recommendation given by the MCI in that behalf.	None
Suffice it to observe that the argument of the appellant is replete with confusion in reference to the record and proceedings relating to two different proposals, namely, one for confirmation of renewal of LOP for the academic session 201617 under Section 10A of the Act and another for grant of recognition approval from academic session 201718 under Section 11 of the Act.	Reasoning
The benchmark and the minimum standards for these proposals are bound to be different and we must presume that the expert body, such as MCI and the Hearing Committee in which one member of the OC also participated, were fully aware of the essentialities and preconditions for grant of recognition approval.	Reasoning
Since the decision of the Competent Authority of the Central Government is based on such inputs, it is not open for us to sit over that decision as a Court of appeal.	Reasoning
Further, as ordained in the decision of Royal Medical Trust (supra), the relief to permit the appellants to admit students for academic session 201718 cannot be countenanced.	Reasoning
In that decision, in paragraph 52, this Court has also rejected the challenge to the order such as dated 31st August, 2017, being bereft of reasons.	Reasoning
That dictum applies on all fours to the present case.21.	Reasoning
Accordingly, we find no merit in this appeal.	Reasoning
Since we have already examined all the issues raised by the appellant for assailing the correctness of the order dated 31st May, 2017 and confirmation thereof on 31st August, 2017 by the Competent Authority of the Central Government, nothing would survive for consideration in the writ petition filed by the appellant before the High Court of Madras.	Reasoning
As a result, Writ Petition No.18334 of 2017 be deemed to have been disposed of in terms of this judgment.22.	Decision
We may, however, make it clear that the proposal for grant of recognition approval submitted by the appellant college for the academic session 201718 be treated as having been made for the academic session 201819 and be processed by the respondents accordingly, in accordance with law.	Decision
For that purpose, the MCI is directed to conduct inspection of the appellant college within two months and inform the appellant about the deficiencies, if any, with the option to remove the same within the time limit specified in that regard.	Decision
The appellant college shall then report its compliance and communicate the removal of deficiencies to MCI, whereafter it will be open to the MCI to undertake verification of the compliance and then prepare its report to be submitted to the Central Government.	Decision
The Central Government shall take appropriate decision, as may be advised, in accordance with law, within one month therefrom and forthwith communicate the same to the appellant college.	Decision
If the appellant college is aggrieved by the said decision, it will be open to the appellant to take recourse to remedies as may be available in law.23.	Decision
The appeal and interlocutory application are disposed of in the above terms.	Decision
No order as to costs.	Decision
