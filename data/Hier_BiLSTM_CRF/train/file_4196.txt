Issue

2.	None
The controversy related to the assessment to sales tax under the Act in respect of cotton, which admittedly is an item of declared goods within the meaning of Section 2, Clause (c) read with Section 14 of the Central Salestax Act, 1956 (Act 74 of 1956) (hereinafter to be referred to as the Central Act).	Facts
3.	Reasoning
As the nature of the dealings and the approach made by the assessing officers in respect of the respondents, who are different assessees, is the same, it is enough to refer to the facts in Civil Appeal No. 2319 of 1968.	Facts
The respondent M s. Shakti Cotton Company is partnership firm carrying on business as a registered dealer under the Act.	Facts
Amongst its other business, the firm purchases kapas or unginned cotton and after ginning sells cotton and cotton seeds.	Facts
For the assessment year 196162, the firm submitted a return under the Act showing its gross turnover of purchase at Rupees 23,76,452.68 n. p.	Facts
This amount included the purchase of unginned cotton i.e. kapas and the sales were shown as having been made to registered dealers and for interState trade and commerce.	Facts
The firm claimed deduction from its gross turnover value of the entire quantity of cotton it had purchased.	Facts
According to the firm, it was entitled to so deduct the purchase price under S. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act.	Facts
If appears that there was originally an order of assessment passed on June 30, 1962.	Facts
On appeal by the firm the Appellate Authority by its order dated February 4, 1963 remanded the matter to the assessing authority for reexamination and reconsideration of the original order of assessment.	Facts
The assessing authority, Patiala District, took up the assessment proceedings afresh and after an examination of the account books and other vouchers produced by the firm accepted as correct the gross turnover returned by the dealer.	Facts
Regarding the various deductions claimed by the firm particularly in respect of the purchase price of unginned cotton which had been sold to registered dealers, it is not clear from the assessment orders as to how exactly the claims for deductions were either allowed or rejected.	Facts
Ultimately, the assessing authority fixed the taxable turnover for the purposes of purchase tax at Rupees 3,18,993.27 n. p. and levied purchase tax on this amount at the rate of 2 per cent.	Facts
The assessment order was passed on September 26, 1963.	Facts
The firm filed in the Punjab High Court Civil Writ No. 452 of 1964 challenging the order of assessment passed by the Salestax Officer.	Facts
The grievance of the firm as is seen from the said writ, is, that the assessing authority disallowed the claim, made by it for deduction of purchase price of ginned cotton sold to the registered dealers and for interState trade and commerce.	Facts
The firms claim before the assessing authority, appears to have been that if three maunds of kapas is ginned, it gives roughtly one maund of ginned cotton which if disposed of in toto should be equivalent to the purchase price of three maunds of kapas originally purchased.	Facts
The assessing authority appears to have proceeded on the basis that out of the total quantity of unginned cotton purchased by the firm, only 1/3rd quantity of the unginned cotton can be considered to have been sold as ginned cotton.	Facts
Deductions, according to the assessing authority, under Section 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act from the purchase turnover of unginned cotton should be fixed at 1/3d of the total price paid for the unginned cotton.	Facts
The assessing authority has also proceeded on the basis that the amount realised by the firm by sale of cotton seeds as a result of ginning cannot be taken into account for calculating the turnover under Section 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the act as the said material is something different from cotton.	Facts
The firm had also challenged the order of assessment that the levy of sales tax on cotton, which is an item of declared goods under the Central Act is illegal and opposed to Section 15 of the Central Act as no stage for levy of tax had been fixed.	Facts
As the Excise and Taxation Commissioner of Punjab had given instruction to the assessing authorities to assess cotton in the manner shown in the assessment order, the firm averred that no useful purpose will be served by carrying the assessment orders in appeals before the Departmental Authorities.	Facts
It was pleaded that as the leery was unconstitutional, the relief can be obtained only from the High Court and hence its jurisdiction under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution was invoked.	Facts
4.	None
The appellants contested the writ petition on various grounds.	Facts
But the material averment, which has to be noted is to the effect that the assessee was entitled to deduction only on the purchase of cotton sold by it as required under S. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the act and that too on the purchase value of the commodity sold and not on its sale price.	Facts
It was further averred that cotton seeds are different from cotton and the price realised by the sale of the former does not qualify for deduction under the said provision of the Act as the cotton seeds are not the same commodity as cotton that had been originally purchased.	Facts
Hence, it was pointed out that the assessing authority had acted according to law in allowing the deduction only on the purchase value of cotton sold by the firm.	Facts
5.	None
The State further pleaded that the stage for levying salestax in respect of declared goods is indicated under the Act and the firm is liable for payment of purchase tax on the purchase of cotton made by it subject to the proper deductions allowable under Section 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act.	Facts
6.	None
At the time when the writ petition was heard by the learned Single Judge of the High Court, there was already a decision of a Division Bench of the same High Court reported in Patel Cotton Company Pvt. Ltd. v. The State of Punjab (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj).	Facts

In this view, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and directed the Salestax Officer to redecide the matter and modify and make an assessment order in accordance with the law laid down in Patel Cotton Company Private Ltd.s case, (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj).	Facts

Mr. V. C. Mahajan, learned counsel for the State, pointed out that the decision in	Arguments of Petitioner
Patel Cotton Co.	Reasoning
Pvt. Ltd., (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj ) which was relied on by the High Court, has been overruled by this Court in State of Punjab v. Chandulal Kishorilal, (1969)3 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 )	Arguments of Petitioner
In consequence, he urged that all the State appeals will have to be allowed and the assessment orders should be allowed to stand.15.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Mr. S. V. Gupte, learned counsel appearing for the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 2319 of 1968 whose contentions have been adopted by the other counsel appearing for the respondents in other appeals, urged that the decisions of this court, relied on by Mr. Mahajan, had no occasion to consider the position regarding collection of sales tax in respect of declared goods coming under the Central Act, after the act was amended by Punjab Act 7 of 1967.	Arguments of Respondent
He further pointed out that neither the principles laid down by this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. v. State of Punjab, (1967) 3 SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) nor the effect of the amendments made to the Act by Punjab Act 7 of 1967, regarding levy and collection of sales tax in respect of declared goods have been considered in (1969) 3	Arguments of Respondent
SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ).	Arguments of Respondent

Mr. Gupte in this connection, relied on the various aspects discussed in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd., (1967) 3	Arguments of Respondent
SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) and the relevant provisions of the Punjab General Sales Tax (Amendment and Validation) Act, 1967 (Act 7 of 1967) (hereinafter referred to as the Amendment Act).	Arguments of Respondent
He further stressed that the Amendment Act has changed the whole scheme of taxation regarding declared goods and a duty has been cast on the assessing authority to reopen the assessment and pass fresh orders in accordance with the Amendment Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The counsel further pointed out that (1969) 3 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) except deciding that cotton seeds do not come under declared goods, had no occasion to consider the language of Section 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act regarding how the deduction is to be allowed.	Arguments of Respondent
17.	None
It is now necessary to consider the provisions of the Act, as it stood on April, 1, 1960.	None
Even here we may say that the entire scheme of the Act and the Rules as well as of the Central Act has been elaborately considered by this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd., (1967)	None
3	Reasoning
SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ).	Reasoning
Hence it is unnecessary to cover the same ground in these appeals.	None
It is enough to note that the expressions dealer goods, prescribed, purchase, sale, turnover and year are defined in Clauses (d), (e), (f), (ff), (h), (I) and (j) of Section 2 respectively.	None
Item I of Schedule C of the Act dealing with Cotton is as follows(1)	None
Cotton, that is to say,.	None
all kinds of cotton (indigenous or imported) in its unmanufactured state, whether ginned or unginned, baled, pressed or otherwise, but not including cotton waste.	None
Section 2 (c) of the Central Act defines declared goods as goods declared under Section 14 to be of special importance in interState trade or commerce.	None
Section 14 declares the various goods referred to therein as of special importance in interState trade or commerce.	None
Therefore, it follows that those goods are declared goods under Section 2 (c) of the Central Act.	None
Item II of Section 14 of the Central Act dealing with cotton is identical with Item I of Schedule C of the Act.	None
It is also necessary to note that the definition of sale in Section 2 (h) of the Act, excluded goods specified in Schedule C and that the expression purchase under Section 2 (ff) took in the goods specified in Schedule C of the Act.	None
Section 5 of the Act dealt with the levy of tax on the turnover of a dealer at the rates mentioned therein and other consequential matters.	None
Subsection (2) dealt with the taxable turnover as well as the various deductions which a dealer is eligible to claim in the computation of the said taxable turnover.	None
The claim for deduction was made by the assessee before us under S. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act which is as follows5 (2) In this Act the expression taxable turnover means that part of a dealers gross turnover during any period which remains after deducting therefrom  (a) his turnover during that period on  (vi) the purchase of goods which are sold not later than six months after the close of the year, to a registered dealer, or in the course of interState trade or commerce, or in the course of export out of the territory of India Provided that in the case of such a sale to a registered dealer, a declaration, in the prescribed form and duly filed and signed by the registered dealer to whom the goods are sold, is furnished by the dealer claiming deduction.	None
18. Section 15 of the Central Act imposes restrictions and conditions in regard to tax on sale or purchase of declared goods within a State.	None
Section 15 (a) placing a restriction on the rate of tax as well as a prohibition regarding such collection at more than one stage is as follows15.	None
Every sales tax law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes or authorises the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of declared goods, be subject to the following restrictions and conditions, namely (a) the tax payable under that law in respect of any sale or purchase of such goods inside the State shall not exceed three per cent of the sale or purchase price thereof, and such tax shall not be levied at more than one stage.	None
19.	None
We have broadly outlined the scheme of the Act as well as the Central Act.	None
There is no controversy that cotton is liable to purchase tax under the Act.	None
It is now necessary to advert to the decision of the Punjab High Court in Patel Cotton Company Private Ltd., (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj).	None
These assessees therein claimed that out of the unginned cotton, which they had purchased and in respect of which they had become liable to pay purchase tax, certain quantities of ginned cotton as well as cotton seeds obtained after ginning, had been sold to registered dealers within the prescribed period or sold in the course of interState trade and commerce.	None
They further claimed that the purchase price of those quantities of ginned cotton and cotton seeds so sold should be deducted in calculating the taxable turnover under S. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act.	Reasoning
The assessing authority allowed the deduction of the sale price (as against the purchase price) of the ginned cotton sold to registered dealers as also the sale price of the ginned cotton exported out of India or sold in the course of interState trade or commerce.	None
The Salestax Officer, however, declined to allow any deduction for similar sales on cotton seeds.	None
The assessee contended before the High Court that the sale of cotton seeds, was a sale of the goods purchased by them, in respect of which, purchase tax was payable and since the sales were made to registered dealers or in the course of interState trade, the taxable turnover should be determined after deducting the purchase price of the goods sold from the gross turnover.	None
20.	None
On behalf of the State, it was contended that unginned cotton and ginned cotton are two different things and if unginned cotton is purchased and purchase tax paid on it and later on the cotton is ginned and sold, no part of the goods purchased can be considered to have been sold.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that cotton seed is a different thing from cotton and therefore the sale price of cotton seeds cannot be deducted under Section 5 (2) (a) (vi).	Arguments of Petitioner
21.	None
The High Court held that no manufacturing process is involved in ginning cotton and in the process of ginning no new commodity is created.	None
The High Court further held that when a dealer buys unginned cotton, which is mixed with cotton seeds and separates the two, by process of ginning and proceeds to sell both the ginned cotton and the cotton seeds, the dealer in fact sells the entire goods which he had purchased.	None
As deduction under Section 5 (2) (a) (vi) is to be the turnover on the purchase of goods which are sold and as the goods (ginned cotton and cotton seeds) sold are the same as purchased, the dealer, is entitled to a full deduction.	None
As the assessing authority has not made the assessment in accordance with the principles laid down by the High Court, the order of assessment was quashed and the assessing authority was directed to make a fresh assessment, in accordance with the decision of the High Court.	None
This decision was rendered on May 14, 1964.	None
22.	None
Certain other decision of the Punjab High Court, similar to the one in Patel Cotton Company Private Ltd., (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj) were the subject of appeals and they were disposed of by this Court on February 27, 1969 in 19693 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ), to which we will refer later.	None
23.	None
In the meanwhile, certain other dealers dealing in cotton had challenged before the Punjab High Court the levy of purchase tax under the Act on the ground that the levy is opposed to the Central Act.	None
One of the contentions was that no stage for collection of the tax, as is mandatory under the Central Act, has been provided for in the Act.	None
The Punjab High Court by its judgment and order dated November 23, 1965 dismissed the writ petitions filed by the assessees.	None
The assessee Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd., (1967) 3 SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) came to this Court in appeal on certificate.	None
This Court after a very elaborate and exhaustive consideration of the Act as well as the Central Act, by majority, upheld the contention of the assessee and held in (1967) 3 SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) that the scheme of levy of purchase tax under Section 2 (ff) read with Section 5 and specially the terms of Section 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act is illegal in that, contrary to the provisions of Section 15 of the Central Act, no definite stage at which the purchase tax in respect of cotton, a declared commodity, is to be levied has been indicated.	None
The judgment and order of the High Court were reversed and the assessment orders quashed.	None
This decision was rendered on April 10, 1967.	None
The years with which this Court was concerned, in the said decision, were the years of assessment 196061 and 196162.	None

Ptv. Ltd., Bhatinda, Civil Appeals Nos. 1120, 1123 and 1214 of 1966, D  1841967 (SC).	Reasoning
This Court, by its judgment dated April 18, 1967 did not think it necessary to consider the correctness or otherwise of the decision of the High Court that the assessees, when they sold ginned cotton and cotton seeds, had sold the same commodity that had been purchased by them.	None
The State appeal was dismissed on the short ground that the levy of purchase tax was opposed to the Central Act as held by this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd., (1967) 3	None

We have already indicated that the certificates were issued in the appeals before us by the High Court in view of the fact that the decision in Patel Cotton Company Pvt. Ltd., (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj) was the subject of appeal in this Court.	None
That appeal was disposed of in the manner, referred to above.	None

None
30.	None
From the various amendments made by the Amendment Act, in the Act, the following aspects broadly emerge there is a definition of declared goods under S. 2 (dd).	None
Certain omissions were made in the second proviso of the act in view of the specific definition of declared goods under S. 2 (dd) and also in view of the fact that the stage, at which tax is to be levied in respect of declared goods is specifically dealt with under the new subsection (3) incorporated in section 5.

Even the provisions contained under subsection (4) of S. 11AA have been made subject to the provisions of subsections (1) to (3) of the said section.	None

It will be seen from the amendments, referred to above, that an entirely new scheme, so to say, has been evolved in the matter of assessment to sales tax of declared goods.	Issue

There is no controversy that purchase tax is to be levied in respect of the said commodity.	Issue

We will now refer to the decision in the said writ petition of this Court in Rattan Lal and Co. v. Assessing Authority Patiala.	None
(1969) 2 SCR 544 (AIR 1970 SC 1742 ) rendered on October 29, 1968.	None
This Court, in the decision had to consider the attack made by certain assessees regarding the validity of the Amendment Act.	None
The contention of the assessees was that the same infirmities, pointed out by this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd., (1967) 3 SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) still exist even in the Amendment Act and hence the levy of sales tax on cotton was illegal.	None
After a reference to the infirmities pointed out in the Act as it stood on April 1, 1960, in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. and after a reference to the Amendment Act, the contention of the assessees was rejected and it was held that the Amendment Act cannot be struck down on the grounds raised by the assessees.	None
This Court finally held that the Amendment Act was valid and the retrospective effect given to it was also equally valid and that the new S. 11AA was not discriminatory.	None
In this view, the attack on the Amendment Act was rejected and the writ petition dismissed.	None

We have already referred to the fact that certain decisions of the Punjab High Court, which had taken a view similar to the one in	None
Patel Cotton Co.	Reasoning
Pvt. Ltd., (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj) were also subject of appeals in this Court.	Facts
They were disposed of on February 27, 1969 by the judgment of this Court in (1969) 3	None
SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ).	Arguments of Respondent
34.	None
The claim made by the assessees before the High Court as that in calculating the taxable turnover under S. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act, as it stood on April 1, 1960, deductions must be made on the purchase price of unginned cotton, which has been sold later as ginned cotton and cotton seeds.	Reasoning
The High Court had accepted this contention.	Reasoning
The State of Punjab had filed the appeals in this Court.	Reasoning
This Court in the above decision, accepted the contention of the State that ginning process is a manufacturing process and that it is by such a manufacturing process that the cotton and the cotton seeds are separated.	Reasoning
This Court further held that it is not correct to say that the it is not correct to say that the seeds so separated, is cotton itself or part of the cotton.	Reasoning
It is the further view of this Court that they are two distinct commercial goods though before the manufacturing process the seeds might have been a part of the cotton itself.	Reasoning
It was further held that the contention of the assessees that the sale of cotton seeds must be treated as a sale of declared goods under the Central Act, cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
In this view the decision of the High Court was set aside and the appeal of the State was allowed.	Reasoning
The orders of the assessing authority declining to grant deduction in respect of cotton seeds sold by the assessees to registered dealers were confirmed.	Reasoning

According to Mr. Mahajan, the decision of this Court in 19693 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) having overruled the decision of the Punjab High Court in	Reasoning
Patel Cotton Co.	Reasoning
Pvt. Ltd. (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj) though not directly, all the appeals before us must be allowed.	Reasoning
Prima facie and on a superficial consideration, it may appear that the contention of Mr. Mahajan is wellfounded.	Reasoning
Going by the actual decision of this Court in 19693 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ), it must be said that the principle laid down by the Punjab High Court in	Reasoning
Patel Cotton Co.	Reasoning
Pvt. Ltd., (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj) which decision has been relied on by the High Court in the appeals before us, must be considered to have been overruled.	Reasoning
But there are difficulties in accepting the contention of Mr. Mahajan, that in view of this circumstance, the State appeals before us must be allowed.	Reasoning
37.	None
We have already referred to the fact that the levy of sales tax under the Act as it stood on April 1 1960, in cotton, which is an item of declared goods was struck down by this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. (1967) 3	Reasoning
SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ).Certain	Reasoning
provisions of the Act were also struck down as violative of the provisions of the Central Act.	Reasoning
It was in consequence of the decision of this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. that the Amendment Act, which was preceded by the two Ordinances, referred to above, came to be enacted.	Reasoning
We have also referred to the fact that the scheme of assessment regarding declared goods has been changed and altered by the Amendment Act.	Reasoning
When the Amendment Act was again challenged before this Court, the Constitution bench in Rattan Lal and Co. (1969) 2	Reasoning
SCR 544 (AIR 1970 SC 1742 ) has approved the decision in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. and accepted the position that under the Act, as it stood on April 1, 1960, sales tax in respect of declared goods could not be levied.	Reasoning
Further it was pointed out in Rattan Lal and Co. that the infirmities that existed in the Act, as it stood on April 1, 1960 had been removed and the Amendment act was valid.	Reasoning
With great respect to the learned Judges, who decided (1969) 3 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 )	Reasoning
it must be held that there is absolutely no reference to the decision of this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. and Rattan Lal and Co.	Reasoning
Nor is there any reference to the decision in Civil Appeals Nos. 1120, 1123 and 1214 of 1966, D  1841967 (SC) which were appeals filed by the State directly challenging the decision of the High Court in	Reasoning
Patel Cotton Co.	Reasoning
Pvt. Ltd. (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj).	Reasoning
All these three decisions, as mentioned by us earlier, have uniformly held that no sales tax can be levied under the Act, as it stood on April 1, 1960 in respect of declared goods.	Reasoning
This Court in (1969) 3 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) had to deal with a case of assessment of sales tax under the Act, as it originally stood, in respect of cotton, which is an item of declared goods, for the assessment year 196162.	Reasoning
Such an assessment for the said year had been struck down as illegal and void in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. (1967) 3	Reasoning
SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) and in The State of Punjab v.	Reasoning
Patel Cotton Co.	Reasoning
Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd.	Reasoning
Bhatinda, Civil Appeals Nos. 1120, 1123 and 1214 of 1966, D  1841967 (SC).	Reasoning
The decision in (1969) 3 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) has, however, proceeded on the basis that all the relevant assessments, with which they were concerned, had to be dealt with under the Act, as it stood on April 1, 1960 and that has to be applied to the declared goods.	Reasoning
38.	None
On such a reasoning, S. 5 (2) (a) (vi) of the Act was applied and the assessment held to be valid and the deductions declined by the officer were approved.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the decision in (1969) 3	Reasoning
SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) cannot enable the appellant State.	Reasoning
To have the appeals before us straightway allowed.	Reasoning
That will amount to ignoring the decisions of this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd., (1967) 3	Reasoning
SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) Rattan Lal and Co. (1969) 2	Reasoning
SCR 544 (AIR 1970 SC 1742 ) and The State of Punjab v.	Reasoning

Ltd.	Reasoning
Bhatinda, Civil Appeals Nos. 1120, 1123 and 1214 of 1966, D  1841967 (SC).	Reasoning
39.	None
More important than all these, is the circumstance, that by accepting the contention of Mr. Mahajan,we will be completely ignoring the provisions of the Amendment Act which, we have already said, has evolved a new scheme regarding the levy of sales tax in respect of declared goods.	Reasoning
The decision in (1969) 3 SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) can at the most be considered to have decided that cotton seeds are not declared goods and that it is by the manufacturing process that cotton and cotton seeds are separated.	Reasoning
As the Act, as amended by the Amendment Act, has to be applied in respect of assessment of sales tax on declared goods, the decision in (1969) 3	Reasoning
SCR 84 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) is, in our opinion, no bar to the assessees urging their objections regarding the validity of the orders of assessment.	Reasoning
Further, this Court had no occasion to consider in (1969) 3	Reasoning
SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 )whether when unginned cotton has been purchased and the entire quantity of ginned cotton obtained therefrom has been sold, the price obtained from the latter is a turnover on the purchase of goods which are sold within the meaning of S. 5 (2) (a) (vi), even on the basis that the said provision applies, Further, in the said decision, this Court had no occasion to consider the question whether purchase price or sale price has to be taken into account under cl.	Reasoning
(vi), nor had it occasion to consider the question whether the mere sale of cotton seeds, even though the entire ginned cotton obtained from unginned cotton originally purchased, has been sold, will make any difference in such circumstances.	Reasoning
All these matters have neither been adverted to nor considered by this Court in the said decision.	None
In fact, if we may say so with respect, when an assessment under the Act, as it stood on April 1, 1960 in respect of declared goods is illegal, the question what deduction, if any, should or should not be allowed in calculating the turnover, in respect of such goods, should not at all arise.	Reasoning
40.	None
From the discussions contained above, it follows that the assessments before us, cannot be confirmed on the basis of the Act, as it stood on April, 1, 1960, as urged by Mr. Mahajan.	Reasoning
That contention is opposed to the decision of this Court in Bhawani Cotton Mills Ltd. (1967) 3	Reasoning
SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ).	Reasoning
41.	None
It may also be pointed out that even in the writ petition, the assessees have challenged that the levy of sales tax is illegal, as no stage has been fixed as is mandatory under the Central Act.	Reasoning
No doubt, the High Court has not considered this question, as it was satisfied that the writ petitions can be disposed of on the basis of the decision in	Reasoning
Patel Cotton Co.	Reasoning
Ptv. Ltd. (1964) 15 STC 865 (Punj).	Reasoning
42.	None
We have already referred to the elaborate provisions made in the new section 11AA added in the Act by S. 9 of the Amendment Act.	Reasoning
The new section casts a duty on the assessing authority, even without any application being made by the assessee in that behalf, to review all assessments and reassessments made before the commencement of the Amendment Act in respect of declared goods.	Reasoning
There is no controversy that the assessment orders, in the cases before us, have all been made before the date of commencement of the Amendment Act.	Reasoning
If so, the assessing authority has to exercise his jurisdiction under S. 11A.	Reasoning
It is also obligatory on his part to vary or revise the previous orders of assessment, so as to bring them in conformity with the provisions of the Act as amended by the Amendment Act, after following the procedure indicated therein.	Reasoning
The fact that there is a judgment of a Court is also no bar to the assessing authority to do his duty cast upon him under S. 11AA.	Reasoning
This has been made clear by subsection (4) to S. 11AA, which makes the said subsection subject to the provisions of subsections (1) to (3) of the section.	Reasoning
43.	None
In view of the specific provisions contained in S. 1AA, we do not think it necessary to considered and express any opinion regarding the contention of Mr. Gupte.	Reasoning
The assessees are entitled to raise all objections available to them in law or on facts in respect of declared goods, when the assessing authority takes action under S. 11AA of the Act, as he is bound to do.	Reasoning
But we make it clear that in the fresh assessment proceedings, the assessing authority has to consider the matter, in the light of the provisions of the amendment Act incorporated in the Act and the decision of this Court in (1969)	Reasoning
3	Reasoning
SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) cannot operate to the prejudice of the assessees.	Reasoning
We have already made it clear that the said decision has decided the question of assessment of declared goods under the provisions of the Act, as they stood on April 1, 1960 which provisions have no application for levy of sales tax in respect of declared goods as held by this Court in Bhawami Cotton Mills Ltd. (1967)	Reasoning
3	Reasoning
SCR 577 (AIR 1967 SC 1616 ) and two other cases referred to above.	Reasoning
Therefore, the fresh revised assessments will have to be made, without reference to the decision in (1969) 3	Reasoning
SCR 849 (AIR 1969 SC 1073 ) which decision has no application, when the question has to be now decided, on the basis of the Act, as amended by the Amendment Act.	Reasoning
44.	None
We have already pointed out that in all the appeals, except in Civil Appeal No. 1963 of 1969, the learned Single Judge has directed the assessing authority to reconsider and vary the order of assessment.	Reasoning
That direction has been confirmed by the Letters Patent Bench in the said appeals.	Reasoning
Those directions in our opinion, do not require any interference by this Court, except to make it clear that the fresh assessments will have to be made under S. 11AA of the Amendment Act, and subject to the directions contained in this judgment.	Reasoning
45.	None
Regarding Civil Appeal No. 1466 of 1969, the learned Single Judge has quashed the order of assessment and that has confirmed by the Letters Patent Bench in Letters Patent Appeal No. 27 of 1965.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the High Court was not justified in quashing the assessment order in toto.	Reasoning
The proper direction should have been, as given in other writ petitions, namely, to direct the assessing authority to reconsider the assessment order.	Reasoning
Therefore, the order of the learned Singh Judge in Civil Writ No. 810 of 1964, as confirmed in Letters Patent Appeal No. 127 of 1965, quashing the order of assessment dated March 10, 1964, will have to be set aside.	Decision
The assessing authority will reconsider and revise the assessment order dated March 10, 1964 in accordance with the provisions of S. 11AA of the Act and pass a revised order of assessment in conformity with the Act, as amended by the Amendment Act.	Decision
46.	None
Before closing, we must mention that Mr. Gupte, brought to our notice a decision of the Punjab High Court in M s. Aryavarta Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. The State of Punjab 1970 Rev. LR 341 (Punj) regarding as to how the assessment is to be made in respect of declared goods, after the Amendment Act.	Decision
As we have directed the assessing authority to exercise his jurisdiction under S. 11AA, we do not think it necessary to deal with this decision any further.	Decision
47.	None
Subject to the directions and observations contained above, Civil Appeals, Nos. 2319 and 2320 of 1968 and 1467, 1469 and 1470 of 1969 are dismissed.	Decision
Civil Appeal No. 1466 of 1969 is allowed to the limited extent of modifying the order of the High Court, as indicated earlier.	Decision
Parties will bear their own costs in all these appeals.	Decision
48.	None
Order accordingly.	None
