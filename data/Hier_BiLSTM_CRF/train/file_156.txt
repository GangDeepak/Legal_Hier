None
I would like to draw your attention to Section 143(1D) of Income Tax Act (1D) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1), the processing of a return shall not be necessary, where a notice has been issued to the assessee under subsection (2)	None
The case is under compulsory scrutiny for AY 2017 18 and as per section 241A of Income Tax, Act 1961 For every assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 2017, where refund of any amount becomes due to the assessee under the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 143 and the Assessing Officer is of the opinion, having regard to the fact that a notice has been issued under subsection (2) of Section 143 in respect of such return, that the grant of the refund is likely to adversely affect the revenue, he may, for reasons to be recorded in writing and with the previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, as the case may be, withhold the refund up to the date on which the assessment is made.	Facts
Considering, pending special audit, pending scrutiny, pending demands of amount of more than 4500 crore, it will prejudicial to the interest of revenue to process the returns without completion of the pending scrutiny cases.	Facts
Therefore, exercising the powers under section 143(1D) of Income Tax Act, 1961 and under Section 241A of Income Tax Act, 1961, the undersigned decline the processing of returns under Section 143(1).	Facts
The above decision has been taken after taking into cognizance the order of Honorable High Court of Delhi in TATA TELESERVICES LIMITED versus CENTRAL BOARD OF DIRECT TAXES ANR.	Facts
dated 11.05.2016 in para 24 of the judgment The question whether such return should be processed will have to be decided by the ASSESSING OFFICER concerned exercising his discretion in terms of Section 143 (1D) of the Act.	Facts
H In the meantime, on 13.07.2018 a revised return was filed by the appellant for AY 201718 claiming refund of Rs.744.94 Crores.	Facts
A notice under Section 143(2) of the Act was issued to the appellant on 10.08.2018 for AY 201718.	Facts
I On 31.08.2018, VMSL merged with Idea Cellular Ltd. and the resultant company was named V odafone Idea Ltd.	Facts
J By its judgment and order dated 14.12.2018, the High Court dismissed said Writ Petition.	None
J1 The submissions of the appellant were recorded as under V odafone also place reliance on the decision of this Court in Tata Teleservices Limited vs. CBDT, 386 ITR 30 and Bombay High Court in Group M Media India (P) vs. Union of India, 2016 SCC OnLine Bom 13624, which held that the return should be processed within a year and only where the assessing officer is of the view that issuance of refund would be detrimental to collection of demands which may arise, he may invoke the provision of Section 143(1D) of the Act.	Facts
With respect to the delay in processing of the tax return, V odafone places reliance on the decision of this Court in Tata Teleservices Limited vs. Central Board of Direct Taxes (supra), and the decision of the Bombay High Court in Group M Media India (P) vs Union of India (supra), where it was held that the return should be processed within a year and only where the assessing officer is of the view that issuance of refund would be detrimental to collection of demands that may arise, he may invoke the provision of Section 143(1D) of the Act.	Facts
From the perusal of Section 241A of the Act, it is evident that all tax returns are necessarily to be processed within the time period as prescribed under Section 143(1) of the Act.	Facts
In the instant case, it is noteworthy that the time period prescribed under Section 143(1) of the Act has expired and there has been no correspondence from the revenue that discretion under Section 143(1D) was exercised.	Facts
It was contended that after the lapse of the one year period, by reason of second proviso to Section 143 (1), the right to claim refund is vested in any assessee.	Facts
Counsel argued that this is independent of the Revenues power to issue a scrutiny notice under Section 143 (2), for which the period of limitation is longer.	Facts
However, if the Assessing Officer does not issue any notice, or intimation, if the assessee can claim refund, that right is a statutorily vested one if, within the said period of one year, a reasoned order is not made under Section 143 (1D) within the said one year period.	Facts
J2 On the other hand, the submissions on behalf of the respondents were  The revenue denies allegations of deliberate omission to refund amounts aggregating to Rs.4759.74 crores along with applicable interest and states that income tax returns were not processed under Section 143(1).	Facts
The assessment years under consideration were picked up for scrutiny under Section 143(3) and there is a prima facie likelihood of a substantial demand being raised by the Income Tax Department, as has been done earlier in V odafones earlier case.	Facts
Further, the revenue submitted that in V odafones own case for the AY 201112 wherein the returned loss was Rs. 33,93,397 and subsequently, the income determined by the Assessing Officer was Rs.546,64,25,250/. Counsel for the Revenue contended that for the relevant period under consideration, the Assessing Officer has already issued notice under subsection (2) of Section 143 within time.	Facts
As per the then prevailing provision, it was thereafter not necessary for the Assessing Officer to proceed under subsection (1) of Section 143.	Facts
Further, the Ld.	Facts
Counsel placed reliance on Section 143(1D) of the Act to explain that the refund has not been processed till date.	Facts
The Ld. Counsel urged that subsection (1D) of section 143 which starts with a nonobstante clause provided that notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1), the processing of the return shall not be necessary before the expiry of the period specified in the second proviso where a notice has been issued to the assessee under Section 143(2).	Facts
The provisio to Section 143 (1D) provided that such return shall be processed before the issuance of an order under subsection (3).	Facts
Therefore, Section 143 (1D) overrides Section 143 (1).	Facts
Therefore, the counsel submitted that under Section 143(1D) of the Act, the processing of return shall not be necessary, where notice has been issued under Section 143(2) of the Act.	Facts
The Counsel placed on record letter F.No.	Facts
ACIT C26(2)/201819/216 dated 23.07.2018.	Facts
It is in response to the multiple communications by the assessee for expeditious processing of returns for different AYs.	Facts
The order informs that the cases are pending for scrutiny as follows for the AY 201213 and 201314, the assessment is under special audit and for the AY 201415, the assessee approached the AAR and lastly, returns for AYs 201516 and 2016 17, are under scrutiny.	Facts
The assessment years for which request has been made to process the return under Section 143(1) are already under scrutiny for the various AYs.	Facts
Therefore, exercising the power under Section 143(1D), the Assistant Commissioner declined the processing of returns under Section 143(1).	Facts
Further, the case is under compulsory scrutiny for AY 20172018, exercising the power Section 241A, the Assistant Commissioner declined the processing of returns under Section 143(1) J3 After considering rival submissions, relevant statutory provisions and the decisions relied upon, the High Court observed In the facts of the present case, the issue canvassed is on the interpretation of Section 143 (1D) of the Act.	Facts
It is first necessary to refer to the statutory provisions and thereafter consider the effect of such provisions on V odafones request for refund for the said assessment years.	Facts
On reading of the Section 143 of the Act, it is apparent that when returns are filed either under Section 139 or pursuant to a notice under Section 142(1), Section 143(1) mandates that the returns shall be processed in the manner prescribed in the clauses (a) to (e) thereof.	Facts
The processing of a return thus involves determination of total income or loss, tax and interest, if any, payable and sum payable by, or the amount of refund due to the assessee.	Facts
Section 143(1)(d) stipulates that an intimation shall be prepared or generated and sent to the assessee specifying the sum determined payable by, or the amount of refund due to the assessee under clause(C).	Facts
Section 143 (1) (e) provides that the amont of refund due in pursuance of the determination under clause (C) shall be granted to the assessee.	Facts
A reading of proviso to Section 143 (1) reveals that it mandates that the intimation as provided in Section 143 (1) (d) should be issued before the expiry of one year from the end of the financial year in which the return is made.	Facts
Before proceeding to Section 143(1D) as it stood at the relevant time, it is essential to refer to Section 143 (2) and (3).	Facts
Subsection (2) contemplates issuance of a notice in the contingency covered by the said provision.	Facts
Subsection (3) provides that once such a notice is served, after following the procedure laid, the Assessing Officer is required to pass an order in writing making an assessment of the total income or loss and determine the sum payable by the assessee or refund of any amount due to him on the basis of the assessment.	Facts
It is also relevant to notice that whether it is the processing of a return under Section 143(1) or an order under Section 143(3) is subject to the same time limit, i.e. Section 153(1).	Facts
A reading of the above judgments and the relevant provisions, clearly shows that Section 143(2) empowers, the Assessing Officer to issue notice to the assessee to produce documents or other evidence, to prove the genuineness of the income tax return.	Facts
Under Section 143(1D) of the Act an introduced by the Finance Act, 2012 processing of a return under Section 143 (1)(a) is not necessary where a notice has been issued under Section 143(2) of the Act.	Facts
This provision has now been amended by the Finance Act, 2016 (with effect from the AY 201718) to provide that if scrutiny notice is issued under Section 143(2), processing of return shall not be necessary before the expiry of one year from the end of the financial year in which return is submitted.	Facts
The assesses argument in these proceedings is that once the one year period in proviso to Section 143(1) ends, the return  and whatever calculations are contained in it, with respect to tax liability as well as the consequential refunds, become final, subject to only one event issuance of notice under Section 143 (2).	Facts
To this Court, it appears that the net effect of Tata Teleservices (supra) is that the revenue cannot be inactive, in cases where the assessee claims refund, and the one year period is over (under proviso to Section 143(1) ends.	Facts
The Assessing Officer has to apply his mind to consider whether the facts and circumstances of the case, warrant some or all of the refund of the assessees amounts, or if all of it needs to be withheld, whenever the assessee presses for refund.	Facts
This exercise should be undertaken promptly, keeping in mind the time limit under the normal provision of Section 143(1) expires.	Facts
This Court held in Tata Teleservices Ltd. (supra) and the Bombay High Court in case of Group M Media India (P) Ltd. (supra) that it would be wholly inequitable for the Assessing Officer to merely sit over the petitioners request for refund citing the availability of time up to the last date of framing the assessment under Section 143 (3).	Facts
The proper interpretation of the statute and the situation in such a case would be, the Assessing Officer should take up an expeditious disposal of the question once the assessee requests for release of the refund.	Facts
Now in this case, acknowledgement or intimation had not been sent by the Assessing Officer.	Facts
There is no doubt that the period of one year indicated in the second proviso to Section 143 (1).	Facts
However, Section 143 (1D) begins with a nonobstante clause that overbears that provision.	Facts
Tata Teleservices (supra) and the Bombay High Court ruling in Group M Media India (supra) state that the fact that a regular assessment is resorted to, does not ipso facto mean that in every case, the Assessing Officer has to refuse refunds or there is an automatic bar to refunds.	Facts
The Assessing Officer has to apply his mind and make an order keeping in perspective the facts of the case.	Facts
In this case, the revenue has relied on an order dated 28.07.2018, which inter alia, stated that considering pending special audit, pending scrutiny, opening demands of amount more than 4500 crore, it will be prejudicial to the interest of the revenue to process the returns without completion of the pending scrutiny cases.	Facts
Therefore, exercising powers under Section 143(1) and under Section 241A of the Act, the undersigned decline the processing of returns under Section 143(1).	Facts
The senior counsel for V odafone had attacked the reliance on this order, stating that it was made later.	Facts
However, that is an aspect this Court cannot go into.	Facts
Facially, the order contains reasons.	Facts
Therefore, unlike Tata Teleservices, a reasoned order was made that decision was based on a circular, which fettered the Assessing Officers discretion.	Facts
Therefore, the CBDT circular was set aside.	None
As far as the argument that the expiry of the one year period, per second proviso to Section 143(1) resulting in finality of the intimation of acceptance, this Court is of opinion that the deeming provision in question, i.e. Section 143 (1) (d) only talks of two eventualities shall be deemed to be the intimation in a case where no sum is payable by, or refundable to, the assessee under clause (c), and where no adjustment has been made under clause (a).	Facts
Secondly, that intimation or acknowledgement cannot confer any greater right than for the assessee to ask the Assessing Officer to process the refund and make over the money it is up to the Assessing Officer  wherever the possibility of issuing a notice under Section 143 (2) exists, or where such notice has been issued, to apply his mind, and decide whether given the nature of the returns and the potential or likely liability, the refund can be given.	Facts
It does not mean that when an assessment  pursuant to notice under Section 143(2) is pending, such right to claim refund can accrue.	Facts
This Court also recollects the decision of the Supreme Court in Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax v Zuari Estate Development Investment Co Ltd. 2015 (15) SCC 248 which held that an intimation under Section 143 (1) is not to be considered as an assessment.	Facts
K	None
On 27.12.2018 and 31.12.2018, Draft Assessment Orders in terms of Section 144 C of the Act were passed for AY 201415 and AY 201516 respectively.	None
L In the Special Leave Petition (from which this appeal arises) questioning the aforesaid decision of the High Court, notice was issued by this Court on 18.01.2019.	Facts
In the affidavit in reply, the respondents asserted That having extracted the relevant provisions, it would be relevant to state that the petitioner itself has made several averments before the High Court that is facing precarious financial conditions with an accumulated loss of Rs.5,557 crores and debts amounting to Rs.53,000 crores as on 31.03.2017.	Facts
It is equally pertinent to state that the Respondent Revenue had filed a counter affidavit on 3rd July, 2018 against the Writ Petition in the High Court of Delhi wherein it has been categorically averred that there are huge pending demands against the petitioner herein more than of Rs.5000 Crores.	Facts
The contents of the Counter Affidavit before the High Court may be treated as a part and parcel of the present Affidavit.	Facts
It has been stated that multiple issues on which addition have been made giving rise to the demand liabilities, and several of such issues are also recurring in nature.	Facts
That it is also submitted that the order dated 23rd July, 2018 passed by the Assessing Officer is an order under Section 143(1)(D) for the assessment years 201213 to 201617 as evident from a bare reading of the said order giving reasons for refusal of refund claimed by V odafone Mobile Service Limited.	Facts
As far as the refusal of refund claimed for the A.Y .	Facts
201718 is concerned, the said order draws its power under Section 241A of the Act as clearly stated in the order dated 23rd July, 2018.	Facts
Reference was made to various pending proceedings where the demands raised for earlier assessment years were stayed and it was stated That it is wrong to say that the letter order dated 23.07.2018 issued by Respondent No.1 u s 143(1D) and 241A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is beyond limitation, bereft of any cogent reasoning and without jurisdiction as the letter order was issued for good reasons to protect the interest of the revenue which is reflected vide	None
Para 45 of the impugned judgment.	Facts
The reasoning was based upon pending special audit, pending scrutiny and pending demands of more than Rs.5000 crore.	Facts
Further, the letter order was not beyond limitation because Section 143(1D) starts with a nonobstante clause, which is over and above the provisions of Section 143(1), which has been discussed in Para 44 of the impugned judgment.	None
M	None
On 14.03.2019 an intimation was sent to the appellant by the respondent No.1 regarding withholding of refund for AY 201718.	None
It stated about the demand status for earlier assessment years as under  table Thereafter, it went on to state	None
It is also to be noted that earlier refund was withheld vide notesheet dated 23.07.2018 after due approval due to nonavailability of proceeding of return facility in ITBA for AY 201718 which was intimated to the assessee vide letter dated 23.07.2018.	Facts
In view of the above discussion there is sufficient reason to believe that issue of refund will negatively impact the interest of the revenue.	Facts
Therefore, proposal for withhold the refund for AY .201718 was forwarded again to Pr.	Facts
Commissioner of Income Tax09, Delhi and same has been approved.	Facts
Approval on note sheet was taken as well as procedure for approval through ITBA was also followed for withholding of refund which also involves approval from PCIT09.	Facts

N Objections raised by the appellant against the Draft Assessment Orders issued on 27.12.2018 and 31.12.2018 were disposed of on 20.09.2019.	None
Thereafter, Final Assessment Orders under Section 143 (3) of the Act were passed on 31.10.2019 for AY 201415 and 20152016, whereunder the appellant was held entitled to refund of Rs.733 Crores (approximately) in respect of AY 201415, whereas for AY 20152016 the claim for refund was rejected and demand in the sum of Rs.582 Crores (approximately) was raised.	Facts
In an appeal preferred by the appellant, said demand for AY 201516, has, since then, been stayed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.	Facts
The relevant dates and the factual developments as stated above, can be summarized in a tabular form as under table In this appeal, we heard Mr. J.D. Mistri, learned Senior Advocate for the appellant and Mr. Zoheb Hossain, learned Advocate for the respondents.	None
During the course of arguments, it was accepted by the respondents that insofar as AY 201718 was concerned, the order dated 23.07.2018 passed under Section 143(1D) of the Act was without jurisdiction, as by that time no order was passed under Section 143(2) of the Act for the concerned Assessment Year.	Facts
It was submitted that in the circumstances, a fresh order was passed on 14.03.2019 after due compliance of the statutory requirements.	Facts
In order to verify the developments leading to the passing of order dated 14.03.2019, the concerned record was summoned and perused.	Facts
The Court was satisfied that all the antecedent steps leading to said order were taken in accordance with law and settled practice.	None
An affidavit was also filed on behalf of the respondents explaining in detail the developments leading to the passing of order dated 14.03.2019 and issuance of intimation dated 09.04.2019.	Facts
It was stated That as per CPC accounting of the return was completed on 9 th April, 2019 and intimation u s 143(1) was generated on 9 th April, 2019.	Facts
It is also evident from Page 1 of the intimation dated 09.04.2019 that contrary to the allegations of the Petitioner that the intimation u s 143(1) was never communicated to them, it is submitted that the intimation u s 143(1) was sent to the email address provided by the assessee, that is, atul.goelvodafoneidea.com That it was in this background that the screenshot relied upon by the assessee during the course of the hearing shows that the ITR was processed on 09.04.2019.	Facts
The intimation under Section 143(1) was made on 09.04.2019 and the said intimation stated that refund determined under Section 143(1) in the said intimation has been withheld as per the proviso of Section 241A and that the refund if any will be released on completion of the assessment under Section 143(3)/144(4) as the case may be along with the interest under Section 244A and subject to adjustment of arrears demand, if any under Section 245.

After conclusion of oral hearing, the parties also filed their written submissions.	None
It was submitted by the appellant In the facts of the present case, admittedly, for AYs 201415 to 201617 (for which provisions of Section 143(1D) of the Act are relevant), the Respondent has neither processed the return of income for the said years by the last date, viz.	Arguments of Petitioner
31.03.2018 nor did the Respondent exercise the discretion provided under Section 143(1D) of the Act by that.	Arguments of Petitioner
As per the Respondents own submission, such discretion under Section 143(1D) of the Act was only exercised vide letter order dated 23.07.2018, which admittedly is beyond the limitation period.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the exercise of such discretion, having been made beyond limitation is a nullity in the eyes of law and, hence, no cognizance can be taken of such a letter order.	Arguments of Petitioner
Insofar as the Assessment Year 201718 is concerned, the Respondents during the course of arguments, before this Honble Court have admitted that order dated 23.07.2018 was without jurisdiction because on that date, neither the return of income was processed, nor a notice under Section 143(2) issued, warranting exercise of powers under Section 241A of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
On that ground alone, the Impugned Order insofar as Assessment Year 201718 is concerned should be set aside and the refund claimed for that year should be granted with interest Having admitted that the Order dated 23.07.2018 was without jurisdiction, the Respondent set up an alternate case that the time limit for processing the return of income expires on 31.03.2020 and, therefore, the proceedings for AY 201718 are inchoate and no direction may be issued for that year.	Arguments of Petitioner
When it was pointed out that processing has already been completed vide intimation dated 09.04.2019, the Respondent changed its stand and argued that a letter dated 14.03.2019 was issued after filing of the counter affidavit before this Honble Court on 06.03.2019, seeking to again exercise powers under Section 241A of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Admittedly, as per the efiling portal of the Income Tax Department, and the intimation produced by the Respondent before this Honble Court on 08.01.2020, the processing of the return for AY 2017 18 was completed only on 09.04.2019 and, therefore, the alleged exercise of power under Section 241A on 14.03.2019 is without jurisdiction since it suffered from the same vice as the Order dated 23.07.2018, i.e. refunds could not have been withheld under Section 241A prior to processing of the return of income Without prejudice to the submission that the Order dated 23.07.2018 issued for the AYs 201415 to 2016 17 was without jurisdiction, having been issued beyond limitation and the Orders dated 23.07.2018 and 14.03.2019 invoking jurisdiction under Section 241A of the Act for the AY 201718 have no sanctity of law since the sine qua non for invoking that Section, i.e. processing of return was completed on 09.04.2019, even on merits, neither the Order dated 23.07.2018 nor the order dated 14.03.2019 disclose any grounds on which powers under Section 143(1D) or Section 241A of the Act could have been invoked.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondents submitted On merits, it is submitted that if the AO issued a Notice u s 143(2) within the time limit i.e. 6 months from the end of the financial year in which return was filed, then there is no longer a requirement to process the return under Section 143(1).	Arguments of Respondent
That being the position of law laid down by the Honble Supreme Court, the discretion under Section 143(1D) can be exercised at any point prior to the passing of the final assessment order.	None
The entire objective of not processing a return after issuance of a scrutiny notice is that in cases where there is a likelihood of substantial demands, there should not be a compulsion on the Revenue to issue refunds.	None
There is no anomaly in the above legislative scheme which warrants dilution of the nonobstante clause and to read into Section 143(1D) a limitation which the legislature has not prescribed It is well settled that a nonobstante clause is a legislative device which is employed to give overriding effect to some or all contrary provisions and as such, the operation of a nonobstante clause cannot be limited in any manner and must be given its full effect The High Court at para 44 has categorically held that since Section 143(1D) begins with a nonobstante clause, it will overbear override the second proviso to Section 143(1) which contains a limitation period of one year for precession of return.	Arguments of Respondent
Without prejudice to the submission that the merits of the order dated 23.07.2018 as well as order dated 14.03.2019 has never been assailed by the Petitioner before any forum, nor any arguments advance during the hearing before the High Court and that the same cannot be raised for the first time before this Honble Court in an SLP, it is submitted that the AO had withheld refund in all these years for cogent and valid reasons, in the interest of the revenue, subject to final scrutiny assessment proceedings.	None
It is submitted that the scope of judicial review against such an order where the AO has exercised his discretion would be limited and any interference can only be done if such an exercise of power is either wholly capricious or without any valid reasons.	Arguments of Respondent
The interrelation between subsections of Section 143 of the Act, as the Section then stood, was subject matter of discussion by this Court in CIT v. Gujarat Electricity Board (2003) 260 ITR 84 which in turn referred to the decision of the Gujarat High Court in Gujarat Poly Avx Electronics Ltd. v. Dy.	None

This Court observed The learned counsel appearing for the respondent have pointed out that in a number of judgments several High Courts have consistently taken the view that once regular assessment proceedings have commenced under Section 143(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, it is a limitation on the jurisdiction of the assessing officer to commence proceedings under Section 143(1)(a) of the Act.	None
Even, otherwise, the view taken by the Gujarat High Court seems to be correct on principle.	None
There is no dispute that Section 143(1)(a) of the Act enacts a summary procedure for quick collection of tax and quick refunds.	None
Under the scheme if there is a serious objection to any of the orders made by the assessing officer determining the income, it is open to the assessee to ask for rectification under Section 154.	None
Apart therefrom, the provisions of Section 143(1) (a)(i) indicate that the intimation sent under Section 143(1)(a) shall be without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (2).	None
The legislature, therefore, intended that where the summary procedure under subsection (1) has been adopted, there should be scope available for the Revenue, either suo motu or at the instance of the assessee to make a regular assessment under sub section (2) of Section 143.	None
The converse is not available a regular assessment proceeding having been commenced under Section 143(2), there is no need for a summary proceeding under Section 143(1) (a).	None

The facts and relevant submissions in Gujarat Poly Avx Electronics Ltd. 2 were recorded in the decision of the Gujarat High Court as under On 12th September, 1994 the assessee submitted a return of loss of Rs.1,74,78,530 for the assessment year 199394 as per the computation of income and depreciation chart annexed to the petition at Annexure A.	None
The assessee claimed depreciation of Rs. 1,74,78,526.	None
Manufacturing activities started on 24 th March, 1993, i.e. during the accounting year ending on 31st March, 1993 (the assessment year 199394).	None
It was specifically pointed out that the amount of interest received during the public issue of Rs. 1,07,85,590 is not to be considered as income and has been given set off against the interest outgoings included under preoperative expenditure in view of several decisions including that of the apex Court.	None
As stated by the learned counsel, on filing of the return, the Assessing Officer (AO) under the new scheme for the assessment under Section 143 of the Act, had two options i.e., (i) either to accept the return under s. 143(1) with necessary adjustments, if there is any, or (ii) to proceed to make assessment under Section 143(3) or under Section 144 by issuing notice under Section 143(2) of the Act.	None
In the instant case, instead of accepting the return under Section 143(1) of the Act, undisputedly, the Assessing Officer issued notice under Section 143(2) of the Act on 1st December, 1994, vide Annexure C.	None
It is contended in the petition that in continuation of the notice the Assessing Officer addressed a letter on 15th November, 1995 calling upon the assessee to attend on 27th November, 1995, vide letter Annexure C1.	None
The assessees representative appeared before the Assessing Officer on 27th November, 1995 but the Assessing Officer adjourned the case to 1st December, 1995.	None
On 1st December, 1995 there was a discussion between the representative of the assessee and the Assessing Officer.	None
The assessee was called upon to make clarifications regarding various points and was also asked to clarify as to how the depreciation as claimed should not be disallowed and why interest should not be taxed as receipt on the revenue account.	None
It is contended by the assessee that the Assessing Officer was in the midst of the proceedings under Section 143(3) of the Act.	None
However, Assessing Officer issued intimation order under Section 143(1)(a) of the Act, vide Annexure D, rejecting the return of income as computed by the assessee resulting in disallowing depreciation as claimed and by taxing the interest income of Rs.1,07,85,590 as income from other sources and thus raised the demand of Rs. 1,30,83,741 under various heads and sections of taxes, surcharge and additional tax under Sections 143(1A), 234A and 234B. Mr. Shah, learned counsel appearing for the assessee, has contended that once the Assessing Officer has exercised option to proceed under Section 143(3) of the Act by issuing notice under Section 143(2) of the Act even if adjustments that may be made by the Assessing Officer are in order, Assessing Officer has forfeited the authority to act under Section 143(1) by virtue of his option having exercised to make an assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act by issuing a notice under s. 143(2) of the Act.	None
As against this, Mr. Shelat, learned counsel (for the Revenue), has contended that it is open for the AO to follow the procedure under s. 143(1) and 143(2) simultaneously.	None
His contention is that it is open to have parallel proceedings and is not compulsory to assess as per s. 143(3) of the Act though notice under s. 143(2) of the Act is issued and before making assessment under s. 143(3) of the Act he can proceed under s. 143(1) of the Act.	None
No other contention is raised.	None
8.1.1	None
The relevant provision, namely Section 143 as it then stood was quoted in paragraph 6 as under It would be better to have a look at the relevant section which is reproduced as under 143(1)(a) Where a return has been made under Section 139, or in response to a notice under subs.	None
(1) of Section 143,  If any tax or interest is found due on the basis of such return, after adjustment of any tax deducted at source, any advance tax paid and any amount paid otherwise by way of tax or interest, then, without prejudice to the provisions of subs.	None
(2), an intimation shall be sent to the assessee specifying the sum so payable, and such intimation shall be deemed to be a notice of demand issued under Section 156 and all the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly If any refund is due on the basis of such return, it shall be granted to the assessee Provided that in computing the tax or interest payable by, or refundable to the assessee, the following adjustments shall be made in the income or loss declared in the return, namely  any arithmetical errors in the return, accounts or documents accompanying it shall be rectified any loss carried forward, deduction, allowance or relief, which, on the basis of the information available in such return, accounts or documents, is prima facie admissible but which is not claimed in the return, shall be allowed any loss carried forward, deduction, allowance or relief claimed in the return, which, on the basis of the information available in such return, accounts or documents, is prima facie inadmissible, shall be disallowed.	None
Provided further that where adjustments are made under the first proviso, an intimation shall be sent to the assessee, notwithstanding that no tax or interest is found due from him after making the said adjustments Provided also that an intimation for any tax or interest due under this clause shall not be sent after the expiry of two years from the end of the assessment year in which the income was first assessable	None

the income declared by any person in the return is increased or the loss declared by such person in the return is reduced or is converted into income, The Assessing Officer shall,  (A) in a case where the increase in income under subclause (i) of this clause has increased the total income of such person, further increase the amount of tax payable under subsection (1) by an additional incometax calculated at the rate of twenty per cent on the difference between the tax on the total income so increased and the tax that would have been chargeable had such total income been reduced by the amount of adjustments and specify the additional incometax in the intimation to be sent under subclause (i) of clause (a) of sub section (1) (B) in a case where the loss so declared is reduced under subclause (i) of this clause or the aforesaid adjustments have the effect of converting that loss into income, calculate a sum (hereinafter referred to as additional incometax) equal to twenty per cent of the tax that would have been chargeable on the amount of the adjustments as if it had been the total income of such person and specify the additional incometax so calculated in the intimation to be sent under subclause (i) of clause (a) of subs.

Where a return has been made under Section 139, or in response to a notice under subs.	None
(1) of Section 142, the AO shall, if he considers it necessary or expedient to ensure that the assessee has not understated the income or has not computed excessive loss or has not underpaid the tax in any manner, serve on the assessee a notice requiring him, on a date to be specified therein, either to attend his office or to produce, or cause to be produced there, any evidence on which the assessee may rely in support of the return Provided that no notice under this subsection shall be served on the assessee after the expiry of twelve months from the end of the month in which the return is furnished.	None
On the day specified in the notice issued under subsection (2) or as soon afterwards as may be, after hearing, such evidence as the assessee may produce and such other evidence as the AO may require on specified points, and after taking into account all relevant material which he has gathered, the AO shall, by an order in writing, make an assessment of the total income or loss of the assessee, and determine the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment.	None
Where a regular assessment under subsection (3) of this section or Section 144 is made  (a) any tax or interest paid by the assessee under subsection (1) shall be deemed to have been paid towards such regular assessment (b) if no refund is due on regular assessment or the amount refunded under subsection (1) exceeds the amount refundable on regular assessment, the whole or the excess amount so refunded shall be deemed to be tax payable by the assessee and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly 8.1.2 Thereafter, the issue was considered thus It is thus clear that the Assessing Officer even after issuing intimation after making adjustments as per provisions of s. 143(1) of the Act can call upon (2) ANR.)	None
26 the assessee, if he considers it necessary or expedient to ensure that the assessee has not understated the income or has not computed excessive loss or has not underpaid the tax in any manner.	None
Once this opinion is formed then the Assessing Officer will have to serve on the assessee a notice under Section 143(2) of the Act requiring him to produce evidence before him on the date specified in the notice.	None
This is permissible in view of saving clause in Section 143(1) of the Act.	None
Section 143(1) of the Act is to be exercised without prejudice to the provisions of subs.	None
(2) of Section 143 of the Act.	None
However, exercise of powers under Section 143(1) is not made permissible after issuance of notice under Section 143(2) of the Act.	None
The Assessing Officer cannot exercise powers under Section 143(1) of the Act as he himself has decided to make regular assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act.	None
That in Section 143(2) like under Section 143(1) powers are not saved.	None
As the Assessing Officer has called upon the assessee to furnish evidence to satisfy himself about the correctness or legality of the claim made by the assessee in his return, hence, only after hearing the assessee and after considering the evidence that may be produced by the assessee the Assessing Officer has to make the order in writing making assessment of the total income or loss of the assessee and he has to determine the amount payable on the basis of such assessment, that is, under s. 143(3) of the Act.	None
Mr. Shelat, learned counsel for the Revenue, fairly stated that notice under Section 143(2) of the Act cannot be withdrawn.	None
Notice under Section 143(2) of the Act is a step towards regular assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act and, therefore, in absence of any provision it is not open to make assessment in any other manner than provided as per Section 143(3) of the Act.	None
Powers to make assessment in terms of its proviso can be invoked and when the claim is prima facie inadmissible or prima facie admissible, as the case may be, adjustment is to be made.	None
The word prima facie clearly indicates that it must be first evidenced.	None
A decision on the debatable issue is not envisaged.	None
Issuance of notice under s. 143(2) of the Act suggests that the Assessing Officer has determined to make assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act.	None
It is clear, looking to the language used in different subsections that order under Section 143(1) is a summary one and the Assessing Officer on perusal of the return, that is, computation of income, is able to accept it as it is or with necessary adjustments as indicated in subclause (a) of subsection (1) of Section 143 of the Act.	None
The submission made by learned counsel for the Revenue is that even after issuance of notice under Section 143(2) of the Act, it is permissible for the Assessing Officer to assess under Section 143(1) of the Act.	None
One has to examine the claim on account of results of adjustments made in the income shown in the return whether it results into increase or loss declared in the return is reduced or is converted into income.	None
If that is so it would entail further tax at the rate of 20 on the income so increased or a further tax of 20 on the loss so reduced as if it is income and assessee will be charged as per subsection (1A) of Section 143 of the Act.	None
With a view to see that taxpayers in the return furnish details with accuracy and correctness this provision is made.	None
The assessee is aware about the provision and should take care that no incorrect statement is made with a view to save additional tax which may be imposed on him.	None
However, when the Assessing Officer is not assessing the correctness about the claim which is either prima facie admissible or prima facie inadmissible, and Assessing Officer with a view to ensure that the assessee has not computed excessive loss or has not underpaid tax in any manner has issued notice under Section 143(2) of the Act, then there should be evidence before him and on the basis of the evidence that may be produced by the assessee assessment is to be made under Section 143(3) of the Act, and assessee will be liable to the tax in the manner laid down in the Act if he is required to pay.	None
After calling upon the assessee to produce evidence if the Assessing Officer is sending intimation instead of making regular assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act then in that case the Assessing Officer would assess and would charge tax as per Section 143(1A) of the Act which is not contemplated under Section 143(3) of the Act and thus what is not permissible under Section 143(3) of the Act cannot be made permissible by allowing the Assessing Officer to resort to Section 143(1) of the Act.	None
In this view of the matter, we are of the opinion that after issuance of notice under Section 143(2) of the Act, it is not open for the Assessing Officer to make adjustment or to pass order under Section 143(1) of the Act but he has to make assessment in accordance with law, i.e., under Section 143(3) of the Act.	None
These decisions were rendered in the context of the provisions then in existence which had following notable features (a) subsection (1A) in terms of which, if any adjustments had resulted in increased total income, an additional income tax at the rate of 20 per cent on the difference would be levied.	None
(b) the intimation to be sent under subsection (1) was expressly stated to be without prejudice to the provision of subsection (2).	None
Nonetheless, the basic distinction that was noted was the procedure under subsection (1) was summary in nature whereas that under subsection (2) was a regular assessment.	None
Section 143 of the Act has since then undergone considerable change.	None
Subsection (1) stands modified and now specifies with clarity the nature of adjustments.	None
Subsection (1A) contemplates processing of returns through Centralized Processing.	None
Since we are principally concerned in the present matter with the effect and applicability of sub section (1D), the legislative history relating to said subsection (1D) is dealt with in detail hereunder Subsection (1D) was inserted vide Finance Act, 2012 as under (1D)	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section (1), the processing of a return shall not be necessary, where a notice has been issued to the assessee under subsection (2) The explanatory Note to the Finance Act, 2012 relevant to the proposed insertion of subsection (1D) was Under the existing provisions, every return of income is to be processed under subsection (1) of Section 143 and refund, if any, due is to be issued to the tax payer.	None
Some returns of income are also selected for scrutiny which may lead to raising a demand for taxes although refunds may have been issued earlier at the time of processing.	None
It is therefore proposed to amend the provisions of the Income Tax Act to provide that processing of return will not be necessary in a case where notice under subsection (2) of Section 143 has been issued for scrutiny of the return.	None
Finance Act, 2016 contemplated substitution of subsection (1D) and insertion of a proviso with effect from 01.04.2017 as follows (1D)	None

This amendment takes effect from the 1 st of April, 2017 and will, accordingly apply in relation to assessment year 201718 and subsequent years.	None
The aforementioned substitution of subsection (1D), however, never came into effect, as by Finance Act, 2017 said subsection in the earlier form was retained and the text of the proviso was also modified.	None

Reasoning
The concerned explanatory Note to Finance Act, 2017 was Processing of return within the prescribed time and enable withholding of refund in certain cases.	None
59.1	None
Before amendment by the Finance Act, 2016, the provisions of subsection (1D) of Section 143 of the Income Tax Act specify that the processing of a return shall not be necessary, where a notice has been issued to the assessee under subsection (2) of the said section.	None
59.2	None
The said subsection was amended vide Finance Act, 2016 and it was provided that with effect from assessment year 201718, processing under Section 143(1) of the Income Tax Act is to be done before passing of assessment order.	None

In order to address the grievance of delay in issuance of refund in genuine cases, a proviso has been inserted in Section 143(1D) of the Income Tax Act specifying that the provisions of the said sub section shall cease to apply in respect of returns furnished for assessment year 201718 and onwards.	None
59.4	None
However, to address the concern of recovery of revenue in doubtful cases, a new section 241A has been inserted in the Income Tax Act to provide that, for the returns furnished for assessment year commencing on or after 1 st April, 2017, where refund of any amount becomes due to the assessee under Section 143(1) of the Income Tax Act and the Assessing Officer is of the opinion that grant of refund may adversely affect the recovery of revenue, he may, for the reasons recorded in writing and with the previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, withhold the refund up to the date on which the assessment is made.	Reasoning
59.5 Applicability	None
These amendments take effect from 1 st April, 2017 and accordingly apply to returns furnished for assessment year 201718 and subsequent years.	None
Finance Act, 2017 also inserted Section 241A in the Act as under 241A. Withholding of refund in certain cases  For every assessment year commencing on or after the 1 st day of April, 2017 where refund of any amount becomes due to the assessee under the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 143 and the Assessing Officer is of the opinion, having regard to the fact that a notice has been issued under subsection (2) of Section 143 in respect of such return, that the grant of the refund is likely to adversely affect the revenue, he may, for reasons to be recorded in writing and with the previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, as the case may be, withheld the refund up to the date on which the assessment is made.	Reasoning
Consequently, the relevant parts of subsections (1) to (3) of Section 143 of the Act, as they stand today are as under Assessment.(1) Where a return has been made under Section 139, or in response to a notice under subsection (1) of Section 142, such return shall be processed in the following manner, namely (a) the total income or loss shall be computed after making the following adjustments, namely any arithmetical error in the return an incorrect claim, if such incorrect claim is apparent from any information in the return disallowance of loss claimed, if return of the previous year for which set off of loss is claimed was furnished beyond the due date specified under subsection (1) of Section 139 disallowance of expenditure indicated in the audit report but not taken into account in computing the total income in the return disallowance of deduction claimed under Sections 10AA, 80IA, 80IAB, 80IB, 80IC, 80ID or Section 80IE, if the return is furnished beyond the due date specified under subsection (1) of Section 139 or addition of income appearing in Form 26 AS or Form 16A or Form 16 which has not been included in computing the total income in the return Provided that no such adjustments shall be made unless an intimation is given to the assessee of such adjustments either in writing or in electronic mode Provided further that the response received from the assessee, if any, shall be considered before making any adjustment, and in a case where no response is received within thirty days of the issue of such intimation, such adjustments shall be made Provided also that no adjustment shall be made under subclause (vi) in relation to a return furnished for the assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 2018 (b) the tax, interest and fee, if any, shall be computed on the basis of the total income computed under clause (a) (c) the sum payable by, or the amount of refund due to, the assessee shall be determined after adjustment of the tax, interest and fee, if any, computed under clause (b) by any tax deducted at source, any tax collected at source, any advance tax paid, any relief allowable under an agreement under Section 90 or Section 90A, or any relief allowable under Section 91, any rebate allowable under Part A of Chapter VIII, any tax paid on selfassessment and any amount paid otherwise by way of tax, interest or fee (d) an intimation shall be prepared or generated and sent to the assessee specifying the sum determined to be payable by, or the amount of refund due to, the assessee under clause (c) and (e) the amount of refund due to the assessee in pursuance of the determination under clause (c) shall be granted to the assessee Provided that an intimation shall also be sent to the assessee in a case where the loss declared in the return by the assessee is adjusted but no tax, interest or fee is payable by, or no refund is due to him Provided further that no intimation under this subsection shall be sent after the expiry of one year from the end of the financial year in which the return is made.

Reasoning
Where a return has been furnished under Section 139, or in response to a notice under subsection (1) of Section 142, the Assessing Officer or the prescribed incometax authority, as the case may be, if, considers it necessary or expedient to ensure that the assessee has not understated the income or has not computed excessive loss or has not underpaid the tax in any manner, shall serve on the assessee a notice requiring him, on a date to be specified therein, either to attend the office of the Assessing Officer or to produce, or cause to be produced before the Assessing Officer any evidence on which the assessee may rely in support of the return Provided that no notice under this subsection shall be served on the assessee after the expiry of six months from the end of the financial year in which the return is furnished.

Such adjustments are in the nature of arithmetical error in the return incorrect claim apparent from any information in the return disallowance of loss if the return of the previous year with respect to which such loss is claimed was furnished beyond the due date disallowance of expenditure indicated in the audit report if it has not taken into account in computing the total income disallowance of deductions specified in subclause if the return is furnished beyond the due date and addition of income as specified in subclause (vi) if it was not included in computing the total income.	None
All these features deal with matters which are apparent from the return and the inconsistency is evident on the face of it.	None
Upon causing such adjustments after due intimation or notice to the assessee, the element of tax, interest and fee is to be computed in terms of clause (b).	None
Thereafter, in terms of clause (c), due credit to the amount of tax paid and any relief that is allowable is to be given and the net amount payable or to be refunded, is to be computed.	None
The intimation to be generated under clause (d) is on the basis of such exercise and if any refund is due, the same has to be granted in terms of clause (e).	None
Thus, at every stage in subsection (1) the return submitted by the assessee forms the foundation, with respect to which, if any of the inconsistencies referred to in various subclauses of clause (a) are found, appropriate adjustments are to be made.	None
On the other hand, the exercise of power under subsection (2) of Section 143 of the Act, leading to the passing of an order subsection (3) thereof, is to be undertaken, where it is considered necessary or expedient to ensure that the assessee has not understated the income, or has not computed excessive loss, or has not underpaid the tax in any manner.	None
The issuance of notice and consequent proceedings are premised on any of the aforesaid three postulates.	None
In other words, the return filed by the assessee itself calls for or requires a further probe and deeper consideration.	None
The guiding principle is to ensure that the income is not understated or the loss is not overstated, or the tax is not under paid in any manner.	None
Upon issuance of notice, the assessee is entitled to produce evidence in support of his case.	None
After hearing the assessee and considering the evidence so produced, by an order in writing, assessment of total income or loss is to be made.	None
The nature of exercise of power under subsection (1) as against that under subsections (2) and (3) is thus completely different.	Reasoning
In the former case, the matter is processed, only to check whether any apparent inconsistencies are evident on the face of the return and connected material which may call for any adjustment while in the latter case, the matter is scrutinized after taking into account such evidence as the assessee may produce.	Reasoning
The exercise in the latter case is to ensure that there is no understating of income or overstating of loss or under payment of the tax in any manner.	Reasoning
In other words, the veracity of the return is checked threadbare rather than considering mere apparent inconsistencies from the return.	Reasoning
Thus, the nature of power under these two provisions, as found by this Court in CIT v. Gujarat Electricity Board (2003) 260	Reasoning
ITR 84 continues to bear the same distinction.	None
The power under subsection (1) of Section 143 of the Act is summary in nature designed to cause adjustments which are apparent from the return while that under subsections (2) and (3) is to scrutinize the return and cause deeper probe to arrive at the correct determination of the liability of the assessee.	Reasoning
The exercise of power under Subsections (2) and (3) of Section 143 of the Act is thus premised on nonacceptance of what is evident from the return itself and to ensure that there is no avoidance of tax in any manner.	Reasoning
The dimension of such power is far greater and deeper than mere adjustments to be made in respect of what is available from the return.	Reasoning
Once such scrutiny is undertaken and proceedings are initiated by issuance of a notice under subsection (2) of Section 143, it would be anomalous and incongruent that while such proceedings so initiated are pending, the return be processed under subsection (1) of Section 143, which may in a given case, entail payment of refund.	Reasoning
Logically, the outcome of the exercise initiated through notice under subsection (2) of Section 143, must determine whether any refund is due and payable.	Reasoning
If the return itself is under probe and scrutiny, such return cannot be the foundation to sustain a claim for refund till such scrutiny is not complete.	Reasoning
Considering the nature of power exercisable under these two limbs of Section 143, the inescapable conclusion is that the processing of return under subsection (1) of Section 143 must await the further exercise of power of scrutiny assessment under subsections (2) and (3) of Section 143.	Reasoning
If the power under subsection (2) of Section 143 of the Act is initiated in a manner known to law, there cannot be any insistence that the processing under subsection (1) of Section 143 be completed and refund be made before the scrutiny pursuant to notice under subsection (2) of Section 143 is over.	Reasoning
The aforestated conclusion is fortified and strengthened by clear stipulation to that effect in subsection (1D) of Section 143.	Reasoning
Irrespective of some change in the text of said provision which was sought to be introduced by Finance Act 2016 and not accepted by Finance Act, 2017, the legislative intent is clear from the expression, the processing of a return shall not be necessary, where a notice has been issued to the assessee under subsection (2) and by use of nonobstante clause.	Reasoning
Though the period for which it would not be necessary to process the return was sought to be specified by Finance Act, 2016, mere absence of such period in the provision as it stands today, makes no difference.	Reasoning
The above quoted portion from the provision and use of nonobstante clause indicate with sufficient clarity the intent of the Parliament that in cases where notice under subsection (2) is issued and proceedings are initiated, the processing of a return under subsection (1) shall not be necessary.	Reasoning
The expression shall not be necessary is used in various statutes and even in the Constitution of India.	None
This expression is used in the first proviso to Article 311(2) and in proviso to Article 320(3) of the Constitution of India.	None
Some of the cases in which similar expression occurring in statutes was taken into account and effect was given to its plain language are Proviso to Section 63(3) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 in Mohd.	None
Ibrahim v. The State Transport Appellate Tribunal, Madras.	None
(1970) 2 SCC 233 .	None
ii) Order XXX Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure in Sohanlal and others v. Amir Chand and sons and others (1973) 2 SCC 608 , Upper India Cable Co. and others v. Bal Kishan (1984) 3 SCC 462 and in Brij Kishore Sharma and others v. Ram Singh and sons and others (1996) 11 SCC 480 .	None
iii) Proviso to Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in Rasammal Issetheerammal Fernandez etc. v. Joosa Mariyam Fernandez and others (2000) 7 SCC 189 .	None
As against the general principle which mandates an action in a particular manner, when an exception is to be carved out, the relevant provisions stipulate it shall not be necessary to adhere to and follow the manner mandated by such general principle and if the contingency contemplated by such exception arises, the general principle is to stand overridden.	None
The intent to have the general principle emanating from sub section (1) of Section 143 overridden, in case where the proceedings are initiated pursuant to notice under subsection (2) of the Act, gets more pronounced and emphasized by use of nonobstante clause in subsection (1D).	None
Recently, while dealing with nonobstante clause in Section 26(1) of the Provincial Small Cause Courts Act, 1887 this Court observed in Vaishali Abhimanyu Joshi v. Nanasaheb Gopal Joshi (2017) 14 SCC 373 as under Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Act as used in Section 26(1) of the 1887 Act are words of expression of the widest amplitude engulfing the contrary provisions contained in the Act.	None
The suit in question has been filed by the plaintiff for enforcement of his right as a licensor after allegedly terminating the gratuitous licence of the appellant.	None
On a plain reading, Item 11 of Schedule II covers determination or enforcement of any such right or interest in immovable property.	None
But by virtue of Section 26 subsection (1) as applicable in the State of Maharashtra, Item 11 of Schedule II has to give way to Section 26(1) and a suit between licensor and licensee which is virtually a suit for recovery of immovable property is fully maintainable in Judge, Small Cause Court that is why the suit has been instituted by the plaintiff in the Judge, Small Cause Court claiming the right and interest in the immovable property.	None
A statutory provision containing non obstante clause has to be given full effect.	None
This Court in Union of India v. G.M. Kokil (1984) Supp.	None
SCC 196 has laid down in para 11 as below (SCC p. 203)	None
It is well known that a non obstante clause is a legislative device which is usually employed to give overriding effect to certain provisions over some contrary provisions that may be found either in the same enactment or some other enactment, that is to say, to avoid the operation and effect of all contrary provisions.	None
Thus the non obstante clause in Section 70, namely, notwithstanding anything contained in that Act must mean notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in that Act and as such it must refer to the exempting provisions which would be contrary to the general applicability of the Act.	None
In the premises, we hold that in respect of Assessment Years ending on 31 st March 2017 or before, if a notice was issued in conformity with the requirements stated in subsection (2) of Section 143 of the Act, it shall not be necessary to process the refund under sub section (1) of Section 143 of the Act and that the requirement to process the return shall stand overridden.	Reasoning
We must now deal with the issue whether any intimation is required to be given to the assessee that because of initiation of proceedings pursuant to notice under subsection (2) of Section 143 of the Act processing of return in terms of subsection (1) of Section 143 of the Act, would stand deferred.	Issue
The processing of return in terms of sub section (1A) of Section 143 of the Act is to be done through centralized processing and as stated earlier, the scope of processing under sub section (1) of Section 143 of the Act is purely summary in character.	None
Once deeper scrutiny is undertaken and the matter is being considered from the perspective whether there is any avoidance of tax in any manner, issuance of notice under subsection (2) itself is sufficient indication.	Reasoning
Subsection (1D) of Section 143 of the Act does not contemplate either issuance of any such intimation or further application of mind that the processing must be kept in abeyance.	Reasoning
It would not, therefore, be proper to read into said provision the requirement to send a separate intimation.	Reasoning
In our view, issuance of notice under subsection (2) of Section 143 is enough to trigger the required consequence.	Reasoning
Any other intimation is neither contemplated by the statute nor would it achieve any purpose.	Reasoning
Consequently, the submission that the intimation dated 23.07.2018 must be held to be invalid, inter alia on the ground that it was issued well after the period within which the return was required to be processed under subsection (1) of Section 143 of the Act, must be rejected.	Reasoning
However, insofar as returns filed in respect of assessment year commencing on or after the 1 st April, 2017, a different regime has been contemplated by the Parliament.	Reasoning
Section 241A of the Act requires a separate recording of satisfaction on part of the Assessing Officer that having regard to the fact that a notice has been issued under subsection (2) of Section 143, the grant of refund is likely to adversely affect the revenue whereafter, with the previous approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner and for reasons to be recorded in writing, the refund can be withheld.	None
Since the statute now envisages exercise of power of withholding of refund in a particular manner, it goes without saying that for assessment year commencing after 01.04.2017 the requirements of Section 241A of the Act must be satisfied.	Reasoning
We will, therefore, have to see whether insofar as AY 201718 is concerned, the order dated 14.03.2019 satisfies the required statutory parameters or not.	Issue
In terms of second proviso to subsection (1) of Section 143 of the Act, the required intimation under said subsection must be given before the expiry of one year from the end of the financial year in which the return is made.	Facts
In respect of AY 201718, the return having been filed on 25.11.2017, period available in terms of said second proviso was upto 31.03.2019, without taking into account the fact that revised return was filed on 13.07.2018.	None
In the present case, the exercise of power on 14.03.2019 was not only after issuance of notice under subsection (2) of Section 143 and after recording due satisfaction in terms of Section 241A of the Act, but was also well within the period contemplated by subsection (1) of Section 143 of the Act for causing due intimation.	None
Whether the satisfaction recorded in terms of said Section 241A of the Act was otherwise correct or not and whether case for withholding of refund was made out or not, are not the issues that arise for our consideration.	None
For the present purposes, whether exercise of power is facially in conformity with the statutory provisions is the issue and we are satisfied that there is nothing in the exercise of power that led to the passing of the order dated 14.03.2019 which could be said to have violated any statutory requirements.	Reasoning
Insofar as AY 201415 is concerned, final assessment order passed under Section 143(3) of the Act indicates that the appellant is entitled to refund of Rs.733 Crores while for AY 201516 there is a demand of Rs.582 Crores.	Reasoning
During the course of hearing, it was suggested on behalf of the respondents that demands in respect of earlier assessment years including the liability as a result of order dated 28.12.2019 as referred to in para 5.1 hereinabove being outstanding, the respondents would be entitled to invoke the requisite power under Section 245 of the Act to set off the amount of refund payable in respect of AY 201415 against tax remaining payable.	Reasoning
Since the requisite action is not even initiated, we say nothing in that respect.	Decision
In the premises, we direct that the amount of Rs.733 Crores shall be refunded to the appellant within four weeks from today subject to any proceedings that the Revenue may deem appropriate to initiate in accordance with law.	Decision
We also direct the respondents to conclude the proceedings initiated pursuant to notice under subsection (2) of Section 143 of the Act in respect of AY 201617 and 201718 as early as possible.	Decision
Except for the directions as indicated above, we see no merit in any of the contentions advanced by the appellant.	Decision
This appeal is, therefore, dismissed without any order as to costs.	Decision
