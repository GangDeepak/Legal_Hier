This appeal by special leave challenges the judgment and order passed by the High Court setting aside the order of allotment dated 15.06.1998.	None
In support of the appeal, Mr. H.P. Raval, learned Senior Advocate submitted that the notices dated 20.03.1998 and 27.03.1998 clearly indicate that requisite opportunity was afforded to Respondent No.1, that record indicated that the cases of all three claimants including that of Respondent No.1 were considered before letter of cancellation dated 09.06.1998 was issued, that cancellation was never challenged by M s Surya Chemicals and that Respondent No.1 had no stateable claim in respect of the concerned shed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Appearing for Respondent No.1, Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned Senior Advocate submitted that in keeping with the direction issued in the judgment and order dated 04.03.1987	Arguments of Respondent
the claim of Respondent No.1 was required to be considered, which is a matter of fact, was not considered at all and that the requirement of the Appellant stood completely satisfied by allotment of two sheds namely C1 and C2 during the pendency of the proceedings.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the submissions and gone through the record.	Reasoning
The Appellant is right in its submissions that requisite notices were issued to Respondent No.1 and that it was afforded adequate opportunity.	Reasoning
The observations of the High Court in that behalf are not quite correct.	Reasoning
The supplementary affidavit filed in January 2000 made the position quite clear.	Reasoning
The petition was therefore wrongly allowed on the ground that no opportunity was given to Respondent No.1.	Reasoning
We have also seen the record and are satisfied that Respondent No.1 had closed its operation in the year 1997.	Reasoning
According to annexure No. R16 placed along with the rejoinder affidavit, an inspection report was apparently prepared.	Reasoning
That report is a solitary piece in support of its submissions of having started manufacturing activity.	Reasoning
Nothing has been placed on record, no licence is adverted to nor is it shown how and in what manner Respondent No.1 started its activity of manufacturing PVC pipes.	Reasoning
Nothing was filed or placed on record pursuant to notices dated 20.03.1998 and 27.03.1998.	Reasoning
We do not find any merit in the submissions that Respondent No.1 has been conducting any activity of manufacturing of PVC pipes.	Reasoning
The claim of Respondent No.1 must therefore be rejected.	Reasoning
At the same time it is absolutely clear on record that the Appellant has been having allotment of three sheds namely B6, C1 and C2 in its favour in the same Industrial Estate.	Reasoning
No special equities are in its favour and no case is therefore made out for allotment of concerned shed to the Appellant.	Reasoning
The observation of the High Court that the order dated 15.06.1998 was issued without any public auction or inviting tenders and as such was completely unsustainable, in our view is absolutely correct.	Reasoning
In the circumstances we allow the present appeal with following directions The claim of Respondent No.1 was rightly rejected while cancelling allotment made in favour of M s Surya Chemicals vide letter of cancellation dated 09.06.1998.	Decision
The order of cancellation dated 09.06.1998 is sustained and shall be fully operative.	Decision
Respondent No.1 who has been in wrongful occupation of the concerned shed must surrender the possession immediately.	Decision
The authorities are directed to recover the possession forthwith and report compliance to this Court.(b)	Decision
In view of the change in circumstances namely allotment of sheds C1 and C2 in its favour, the Appellant is not entitled to claim any special equity.	Decision
The order of allotment dated 15.6.1998 passed in its favour therefore stands set aside.(c)	Decision
The authorities are directed to conduct public auction or invite tenders for allotment of the concerned shed at the present market value.	Decision
Needless to mention that the present Appellant and Respondent No.1 or any other person is free to participate in such public auction or tender.7.	Decision
This appeal thus stands allowed and the judgment of the High Court under appeal stands modified to the aforesaid extent.	Decision
No order as to costs.	Decision
