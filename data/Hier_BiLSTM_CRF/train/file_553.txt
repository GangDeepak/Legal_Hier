It was submitted that the entire action of initiating the acquisition and thereby compelling writ petitioners landholders to divest their valuable and fertile land at throwaway prices under the threat of acquisition to certain private builders and then dropping the acquisition just two days before the date fixed for declaration of award was deliberate and was fraught with malice.(xvi)	Facts

Facts
Further, the escalation of prices in last 20 days namely after the issuance of the notices under Section 9 showed that the builders were not only aware but were also sure that the acquisition would be dropped by the State Government.	Facts
The hike in price was essentially to lure the landholders as after dropping of the acquisition there would be no threat to the landholders.(xxi)	Facts

Facts
Fresh Section 4 notification for 3510 acres was issued on 25.04.2008.24.08.2009 Award in respect of 1128 acres was announced on 21.04.2011.Award of the remaining land was not announced in view of the decision of the Cabinet SubCommittee on infrastructure and explained in paragraph 6 of the reply on merits of the written statement dt. 06.12.2012.	Facts
Thus, in addition to lands covered by said Awards dated 09.03.2006, about 1315 acres of land stood acquired whereas 688 acres of land covered by Declaration under Section 6 of the Act in the present case was dropped from acquisition.	None
It is relevant to note that in relation to acquisition referred to in Column No.5 vide award dated 24.02.2007 (annexed at page307 in the Paper book) compensation was assessed at the rate of Rs. 12.5 lakhs per acre identical to one assessed in Awards dated 09.03.2006.(xxiv)The aforesaid petition as well as connected matters were dismissed by the High Court vide its judgment under appeal.	Facts
It was observed that the landholders had taken no action after their writ petitions were dismissed as infructuous by order dated 09.10.2007 and the present action initiated more than 41/2 years after such dropping of acquisition was wholly belated.	Facts
It was observed It is the case of the petitioners, that they were forced to sell their property under the threat of acquisition to the private respondents and thus the sale deeds so executed by them in their favour, deserved to setaside.	Facts
However we are unable to agree with the said contention raised by the Ld. Counsel for the petitioners as at no stage did the petitioners ever raised hue and cry viz.	None
the said acquisition proceedings.	Facts
Even when the writ petitions were filed by them in the year 2005 impugning the said acquisition proceedings, then also no grievance was raised by them in this regard and in fact during the pendency of these writ petitions, they even sold off their land to the private respondents for consideration and even got sale deeds executed in their favour.	Facts
Even when the said writ petitions were dismissed as infructuous vide order dated 09.10.2007, then also no such distress or grievance was raised by them before this Court.	Facts
Until the filing of the present writ petition, no action much less coercive action was taken by the petitioners against the respondents viz.	Facts
setting aside of the sale deeds on the ground of fraud which thus apparently shows that not only did they acquiesced to the dropping of the said acquisition proceedings by the State Government but also waived off their right to challenge the same as well as the sale deeds executed by them in favour of the private respondents in view of Article 59 of the Limitation Act and thus now at this stage they have no vested or accrued right to challenge the said sale deeds voluntarily executed by them in favour of the private respondents and that too after a long yawning gap of 10 years in view of Section 31 of the Specific Relief Act, for which the present writ petitions being hit by delay and latches cannot be entertained for initiating such an action.	Facts
The Landholders being aggrieved by the decision of the High Court dated 15.12.2014 filed petitions for special leave to appeal in this Court.	Facts
After hearing both sides this Court granted special leave on 06.10.2015 and continued the interim order granted earlier which was to injunct any further construction on the lands in question.	Facts
This Court also recorded the submission of the Counsel for the State that investigation was entrusted to CBI and directed CBI to place its report before this Court, as and when the investigation was over.	Facts
An interim report was filed by CBI in March, 2017.	Facts
On 30.01.2017 Mr. C.A. Sundaram, learned Senior Advocate was appointed Amicus Curiae to assist the Court.	Facts
The subsequent order dated 21.03.2017 records that the CBI had filed its interim report, a copy of which was directed to be given to the learned Amicus Curiae.	Facts
The matters were thereafter taken up for hearing.	Facts
Appearing for the appellants in the lead matter, Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate submitted The licences granted by the State Government to the private builders for development, in the face of the fact that the lands were notified for acquisition, were nothing but an abuse of power and such exercise was directly in breach of the relevant policy.	Arguments of Petitioner
In his submission, the policy dated 19.12.2006 issued by the State Government provided that the licences could be granted where the applicants land owners had applied for licences before the issuance of Notification under Section 4 of the Act and the release could be considered on individual merits of each case.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further submitted that as accepted by the State Government, out of 15 licences granted by the State Government, 8 were granted between the date of issuance of Notification under Section 6 and the date when the acquisition was dropped i.e. on 24.08.2007 and other 7 licences were granted after 24.08.2007.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus all the licences, as a matter of fact, were granted after the issuance of Notification under Section 6 of the Act.(b)	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the purchases made by the builders in the present case were after the lands were notified under Section 4 of the Act on 27.08.2004.	Arguments of Petitioner
At least sixty sale deeds were executed between the issuance of Notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the Act while four sale deeds were executed on the date of declaration under Section 6 i.e. on 25.08.2005 and fifty sale deeds were executed after the issuance of Notification under Section 6 and prior to the dropping of acquisition vide decision dated 24.08.2007.	Arguments of Petitioner
The fact that the builders had enhanced the price and sold the lands at a price of Rs. 80 lakhs and above per acre after the issuance of notice under Section 9, clearly indicated that they were aware that the land acquisition proceedings would be dropped.(c)	Arguments of Petitioner
Though the declared intent while initiating acquisition was to subserve public interest, the State Government kept on granting licences in respect of lands covered under acquisition in the teeth of its relevant policy.	Arguments of Petitioner
A colourable exercise of power was evident and substantiated by the Report dated 26.03.2008 which indicated that 12 licence applications were pending in respect of area aggregating approx.	Arguments of Petitioner
362 acres and that was taken to be good reason to withdraw the lands from acquisition finally.(d)	Arguments of Petitioner
This entire mechanism was deliberately employed so that valuable lands belonging to the landholders could be cornered by a set of builders private entities and after having seen that the desired result was obtained, the acquisition was dropped and later completely withdrawn.(e)	Arguments of Petitioner
Since the entire decision making process was nothing but an abuse of and fraud on power, the landholders were justified in seeking annulment of all the transactions.	Arguments of Petitioner
In his submission, though annulment of transactions can normally be in an action between the vendor and vendee, since the transactions were directly as a result of abuse of and fraud on power, a Writ Court could certainly deal with such issues and while granting relief against such fraud on power, incidental and consequential directions could also be passed annulling such transactions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance was placed on the decisions of this Court in Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority v. Devender Kumar and Others, and in Uddar Gagan v. Sant Singh Others, Learned counsel appearing for other appellants in connected matters adopted the submissions of Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Amicus Curiae initially filed a memo at which stage the interim report of CBI was not filed in Court.	None
After said copy was made available to him pursuant to the Order dated 21.03.2017 he filed three more memos.	None
In his memo dated 28.03.2017 after referring to certain factual aspects as emerging from the interim report of CBI, he submitted  From all the above, it appears that lands were purchased by Builders during acquisition proceedings and also after acquisition proceedings were dropped on the basis that fresh acquisition proceedings would be initiated.	None
It further appears that the builders in the meantime were working to have the acquisition proceedings dropped and their applications for building licenses were also being processed and the issuance of such licenses themselves became a reason for dropping all proceedings.	None
It does not appear anywhere from the record that the sellers of the lands were aware that the acquisition proceedings would be dropped but it has been alleged by them in the writ petition that they were informed of such acquisition proceedings and were therefore, asked to sell their interests.	None
It would appear that rather than running the risk of what the award would amount to and having to contest the matter for the grant of the award, the purchasers transferred their interest to the builders, who on their part, as based on the CBI Report, appear to have used every effort to ensure that the acquisition proceedings were themselves dropped.7.	None
xxx xxx xxx8.	None
In these circumstances, should this Honble Court find that the case of the Petitioners landholders is made out, and that they were in fact fraudulently enticed to sell their lands and there appears to be very suspicious circumstances in which the acquisition proceedings itself was dropped, the following could be considereda.	None
Insofar as the areas where no construction has been made and no third party interests through registered instruments to ultimate purchasers (not other builders) have been created, that the said sales be declared void and the lands restored to the original landholders who be directed to return the monies received by themb.	None
Where third party interests have been created, the builders be directed to disgorge their profit part of their profits on such sales, to be then distributed amongst the original landholders.	None
To arrive at such profit the difference between the purchase price and the sale price less actual cost of construction could be applied.	None
Insofar as plots are concerned, the difference between the buying and selling price could be determinedc.	None
The aforesaid directions could be passed based on the application of Sections 55(5) of the Transfer of Property Act and in particular, Sections 55(5)(a) and 55(6) of the said Act.	None
Such orders could also be passed based on Sections 17(5) read with Section 17(2) and Sections 19 and 65 of the Contract Act(Refer Coaks v. Boswell reported as (1886) IA 232/Summers v. Griffiths reported as (1865) 35 Beavan 27/Mulla on Transfer of Property, 8th Edition, Page 376381 and 407409)d.	None
Apart from these, such reparation could also be made by application of the rule of Unjust Enrichment, which has been recognized as being applicable to cases in the field of equity, contract or tort (Refer Blacks Law Dictionary, 9th Edition Indian Council for Enviro  Legal Action v. Union of India and Others reported as 2011 (8) SCC 161 )e.	None
The Interim Report of the CBI discloses complicity on the part of Government officials in the entire process.	None
In such event, not only would transactions within this entire conspiracy be fraudulent, if they are traced to mala fide exercise of the States power, they would also be against public policy.f.	None
In view of the inordinate increase in the price of land it would not be practical to require the State Government to pay the present consideration or be called upon to acquire these lands and as that would be a drain on the public exchequer.	None
It would perhaps be best to restore status ante insofar as practicable i.e., lands on which constructions have not been made or which have not been plotted and transferred to third party individuals (not builders).	None
In the case of constructions at a nascent stage, it can be determined whether bona fide third party interests have been created and in the absence thereof, status ante could be restored.	None
In the remaining cases, payment of compensation could be directed through payment of consideration to the original landholders as per (b) above.g.	None
The manner in which the amounts could be returned could be in the manner as held by this Honble Court in the case of Uddar Gagan Properties Ltd. v. Sant Singh reported as 2016 (11) SCC 378.	None
h.	None
So far as the conduct of the acquisition proceedings and culpability of persons, government officials and builders in this regard, the CBI may continue its investigation and decide if any action is warranted, and take such action as is found to be necessary.	None
In his memo dated 05.04.2017 it was submitted  Should this Honble Court conclude that there was a fraud in the entire proceedings, it should result in just restitution depending on the Parties involved in the fraud (in pari delicto) and the parties not so involved.2.	None
Should this Honble Court hold that the land owners were not in pari delicto the reliefs as suggested in Memo No. 2 dated 28.03.2017 may be considered.3.	None
Should this Honble Court hold that the land owners were also in pari delicto, the following may be considereda.	None
There were 4 Parties involved in the entire net of transactionsi.	None
The landownersii.	None
The Buildersiii.	None
The Officers of the State andiv.	None
The State itself (as paterfamilias of the public)4.	None
If builders and officers of the State were involved in the fraud and the land owners were in pari delicto, the actual party deceived would be the State and therefore, the beneficiary of any profits arising out of the fraudulent transactions, ought to go to the State to be utilized for a public purpose.5.	None
The manner in which this could be achieved could bea.	None
The recommendation of the HPC dated 26.03.2008 to close the acquisition proceedings and the decision Notification dated 29.01.2010 dropping the acquisition proceedings for the subject properties could be quashedb.	None
Upon quashing of the said Notifications Recommendations, the acquisition proceedings already initiated would resume proprio vigore from the stage where it stood and to that extent would continue to be an acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894c.	None
The period during which the acquisition proceedings stood withdrawn, i.e., 24.08.2007 till the date of this Honble Courts order would be excluded for the purpose of passing of an award and inasmuch as an award was to be declared on 24.08.2007, an award now passed for the said land (in a time bound manner) would be deemed to have been passed on 24.08.2007d.	None
The compensation payable under the said award would be based on the market value of the land in the same manner as if the award was passed on 24.08.2007.e.	None
The said amounts would be deposited and the landholders would be entitled to withdraw the amount representing the difference between what they actually received from the builders and what they were actually awarded.f.	None
The land would thereupon vest in the Stateg.	None
The transferee builders who are the current owners of the land would have a right to seek allotment of the same from the State, consideration for which would be determined at the present days market value or market value as on such other date as this Honble Court may deem fit.	None
Credit would be given to the builders for the amounts that they had paid to the original landholders and which is adjusted in (e) aboveh.	None
In the event that the builders do not wish to purchase the land at such rate, the land may be auctioned by the State andi.	None
Out of the price secured in the auction the amount paid for the acquisition would be deducted.	None
The actual construction costs of any construction made on the lands would also be adjusted and the balance would be retained by the State for use for a public purpose of the area, providing of housing, rehabilitation, etc. by applying the principles of Section 88 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882.	None

Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that the writ petition in the present case was bereft of any material particulars and suffered from nondisclosure of collaboration agreements entered into between the builders and the writ petitioners whereunder certain additional benefits were given to the landholders.	Arguments of Respondent
In his submission, the High Court was justified in dismissing the petition and exemplary costs ought to be imposed on the writ petitioners for embarking on what he termed as adventurous litigation.	Arguments of Respondent
Ms. Indu Malhotra, learned Senior Advocate appearing for respondent Nos. 4  	Arguments of Respondent
M s Metropolis Realtors Pvt. Ltd. and 6  M s Metro Infrastructure Pvt.	Arguments of Respondent

Mr. V. Giri, learned Senior Advocate appearing for respondent No.5  Flair Realtors Pvt.	Arguments of Respondent
Ltd. submitted that each writ petitioner had a separate cause of action and therefore must come out and place his individual case and the facts relevant thereto.	Arguments of Respondent
In his submission in a matter such as the present one, no public law remedy could be invoked and there could be no class action.	Arguments of Respondent
He further submitted that there was total dearth of pleadings and nothing was alleged or proved as regards element of fraud or mala fides so as to vitiate the transactions in entirety.14.	Arguments of Respondent
Dr. A. M. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocate appearing for DLF Home Developers Pvt.	Arguments of Respondent
Ltd. submitted that his client had purchased 33 acres of land not directly from any of the land owners but from respondent No.3 alongwith requisite licences.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, his client purchased the land and the licences when the writ petitions were withdrawn and there was no fetter at all that his client had paid market price at the rate of Rs. 4.5 crores per acre and was bona fide transferee in good faith and that there was no averment either in the High Court or in this Court suggesting that his client was involved in any act of fraud or illegality.	Arguments of Respondent
He further submitted that his client has already transferred the constructed areas or apartments to various purchasers.	Arguments of Respondent
Relying on the decisions of this Court in Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India and Others, where five months delay in preferring writ petition was found to be fatal especially when third party rights had intervened and in State of M.P. and Others v. Nandlal Jaiswal and Others, where eight months delay was found to be fatal where again third party rights had intervened, it was submitted that no case was made out and the view taken by the High Court ought to be affirmed.	Arguments of Respondent
Similar submissions were made by Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Advocate for the same client in a different matter.	Arguments of Respondent
In his submission, if at all any disgorgement as suggested by the learned Amicus Curiae is to be made, it ought to be by respondent No.3 i.e. the client of Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Advocate and not by DLF Home Developers Pvt.	Arguments of Respondent

Mr. Nidhesh Gupta, learned Senior Advocate appearing for Earl Infotech Pvt. Ltd. and for Frontier Infrastructure Developers Pvt. Ltd. made similar submissions.	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that the case in hand was completely different from the fact situation considered by this Court in Uddar Gagan (supra) in as much as neither was there any distress sale by the land owners nor was there any award made under the provisions of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
He further submitted that the entire case set up by the writ petitioners was based on assumptions as to the existence of unjust enrichment and fraud.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Pallav Shishodiya, learned Senior Advocate appearing for Akme Projects Ltd. submitted on similar lines.16.	Arguments of Respondent
Dr. Rajeev Dhawan, learned Senior Advocate appearing for PP Realtors Pvt.	Arguments of Respondent
Ltd. submitted that in an individual case a sale could be invalidated if fraud stood proved on grounds available under the Contract Act, while if sales were sought to be invalidated as a class action then it could only be done on grounds of mala fides in public law.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that fraud in terms of section 17 of the Contract Act had to be transaction based and strictly established.	Arguments of Respondent

State of Haryana, Relevant portion of para 11 of said decision is as under Policy dated 6.1.2000MemorandumMinisterinCharge Town and CountryPlanning MinisterAdministrative Secretary Commissioner and Secretary to Govt.	None
Haryana, Town and Country Planning DepartmentSub Release of land from acquisition where Developers colonizers have purchased land before the issue of notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act but submitted application for licence for commercial colonies thereof afterwards.xx xxx xxx xxxxIt has been felt that apart from providing accommodation for locating commercial officers, a licence for a commercial colony results into receipt of handsome amount to the State Treasury Haryana Urban Development Authority and it will be in public interest to encourage establishment of such colonies.	None
Earlier a decision was taken by the CMM (copy of memorandum and decision is placed at Annexure B and C) to release the land from acquisition where developers colonizers have purchased land before the issue of notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, but submitted applications for grant of licence for setting up of residential colony afterwards.	None
But it is a general decision and it is felt that in view of the reasons explained above, the licences for commercial colonies should be treated differently.	None
It is therefore, proposed that if the department intends to issue licence for commercial colony with the internal concurrence of the Government over a land where the owner had purchased it before the notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued, the release of such land may be allowed before issue of letter of intent.	None
Policy dated 06.03.2000It has also been observed that the resources of HUDA have reduced in the recent past, and acquisition activity and development of residential sectors has become costly and time consuming affair due to litigation and, therefore, it would be appropriate to assign a greater role to private sector.	None
But as per decision taken by the CMM in their meeting held on 30.07.98 even if the department finds that the application for grant of licence for residential colony fulfils policy technical parameters, the land is to be released from acquisition only on the recommendations of the Chief Administrator, HUDA.	None
This results into procedural delay.	None
Since the department of Town and Country Planning, Haryana is responsible for integrated development of urban areas, therefore with a view to avoid procedural delays, it is proposed that on the analogy of decision taken by the CMM on 06.01.2000, the land purchased by the colonizer before issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 where the Director Town and Country Planning, Haryana decides to issue licence for residential colony and obtained the concurrence of the Government for the same, may be released from acquisition.	None
Policy dated 26.10.20075.	None
Any land in respect of which an application under Section 3 of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 has been made by the owners prior to the award for converting the land into a colony, may also be considered for release subject to the condition that the ownership of the land should be prior to the notification under Section 4 of the Act.6.	None
That the Government may also consider release of land in the interest of integrated and planned development for the lands where the owners have approached the Honble Courts and have obtained stay dispossession.	None
Provided that the Government may release any land on the grounds other than stated above under Section 48(1) of the Act under exceptionally justifiable circumstances for the reasons to be recorded in writing From consideration of aforestated statutory framework, it is clear The Regional Plan of 2021, notified on 19.09.2005 contemplated that Master Development Plans in respect of towns were required to be prepared within the framework of said Regional Plan.

The Explanatory Note, as set out hereinabove brings out potential of the lands situate in said Urban Complex.	None

Though the provisions of Haryana Act do contemplate coordination of all efforts with regard to development and implementation of infrastructure, sectors and projects with involvement of private participation, the directions issued by the Government have laid down, in clear terms, the extent and scope of such private participation.	None
In accordance with Section 40 of the NCR Act, the concerned States are expected to give effect to any Regional Plan by taking resort to power of acquisition.	None
The interplay between exercise of such power of acquisition and private participation by permitting licences to owners colonizers was a matter dealt with by Policy Guidelines issued by the Government from time to time.	None
In terms of policy statements dated 07.08.1991, 06.01.2000 and 06.03.2000 where applicants had applied for licence or had acquired land but could not apply for licence before the issue of acquisition notification, release of land could still be considered on individual merits of each case.	Arguments of Petitioner
The scope got further restricted by policy statement of 19.12.2006, in terms of para 5 whereof, if the applicants landholders had applied for licence before the issue of acquisition notification under Section 4 of the LA Act, release of land could be considered on individual merits of each case.	None
As this policy was given effect from 07.06.2005, it could possibly be stated that the earlier policies ought to apply to cases before 07.06.2005.	None
But in any case, for said policies dated 07.08.1991, 06.01.2000 and 06.03.2000 to apply, the purchase by applicants had to be before the issue of acquisition notification.	None
Same thought was expressed in the Policy dated 26.10.2007, that the ownership of the land should be prior to the notification under Section 4 of the Act.	None
Further, the extent of such participation ought to be in terms of zonal requirements set out in Annexure B to the Final Development Plan dated 05.02.2007.	None
It must be noted at the outset that the aforementioned Policy dated 06.03.2000 was considered by this Court in Uddar Gagan (supra) and in paragraph 21 of its judgment, this Court had observed, the policy is applicable only to release of such land from acquisition as is owned purchased by the developers before the issue of notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.	None
This condition was required to be strictly complied with and no person other than original owners prior to acquisition could directly or indirectly avail of the said policy.	None
In the present case, notification under Section 4 of the Act was issued on 27.08.2004.	None
After considering various objections made under Section 5A of the Act, the requirement of 688 Acres of land was assessed and declaration under Section 6 to that effect was issued on 25.08.2005.	None
The material placed on record by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Advocate shows that all lands purchased by his client were after the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similarly para 18 of the interim report submitted by CBI shows that over 444 Acres of land was purchased by various builders private entities after such notification under Section 4 of the Act.	None
Going by the relevant policies holding the field and the law laid down by this Court in para 21 of its judgment in Uddar Gagan (Supra), such purchases did not entitle the concerned builders private entities to prefer any application for licence, nor could pendency of such applications be taken as a relevant factor while arriving at a decision whether acquisition initiated pursuant to notification dated 27.08.2004 be proceeded further or not.	None
However, the record indicates that such purchases and the pendency of applications for licence under the Haryana Act, was a factor which did weigh while decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 were taken.	None
A factor which ought to have been discarded in terms of the declared policy statements, became the fulcrum for said decisions.	None
We have therefore, no hesitation in holding that said decisions are inconsistent with and opposed to relevant policy statements.	None
We also reject the submission advanced on behalf of builders private entities that these decisions were consistent with the Regional Plan under the NCR Act and the Final Development Plan for GurgaonManesar.	None
But the issues raised in the present case go way beyond mere invalidity or illegality of those decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010.	Issue
What is being projected is that those decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 were part of a well devised and designed attempt to deprive the landholders and enrich builders private entities, which would broadly depend upon answers to the following questions a Whether the transactions entered into between the landholders and the concerned builders private entities in the present case could be said to be voluntary and free from any influence.b Whether the decisions on part of the state machinery arrived at on 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 could be said to be guided by considerations other than those for which the power was conferred or in other words was there a fraud on power.	Issue
Before we deal with the aforesaid issues, certain crystalized facets of the matter as evident from facts as narrated above and the statutory framework, need to be noted The concerned lands fall in National Capital Region to which the provisions of Regional Plan, 2021 prepared under the NCR Act and Final Development Plan for GurgaonManesar Urban Complex prepared by Government of Haryana do apply.	None
The Explanatory Note set out in Annexure A to said Final Development Plan brings out the potential of the lands in GurgaonManesar and acknowledges its proximity with Delhi, locational advantages and importance of said lands.(b)	None
Though Regional Plan, 2021 and Final Development Plan for GurgaonManesar Region Complex were notified on 19.09.2005 and 05.02.2007 respectively, it can well be assumed that stages anterior to preparation and notification of said plans coincided with the initiation of acquisition in the present case.	None
In any case, the potential of said lands was not something which arose out of the blue for the first time in 2007 and it can safely be inferred that such potential was to the knowledge of everybody concerned.(c) All the transactions in the present case under which the builders private entities purchased the lands, were entered into after the initiation of acquisition on 27.08.2004.	None
As disclosed in the material placed on record by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Advocate, his client alone had purchased more than 235 acres of land while as per interim report of CBI, an extent of 444 acres of land was purchased by builders private entities after the initiation of acquisition.	None
Thus, substantial portion of land out of 688 acres of land as specified in declaration under Section 6 of the Act was purchased by builders private entities.(d)	None
Around the time when those purchases were made by builders private respondents, Awards were declared on 09.03.2006 and 24.02.2007 in respect of lands from adjoining Villages where the acquisition was also initiated for the same public purpose.	None
The compensation awarded was at the rate Rs. 12.5 lakhs per acre.(e)	None
Although the relevant policies did not permit anyone who purchased the concerned lands after initiation of acquisition to prefer an application for licence, the builders private entities merrily went about purchasing the interest of concerned landholders after such initiation.	None
Most of these companies were incorporated after the acquisition was initiated and had no experience in colonization.	None
Yet substantial and sizeable holding was purchased by them.	None
This is reflective of the intent to cash in on an opportunity made available and garner as much holding as possible.	None
The subsequent transactions of sale by them are also indicative of the attempts to profiteer in the matter rather than any bona fide attempt to develop and colonize the property.(f)	None
Faced with impending acquisition initiated on 27.08.2004, the landholders were persuaded to enter into transactions with builders private respondents.	None
The Tabular Chart as set out by way of example in paragraph 8 hereinabove shows that the average price was initially in the region of Rs. 25 lakhs per acre which rose to L40 lakhs per acre or above after the issuance of declaration under Section 6 of the Act.	None
The price so received was greater than the rate awarded in Awards dated 09.03.2006 and 24.02.2007.(g)	None
Notices under Section 9 of the Act were issued by the Authorities on 02.08.2007 calling upon the landholders to appear for pronouncement of award on 26.08.2007.	Facts
The record indicates that the price paid by the builders private entities just before 24.08.2007 was in the region of Rs. 80 lakhs per acre.	None
This further discloses, as rightly submitted by Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate that builders private entities were aware that the award would not be declared but the land acquisition proceedings would be dropped.(h)	None
At least 60 sale deeds were executed between the issuance of Notifications under Sections 4 and 6 of the Act, four sale deeds were executed on the day the declaration under Section 6 was issued and 50 sale deeds were executed after the issuance of Notification under Section 6 and prior to the dropping of acquisition on 24.08.2007.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus about 114 sale deeds were executed after the initiation of acquisition and prior to the dropping of acquisition vide decision dated 24.08.2007.(i)	None
The sale deeds in favour of the builders private entities do not even mention the factum about the issuance of any Notification under Section 4 of the Act, nor any urgency or necessity for the family to dispose of its holdings find any specific clear mention.	None
The sales in question were effected only because of impending acquisition.(j)	None
The material placed on record by Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Advocate discloses a disturbing feature.	None
The lands which were purchased for a price ranging from Rs. 25 lakhs per acre soon after the initiation of acquisition which price rose to Rs. 80 lakhs per acre just before dropping of the acquisition, were finally purchased by DLF Home Developers Ltd. at the rate of Rs.	None
41/2 crores per acre.	None
Further, the fact that settlement money at the rate of Rs.	None
31/2 crores per acre was made over to entities which apparently had done nothing in the matter is quite shocking.	None
Neither had these entities procured the lands from the original landholders nor were they ultimate developers who wanted to develop the property.	None
Such entities can certainly be termed as middle men who walked away with tremendous amount of money or benefit at the rate of Rs.	None
31/2 crores per acre.	None
Was that a mere bonanza or a deal denoting quid pro quo?(k)	None
It is true that the price of Rs.	None
41/2 crores per acre was paid in respect of land as well as the licences and well after the dropping of the acquisition and withdrawal of writ petitions pending in the High Court.	None
However this price or the rate shows the tremendous difference between the return received by the original landholders and the actual potential of the land.(l)	None
In terms of paragraph VIII of Annexure B to the Final Development Plan for GurgaonManesar Urban Complex the extent of private participation was extremely limited and in terms of relevant policy under the Haryana Act no licence could be issued in case any purchase of land was made after the initiation of the acquisition.	None
Yet the concerned Authorities not only entertained such applications for licence but pendency of such applications was taken as a factor for withdrawal from acquisition.	None
Something which ought to have been rejected and discarded outright became the foundation for decision in favour of builders private entities.(m)	None
The interim report of CBI in para 21 indicates that objection was taken by HSIIDC and it was prayed that application for licence be rejected.	None
Going by aforesaid paragraph VIII of Annexure B and the relevant policy, such application could never have been entertained but it was so done favourably.	None
In cases where the power conferred under the provisions of the Act was utilized to favour a private person or entity, this Court has always come down heavily.	None
In Uddar Gagan (supra) which was relied upon by Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate and the learned Amicus Curie, the question which arose for consideration inter alia, was whether the power of the State to withdraw from acquisition under Section 48 of the Act after the award had been passed, was utilized to facilitate transfer of title of the land of original owners to a private builder to advance the business interest of the builder.	None
In that case, the builder had purchased the interest of the original landholders after the acquisition was initiated like in the present case and at his instance the lands were released from acquisition at which stage the original landholders had invoked writ jurisdiction and challenged the entire action.	None
The High Court set aside the release orders, quashed the acquisition and went on to direct that the lands be restored to the original landowners.	None
While considering the matter in an appeal at the instance of the builder, this Court dealt with the observations of the High Court in Paragraph 5.	None
Paragraphs 70 and 80 of the High Court judgment which were inter alia quoted by this Court were as under To say that the landowners entered into varied contracts with Respondent 11 voluntarily, willingly or without undue pressure is too farcical to be believed.	None
There is a natural and conventional bondage between the land and its tiller.	None
A farmer seldom sells the land save for the compelling reasons.	None
Agriculture being their only source of survival, the loss of land is a terrible nightmare for any farmer.	None
The Land Acquisition Collectors never assess the compensation as per actual market value of the land and the only yardstick to be followed is the Collectors rate fixed for the purpose of registration charges.	None
The farmer cannot sell the land in open market as on issuance of Section 4 notification all sale transactions are invariably banned.	None
These moments of fear and anxiety must have prompted Respondent 11 to indulge in the best bargain.	None
For the farmers the offer was like better you give the wool than the whole sheep.	None
There was no free trade for the farmers.	None
Their choice was limited to accept the State compensation at the Collectors rate or a better offer given by Statesponsored private builder.	None
There was inequality of bargaining power.	None
The determination of land value was not at all in the control of farmers.	None
They were groping in the dark.	None
They had no clue that the land will be released.	None
They accepted the unreasonable and unfair unilateral terms and lost their land.80.	None
Secondly, it is not a case of challenging the sale deeds for the breach of any bilateral terms and conditions or on the conventional grounds where a question of fact has to be proved.	None
The incidental relief to declare the sale deeds as null and void is an offshoot of the broader issues raised by the petitioners including those hovering around the systematic colourable exercise of power by the State apparatus.	None
A constitutional court while performing its solemn duty as a trustee of the fundamental rights of the citizens shall thus be well within its right to lift the veil and unmask the private object behind an acquisition carried out in disregard to the mandate of Articles 14 and 300A of the Constitution.	None
This Court affirmed the view taken by the High Court as regards quashing of release orders but upheld the acquisition and awards.	None
It further directed that the lands in question vested in State free from all encumbrances.	None
In the context of the present case, the following observations of this Court in Uddar Gagan (supra) in paragraphs 18, 19, 22 and 23 are quite crucial 18.	None
entertaining an application for releasing of land in favour of the builder who comes into picture after acquisition notification and release of land to such builder tantamounts to acquisition for a private purpose.	None
It amounts to transfer of resources of poor for the benefit of the rich.	None
It amounts to permitting profiteering at the cost of livelihood and existence of a farmer.	None
This is against the philosophy of the Constitution and in violation of guaranteed fundamental rights of equality and right to property and to life.	None
What cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly also.19.	None
It is patent that the State has enabled the builder to enter the field after initiation of acquisition to seek colonisation on the land covered by acquisition.	None
In the absence of the States action, it was not possible for the builder to enter into the transactions in question which was followed by withdrawal from acquisition.22.	None
When the land sought to be acquired for a public purpose is allowed to be transferred to private persons, any administrative action or private transaction could be held to be vitiated by fraud.23.	None
Fraud on power voids the action of the authority.	None
Mala fides can be inferred from undisputed facts even without naming a particular officer and even without positive evidence.	None
For the present purposes, contents of paragraphs 29 and 30 of the decision in Uddar Gagan (supra) and the directions issued in paragraph 33 are extracted Once release of land under acquisition is found to be mala fide or arbitrary exercise of power, acquisition of released land stands revived.	None
The operative direction of the High Court to quash the acquisition to the extent it has neither been challenged nor concerns the land transferred to a private builder by abusing the power of acquisition or on account of any extraneous considerations does not appear to be justified.	None
Similarly the direction of permitting the builder to retain the land of those landowners who are not able to refund the sale consideration received by them may permit the builder to illegally retain the land.	None
Moreover, it may not be practicable in the present fact situation to restore the land to the landowners but they can be duly compensated while restoring the land to the State to use it for notified public purpose.	None
Person whose land is taken for houses for others cannot be rendered homeless and unemployed.	None
This will be sheer exploitation.	None
In view of the conduct of the builder, agreeing with the view of the High Court, we do not propose to allow any interest to the builder while permitting refund reimbursement to it.	None
From the impugned judgment there is nothing to show that the developments which are now relied upon had taken place on the date of filing of the writ petition.	None
It has been specifically held in para 89 of the impugned judgment that no development had taken place till the judgment of the High Court.	None
Any subsequent transactions or development are of no consequence for rights of parties.	None
Any subsequent transactions entered into by the builder cannot be taken into account and are hit by the principle of lis pendens.	None
In any case it was for the builder to inform the third parties to whom the plots have been sold, that the land was under litigation.	None
If the third parties have purchased the land knowing fully about the litigation, they have clearly taken risk and their remedy will be only against the builder.	None
If pendency of litigation was suppressed, the third parties can take their remedies against the builder.	None
Without prejudice to their said private remedies, the court may try to balance equities to the extent possible.	None
We are also of the view that if the authorities have proceeded to entertain applications for licence to give undue benefit to the builder by way of helping him to take over land under the cloud of acquisition, it may call for action against those who have misused their power and to find out the considerations for such misuse.30.	None
Land is scarce natural resource.	None
Owner of land has guarantee against being deprived of his rights except under a valid law for compelling needs of the society and not otherwise.	None
The commercial use of land can certainly be rewarding to an individual.	None
Initiation of acquisition for public purpose may deprive the owner of valuable land but it cannot permit another person who may be able to get permission to develop colony to take over the said land.	None
If the law allows the State to take land for housing needs, the State itself has to keep the title or dispose of land consistent with Article 14 after completion of acquisition.	None
If after initiation of acquisition, process is not to be completed, land must revert back to owner on the date of Section 4 notification and not to anyone else directly or indirectly.	None
This is not what has happened33.	None
Keeping the above in mind, we are of the view that ends of justice will be served by moulding the relief as follows33.1.	None
Notifications dated 1142002, 842003 and awards dated 642005 are upheld.	None
The land covered thereby vests in HUDA free from all encumbrances.	None
HUDA may forthwith take possession thereof.33.2.	None
All release orders in favour of the builder in respect of land covered by the award in exercise of powers under Section 48 are quashed.33.3.	None
Consequently, all licences granted in respect of the land covered by acquisition will stand transferred to HUDA.33.4.	Decision
Sale deeds other agreements in favour of the builder in respect of the said land are quashed.	None
The builder will not be entitled to recover the consideration paid to the owners but will be entitled to reimbursement as indicated hereinafter.	None
Creation of any thirdparty rights by the builder also stands quashed.33.5.	None
The sale consideration paid by the builder to the landowners will be treated as compensation under the award.	Decision
The landowners will not be required to refund any amount.	None
The landowners who have not received compensation will be at liberty to receive the same.	None
The landowners will also be at liberty to prefer reference under Section 18 of the 1894 Act within a period of three months, if such reference has not been earlier preferred.33.6.	Decision
The builder will be entitled to refund reimbursement of any payments made to the State, to the landowners or the amount spent on development of the land, from HUDA on being satisfied about the extent of actual expenditure not exceeding HUDA norms on the subject.	Decision
Claim of the builder will be taken up after settling claim of third parties from whom the builder has collected money.	None
No interest will be payable on the said amount.33.7.	None
The third parties from whom money has been collected by the builder will be entitled to either the refund of the amount, out of and to the extent of the amount payable to the builder under the above direction, available with the State, on their claims being verified or will be allotted the plots at the price paid or price prevalent, whatever is higher.	Decision
No interest will be payable on the said amount.33.8.	None
The State shall give benefit of Rehabilitation and Resettlement of Land Acquisition Oustees policy of the State HUDA to the landowners.	None
Area so required shall be reserved out of the acquired land itself.33.9.	Decision
The State Government may enquire into the legality and bona fides of the action of the persons responsible for illegally entertaining the applications of the builder and releasing the land to it, when it had no title to the land on the date of the notification under Section 4 of the 1894 Act and proceed against them in accordance with law.33.10.	None
This judgment be complied with within one year.33.11.	None
Quarterly progress report of the action taken in pursuance of this judgment be filed by the State in this Court and final report of compliance may be filed within one month after expiry of one year from today for such further direction as may become necessary.	None
Apart from the decisions of this Court in Uddar Gagan (supra) following decisions of this Court are noteworthy a	None
In Collector (DM) v. Raja Ram Jaiswal, it was observed by this Court Where power is conferred to achieve a purpose it has been repeatedly reiterated that the power must be exercised reasonably and in good faith to effectuate the purpose.	None
And in this context in good faith means for legitimate reasons Where power is exercised for extraneous or irrelevant considerations or reasons, it is unquestionably a colourable exercise of power or fraud on power and the exercise of power is vitiated.	None
If the power to acquire land is to be exercised, it must be exercised bona fide for the statutory purpose and for none other.	None
If it is exercised for an extraneous, irrelevant or nongermane consideration, the acquiring authority can be charged with legal mala fides.	None
In such a situation there is no question of any personal illwill or motive.	None
In Municipal Council of Sydney v. Campbell, it was observed that irrelevant considerations on which power to acquire land is exercised, would vitiate compulsory purchase orders or scheme depending on them b	None
In Royal Orchid Hotels Limited and Another v. G. Jayarama Reddy and Others, , this Court was called upon to consider question whether land acquired by the State Government for specified purpose namely GolfcumHotel Resort could be transferred to a private individual.	None
The observations in paragraph 38 are relevant for the present purposes The courts have repeatedly held that in exercise of its power of eminent domain, the State can compulsorily acquire land of the private persons but this proposition cannot be overstretched to legitimize a patently illegal and fraudulent exercise undertaken for depriving the landowners of their constitutional right to property with a view to favour private persons.	None
It needs no emphasis that if land is to be acquired for a company, the State Government and the company is bound to comply with the mandate of the provisions contained in Part VII of the Act.	None
Therefore, the Corporation did not have the jurisdiction to transfer the land acquired for a public purpose to the companies and thereby allow them to bypass the provisions of Part VII.	None
The diversification of the purpose for which land was acquired under Section 4(1) read with Section 6 clearly amounted to a fraud on the power of eminent domain.	None
This is precisely what the High Court has held in the judgment under appeal and we do not find any valid ground to interfere with the same c	None
In Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority v. Devendra Kumar and Others,, validity of acquisition of about 156 hectares of land and subsequent transfer of acquired land to the builders and whether such transfer was colourable exercise of power came up for consideration of this Court.	None
In paragraph 43 this Court quoted the observations of Krishna Iyer J in State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh, and later made following observations in paragraph 49	None
In this context, it will be useful to notice the observations made in State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh.	None
In that case, while pronouncing upon the correctness of the order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court which had quashed the acquisition of the respondents land on the ground of mala fide exercise of power, this Court observed (SCC p. 475, para 9)9.	None
Legal malice is gibberish unless juristic clarity keeps it separate from the popular concept of personal vice.	None
Pithily put, bad faith which invalidates the exercise of power sometimes called colourable exercise or fraud on power and oftentimes overlaps motives, passions and satisfactionsis the attainment of ends beyond the sanctioned purposes of power by simulation or pretension of gaining a legitimate goal.	None
If the use of the power is for the fulfilment of a legitimate object the actuation or catalysation by malice is not legicidal.	None
The action is bad where the true object is to reach an end different from the one for which the power is entrusted, goaded by extraneous considerations, good or bad, but irrelevant to the entrustment.	None
When the custodian of power is influenced in its exercise by considerations outside those for promotion of which the power is vested the court calls it a colourable exercise and is undeceived by illusion.	None
In a broad, blurred sense, Benjamin Disraeli was not off the mark even in law when he statedI repeat that all power is a trustthat we are accountable for its exercisethat, from the people, and for the people, all springs, and all must exist.	None
Fraud on power voids the order if it is not exercised bona fide for the end designed.	None
Fraud in this context is not equal to moral turpitude and embraces all cases in which the action impugned is to effect some object which is beyond the purpose and intent of the power, whether this be maliceladen or even benign.	None
If the purpose is corrupt the resultant act is bad.	None
If considerations, foreign to the scope of the power or extraneous to the statute, enter the verdict or impel the action, mala fides or fraud on power vitiates the acquisition or other official act Before concluding, we consider it necessary to reiterate that the acquisition of land is a serious matter and before initiating the proceedings under the 1894 Act and other similar legislations, the Government concerned must seriously ponder over the consequences of depriving the tenureholder of his property.	None
It must be remembered that the land is just like mother of the people living in the rural areas of the country.	None
It is the only source of sustenance and livelihood for the landowner and his family.	None
If the land is acquired, not only the present but the future generations of the landowner are deprived of their livelihood and the only social security.	None
They are made landless and are forced to live in slums in the urban areas because there is no mechanism for ensuring alternative source of livelihood to them.	None
Mindless acquisition of fertile and cultivable land may also lead to serious food crisis in the country.	None
The decisions referred in the preceding paragraphs were delivered in the context of exercise of power under the provisions of the Act.	None
In addition, there are few other decisions which were rendered in other fields but considered the issues regarding fraud on power notable amongst them being S. Pratap Singh v. The State of Punjab, Express Newspapers Pvt.	None
Ltd. and others v. Union of India and others, and observations by R.M. Sahai J in Shrisht Dhawan (Smt) v. Shaw Bros., The issue concerning unjust enrichment was dealt with by this Court very succinctly in Indian Council for EnviroLegal Action v. Union of India, as under Unjust enrichment has been defined asUnjust enrichment.	None
A benefit obtained from another, not intended as a gift and not legally justifiable, for which the beneficiary must make restitution or recompense.	None
See Blacks Law Dictionary, 8th Edn.	None
(Bryan A. Garner) at p. 1573.	None
A claim for unjust enrichment arises where there has been an unjust retention of a benefit to the loss of another, or the retention of money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience.152.	None
Unjust enrichment has been defined by the court as the unjust retention of a benefit to the loss of another, or the retention of money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience.	None
A person is enriched if he has received a benefit, and he is unjustly enriched if retention of the benefit would be unjust.	None
Unjust enrichment of a person occurs when he has and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.153.	None
Unjust enrichment is the unjust retention of a benefit to the loss of another, or the retention of money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience.	None
A defendant may be liable even when the defendant retaining the benefit is not a wrongdoer and even though he may have received it honestly in the first instance.	None
(Schock v. Nash, , A 2d, 23233.)154.	None
Unjust enrichment occurs when the defendant wrongfully secures a benefit or passively receives a benefit which would be unconscionable to retain.	None
In the leading case of Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v. Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd., , Lord Wright stated the principle thus (AC p. 61)	None
Any civilised system of law is bound to provide remedies for cases of what has been called unjust enrichment or unjust benefit that is to prevent a man from retaining the money of or some benefit derived from another which it is against conscience that he should keep.	None
Such remedies in English law are generically different from remedies in contract or in tort, and are now recognised to fall within a third category of the common law which has been called quasicontract or restitution.155.	None
Lord Denning also stated in Nelson v. Larholt, as under (KB p. 343)	None
It is no longer appropriate, however, to draw a distinction between law and equity.	None
Principles have now to be stated in the light of their combined effect.	None
Nor is it necessary to canvass the niceties of the old forms of action.	None
Remedies now depend on the substance of the right, not on whether they can be fitted into a particular framework.	None
The right here is not peculiar to equity or contract or tort, but falls naturally within the important category of cases where the court orders restitution, if the justice of the case so requires.156.	None
The above principle has been accepted in India.	None
This Court in several cases has applied the doctrine of unjust enrichment159.	None
Unjust enrichment is basic to the subject of restitution, and is indeed approached as a fundamental principle thereof.	None
They are usually linked together, and restitution is frequently based upon the theory of unjust enrichment.	None
However, although unjust enrichment is often referred to or regarded as a ground for restitution, it is perhaps more accurate to regard it as a prerequisite, for usually there can be no restitution without unjust enrichment.	None
It is defined as the unjust retention of a benefit to the loss of another or the retention of money or property of another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience.	None
A person is enriched if he has received a benefit, and he is unjustly enriched if retention of the benefit would be unjust.	None
Unjust enrichment of a person occurs when he has and retains money or benefits which in justice and equity belong to another.160.	None
While the term restitution was considered by the Supreme Court in South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. v. State of M.P., and other cases excerpted later, the term unjust enrichment came to be considered in Sahakari Khand Udyog Mandal Ltd. v. CCE Customs,.	None
This Court said (Sahakari Khand case, SCC p. 748, para 31)31.	None
unjust enrichment means retention of a benefit by a person that is unjust or inequitable.	None
Unjust enrichment occurs when a person retains money or benefits which in justice, equity and good conscience, belong to someone else.161.	None
The terms unjust enrichment and restitution are like the two shades of greenone leaning towards yellow and the other towards blue.	None
With restitution, so long as the deprivation of the other has not been fully compensated for, injustice to that extent remains.	Reasoning
Which label is appropriate under which circumstances would depend on the facts of the particular case before the court.	None
The courts have wide powers to grant restitution, and more so where it relates to misuse or noncompliance with court orders.	None
As held in State of Punjab v. Gurdial Singh (Supra) when a custodian of power is influenced in its exercise by considerations outside those for promotion of which the power is vested, such exercise is nothing but colourable exercise of power and that the power of the State to acquire lands of private persons compulsorily cannot be overstretched to legitimize a patently illegal and fraudulent exercise undertaken to favour certain private persons.	None
This principle has been followed consistently.	None
While dealing with fact situation arising in the context of exercise of power under the provisions of the Act and its interplay with the power under the provisions of the Haryana Act and the concerned policies, the observations of this Court in the decision in Uddar Gagan (supra) are crucial.	None
They cull out principles that entertaining an application for releasing of land in favour of a builder who came into picture after acquisition had been initiated amounts to transfer of resources of poor for the benefit of the rich and that no legitimacy can be conferred to an abuse of power to advance such purpose.	None
Further, mala fides could be inferred from undisputed facts even without naming a particular officer.	None
But the salutary principle discernable from Uddar Gagan (supra) lies in the relief granted by this Court in paragraph 33.	None
This Court agreed with the High Court that there was fraud on power but did not sustain the relief of return of lands to the landholders.	None
The real victim of abuse of power or fraud on power was public interest for furtherance of which the acquisition was sustained and appropriate directions were passed.	None
This Court therefore severed that part which was found to be bad but sustained acquisition to subserve public interest.	None
If we consider the established or crystallized facets of the matter as stated above, in the light of the principles emerging from the decisions rendered by this Court, in our considered view the decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 were taken to confer advantages and benefits upon the builders private entities rather than to carry out or effectuate public purpose.	Reasoning
The record indicates that various entities including certain middlemen cornered unnatural gains and walked away with huge profits taking the entire process of acquisition for a ride.	Reasoning
Substantial sums have exchanged hands in the form of settlement money.	Reasoning
All the steps and stages show that the builders private entities were well aware that the acquisition would not go through but the landholders were confronted with the smoke screen of acquisition and were cornered and persuaded in entering into transactions with the builders private entities.	Reasoning
The transactions so entered into between the landholders and the concerned builders private entities could not be said to be voluntary and free from any influence.	Reasoning
The unnatural and unreasonable bargain was forced upon the landholders by creating faade of impending acquisition.	Reasoning
Public Interest was not the underlying concern or objective behind those decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 but the motive was to confer undue advantage on the builders private entities.	Reasoning
It is clear that considerations other than those which were required to be bestowed, guided the exercise of power in arriving at decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010.	Reasoning
The inescapable conclusion, therefore, is that there was an unholy nexus between the governmental machinery and the builders private entities in devising a modality to deprive the innocent and gullible landholders of their holdings and jeopardize public interest which the acquisition was intended to achieve.	Reasoning
Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate is right in his submission that the entire mechanism was deliberately employed so that gullible landholders could be deprived of their holdings by a set of builders private entities and after having seen that the desired result was achieved, the acquisition was dropped and later completely withdrawn.	Reasoning
The decisions on the part of the State arrived at on 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 were clearly a result of fraud on power and cannot be said to be bona fide exercise of power.	Reasoning
In our view, the initiation of class action and filing of Writ Petition in the present matter was perfectly justified and we reject all the submissions made by the learned Counsel appearing for various builders private entities.32.	Reasoning
We thus hold that a The transactions entered into between the landholders and the concerned builders private entities in the present case were not voluntary and were brought about by fraudulent influence.	Reasoning
Certain middlemen and builders enriched themselves at the expense of the landholders and public interest which was to be achieved by acquisition.b	Reasoning
The decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 as well as entertaining of applications for grant of licence from those who had bought the lands after the acquisition was initiated, were not bona fide exercise of power by the State machinery.	Reasoning
The exercise of power under the Act was guided by considerations extraneous to the provisions of the Act and as a matter of fact, was designed to enrich the builders private entities.	Reasoning
These decisions were nothing but fraud on power.	Reasoning
Having so found that the exercise of power in arriving at decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 as well as entertaining of applications for licence from those who had bought the lands after the acquisition was initiated, to be fraud on power we now have to consider what relief be granted in the present matter.	Reasoning
The relief to be granted must depend upon who the real victim is and to what extent solace can be granted to such real victim.	Reasoning
If the landholders are considered to be the real victim, Mr. Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate is absolutely right in his submissions.	Reasoning
If the result of forcing land holders to enter into unnatural and unreasonable bargain was achieved by wrongful utilization of the power conferred under the Act, in its writ jurisdiction a superior court would be justified in granting the relief of invalidating such transaction as a consequential relief, while holding the State action to be bad and invalid.	Reasoning
The law laid down by this Court is quite clear and the objection that instead of a class action in the realm of public law, each individual land holder must make good his submissions on individual facts and seek relief of annulment of transaction entered into by him has to be rejected.	Reasoning
To the extent the unnatural and unreasonable bargain was forced upon the landholders, there would be justification in granting such relief.	Reasoning
But in the circumstances, the public interest which the acquisition was intended to achieve will never be sub83 served.	Reasoning
It is nobodys case that public interest was adequately achieved and therefore the acquisition was required to be dropped.	Reasoning
The fact that other acquisitions have been completed and have attained the required objective is a pointer in the direction that there was nothing wrong with the initiation but somewhere along while the process was on, it was completely hijacked by vested interests.	Reasoning
We cannot, therefore, grant mere declaration invalidating the transaction and grant relief of restoring status ante.	Reasoning
The real and substantial relief would be in restoring the situation where the process of acquisition is made free from such supervening vested interests and is enabled to achieve the objective that the acquisition was intended to subserve.34.	Reasoning
At this stage an aspect needs elaboration and clarification.	Reasoning
In Uddar Gagan (supra) the proceedings for acquisition under the Act had culminated in passing of an award.	Reasoning
After the declaration of award, the lands were withdrawn from acquisition under the provisions of Section 48 of the Act.	Reasoning
In terms of the directions issued by this Court in paragraph 33 in Uddar Gagan (supra) the withdrawal under Section 48 of the Act was set aside and the acquisition and award were sustained by this Court.	Reasoning
In essence therefore, the lands in question continued to be under acquisition and appropriate directions were thereafter passed by this Court adjusting the competing claims of the concerned parties.	Reasoning
In the present case, unlike Uddar Gagan (supra) the acquisition was dropped just two days before the day the award was to be pronounced.	Reasoning
It is true that the entire process right upto publishing the date for pronouncement of award was validly undertaken, every possible submission was placed on record and all contentions were taken by the persons or parties interested.	Reasoning
It was not as if any person or any party was denied any chance of raising objections or making submissions.	Reasoning
The acquisition was dropped for reasons, which in our considered view were not germane at all and the entire exercise of dropping the acquisition was fraud on power.	Reasoning
If that fraud on power is to be invalidated, the real and substantial restoration would be to ensure that the acquisition proceeds in the logical direction and the public purpose is subserved.	Reasoning
In a way, the directions required in the present matter may go beyond what Uddar Gagan (supra) did.	None
In certain cases this Court, considering typical fact situation has passed directions to complete the process of acquisition, for instance In Bhimandas Ambwani (Dead) through Lrs.	None
v. Delhi Power Company Limited, it was found, there had been no proceedings regarding acquisition of the land in dispute.	None
However, as the authorities had taken over possession of the land and developed the same, this Court observed In such a fact situation, the only option left out to the respondents is to make the award treating Section 4 notification as, on this date i.e. 12.02.2013 and we direct the Land Acquisition Collector to make the award after hearing the parties within a period of four months from today.	None
In K.B. Ramachandra Raje Urs(Dead) by L.Rs.	None
v. State of Karnataka and Others, having held that the acquisition and allotment of 55 acres of land to respondent No.28 Society to be contrary to law, it was noted that a fullfledged campus had come up in an area admeasuring 40 acres of land out of said 55 acres.	None
It was therefore observed Insofar as the remaining 40 acres of land allotted to Respondent 28 is concerned, we direct that compensation, in respect thereof, to the person persons entitled to receive such compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, will follow the outcome of Writ Appeal No.1654 of 2008.	None
The compensation under the Act will be paid by taking the date of the order of the learned Single Judge of the High Court i.e. 2222001.	None
Thus, in cases where there was no valid acquisition but the land was taken possession of and developed, restoration of land to the landholders was not found to be the appropriate, adequate and complete relief and this Court directed that process of acquisition be initiated taking or treating certain date to be the relevant date for initiation of the acquisition.	None
If the power can go to the extent of directing acquisition in such manner, in a case where an acquisition having been properly and validly initiated if the supervening circumstances show that there was complete fraud on power in dropping the acquisition, can the power of the superior court not extend to not be extended for passing appropriate directions to complete the acquisition and subserve the public interest.	None
But for such fraud on power, the matter in the present case was ripe for pronouncement of award when the acquisition was dropped just two days before the date of pronouncement.	None
All the steps leading to the publication of date for pronouncement of award having been validly and correctly undertaken, can a direction not be passed that there was a deemed award and completed acquisition.	None
Wherever there has been fraud on power, the duty of the Court is not only to set aside such exercise of power but to see that there is no unjust enrichment directly or indirectly as a result thereof and there is full and substantial restoration.	Reasoning
Going by the principles laid down by this Court in Indian Council for EnviroLegal Action (Supra) unjust retention of benefit would be completely against the fundamental principles of justice, equity and good conscience.	Reasoning
It was observed therein that so long as the deprivation of a party has not been fully compensated for, injustice to that extent continues.	Reasoning
Having found that there was a clear case of fraud on power as a result of which unnatural and unreasonable gains have been derived by certain builders private entities, we consider it our duty to grant full restitution.	Reasoning
The restoration in real and substantial terms has to ensure that the public purpose, the acquisition was intended to achieve, stands subserved.	None
In our considered view, this is an appropriate case where this Court has to declare that there was a completed acquisition and the award deemed to have been passed on the date when it was supposed to be pronounced i.e. on 26.08.2007.	None
The suggested relief by the learned Amicus Curiae is also on similar lines.	None
There are certain other elements which need attention at this stage.	None
The Act now stands replaced by The Right of Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.	None
In terms of Section 24(1)(b) of said 2013 Act, where an award had been made under Section 11 of the Act, the proceedings under the provisions of the Act would continue as if the Act had not been repealed.	None
Thus, even if a direction is passed that an award be deemed to have been made on 26.08.2007, the provisions of the Act would still continue to operate in respect of such acquisition in question.	None
There is however, one point which may pose some difficulty.	None
Out of 688 acres of land which was covered by Declaration under Section 6 of the Act in the present matter, majority of the lands were taken over by builders private entities and as such presently the concerned landholders are not in possession of their holdings.	None
However, in case of certain other lands where no transactions were entered into, as a result of dropping of the acquisition, those land holders are presently in occupation without there being any cloud of acquisition.	None
If we restore status ante where the entirety of 688 acres of land continues to be under acquisition, the interest of such landholders is bound to be put to some prejudice.	None
Those landholders are not parties to this litigation, nor their interest in any manner, is represented in the proceedings.	None
They would now be visited with the prospect of losing their holdings.	None
Those who sold away their holdings to the builders private entities after the acquisition was initiated, naturally would not be prejudiced at all nor can the builders private entities who purchased the land after the land was initiated can put up a plea of prejudice.	None
However those who had never sold the holdings and continued to face the prospect of acquisition will certainly be put to prejudice.	None
It is possible that some such landholders may have sold away their holdings or may have applied and secured licences for construction.	None
In cases, where third party interests have thus intervened, there would be some more concern.	None
The relief to be granted in the matter has therefore to take care of all the aforesaid aspects.	None
On one hand, the real and substantial relief to be granted in the matter would be not just restoring the status ante and invalidating of the transactions but the relief ought to be that the process of acquisition is taken to its logical end and the objective that said acquisition was to achieve must be subserved.	None
On the other hand, even while passing appropriate directions in the nature that there was a deemed Award, the interest of those landholders who had not parted with their holdings and had faced the acquisition and had not participated in the proceedings ought to be secured.	None
Further, the interest of purchasers of individual apartments is also required to be protected.	None
It is axiomatic that wherever a superior Court finds that the exercise of power by the executive was mala fide or that there was fraud of power, the full and substantial relief must be granted.	None
The principles of restitution and concept of unjust enrichment as explained in cases referred to hereinabove show that no person who directly or indirectly was a party to the fraud of power be allowed to reap or retain any unjust enrichment.	None
Though, it is through the acts on part of the landholders that the builders private entities were brought on the scene, we dont hold them to be pari delicto alongwith builders private respondents.	Reasoning
But at the same time they cannot be given benefit of annulment of transactions and restoration of their holdings.	Reasoning
The greater victim in the matter was the public interest.	Reasoning
The land holders in any case had received considerations which were greater than what was awarded in Awards dated 09.03.2006 and 24.02.2007, which were the most proximate awards in terms of time.	Reasoning
However, even when we propose to take the matter to its logical end and say that there was a deemed award, those who had not sold away their holdings and had not in any manner either directly or indirectly, tried to jeopardize the process of acquisition, cannot at this length of time be subjected to any prejudice.	Reasoning
We will therefore have to exclude that body of landholders who had not transferred their holdings unlike the writ petitioners and similarly situated landholders, so also the purchasers of individual apartments from the width of our directions.	Reasoning
Though fraud vitiates every resultant action and on that principle every beneficiary purchaser in subsequent transaction must restore such benefit, an exception has to be made in favour of individual purchasers of flats or apartments who are being left undisturbed while moulding the relief.	Reasoning
Any payments made by them can be adjusted towards the amounts payable to the colonizer and their possession can be regularized by HUDA HSIDC on suitable conditions by making allotment to them.	Reasoning
This aspect will stand covered by directions issued hereafter.39.	Reasoning
Having bestowed our attention to various competing elements and issues we deem it appropriate to direct(a)	Decision
The decisions dated 24.08.2007 and 29.01.2010 referred to hereinabove are set aside as being brought about by mala fide exercise of power.	Decision
In our considered view, those decisions were clear case of fraud on power and as such are annulled.(b)	Decision
The decision dated 24.08.2007 was taken when the matters were already posted for pronouncement of the award on 26.08.2007.	Decision
Since all the antecedent stages and steps prior thereto were properly and validly undertaken, and since the decision dated 24.08.2007 has been held by us to be an exercise of fraud on power, it is directed that an Award is deemed to have been passed on 26.08.2007 in respect of lands (i) which were covered by declaration under Section 6 in the present case and (ii) which were transferred by the landholders during the period 27.08.2004 till 29.01.2010.	Decision
The lands which were not transferred by the landholders during the period from 27.08.2004 till 29.01.2010 are not governed by these directions.(c)	Decision
Subject to the directions issued hereafter, the lands covered under aforementioned direction (b) shall vest in the HUDA HSIDC, as may be directed by the State of Haryana, free from all encumbrances.	Decision
HUDA HSIDC may forthwith take possession thereof.	Decision
Consequently all licences granted in respect of lands covered by the deemed Award dated 26.08.2007 will stand transferred to HUDA HSIDC.(d)	Decision
Since the dropping of acquisition on 24.08.2007 and subsequent decision dated 29.01.2010 have been set aside, the period between 24.08.2007 and upto the date of this judgment shall not be counted for the purposes of Section 24(2) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.(e)	Decision
All transactions entered into during the period from 24.08.2007 till 29.01.2010, pursuant to which the original landholders transferred their holdings in favour of builders private entities or third parties shall be subject to and the interest of the respective parties shall be governed by the directions issued hereafter.(f)	Decision
Consistent with directions issued in Para 33 of Uddar Gagan (Supra), the builders private entities will not be entitled to recover the consideration paid by them to the landholders.	Decision
The sale consideration paid by the builders private entities to the landholders shall be treated towards compensation under the award and the landholders will not be required to refund any amount to such builders private entities.	Decision
The landholders will be at liberty to prefer Reference under Section 18 of the Act within a period of three months from today.	Decision
For the purposes of maintaining such Reference the reasoning that weighed while passing Awards dated 09.03.2006 and 24.02.2007 shall be the basis.	Decision
If the Reference Court were to enhance the compensation, the amounts received by the landholders by way of consideration from the builders private entities shall be appropriated towards such sum awarded by the Reference Court.	Decision
If the landholders are still entitled to something more than what they had received from the builders private entities, the differential sum shall be made over to them by the State of Haryana towards acquisition of their interest in the lands in question.	Decision
If however, what the landholders had received towards consideration from the builders private entities is found to be in excess of what is awarded by the Reference Court, the remainder shall not be recovered from them.(g)	Decision
Consistent with the directions issued by this Court in Paragraphs 33.6 and 33.7 in Uddar Gagan (supra), the builders private entities will be entitled to refund reimbursement of any payment made to the landholders or the amounts that had been spent on development of the land, such payments shall be made by HUDA or HSIDC on being satisfied about the extent of actual expenditure not exceeding HUDA or HSIDC norms on the subject as the case may be.	Decision
Refund will however be in respect of amount at which the landholders sold the land and not of subsequent sales.	Decision
As regards subsequent transactions, the subsequent purchasers will have remedies against their respective vendors.	Decision
Claims of builders private entities entitled to refund will be taken up after settling claims of third parties from whom the builders private entities had collected monies.	Decision
No interest will be payable on such amounts.(h)	Decision
The third parties from whom money had been collected by the builder private entities will either be entitled to refund of the amount from and out of and to the extent of the amount payable to the builder private entities in terms of above direction, available with the State, on their claims being verified or will be allotted the plots or apartments at the agreed price or prevalent price, whichever is higher.	Decision
Every such claim shall be verified by HUDA or HSIDC.	Decision
In cases where, constructions have been erected and the entire project is complete or is nearing completion, upon acceptance of the claim, the plots or apartments shall be made over to the respective claimants on the same terms and conditions.	Decision
Except for such verified and accepted claims, the remaining area or apartments will be completely at the disposal of HUDA or HSIDC, as the case may be, which shall be free and competent to dispose of the same in accordance with the prevalent policy and procedure.	Decision
In order to facilitate such exercise all third parties who had purchased or had been allotted the plots or apartments shall prefer claims within one month from today, which claim shall be verified within two months from today.	Decision
As found by us in the preceding paragraphs, substantial sums were made over to middle men.	None
In the pending investigation, the CBI may do well to unravel the truth.	None
In any case, such hefty sums which were made over to middle men cannot be said to be rightfully earned by and belonging to them.	None
In fact, this actually represents the return for being able to garner the lands in question and getting requisite licences under the provisions of the Haryana Act and a benefit derived out of fraud on power.	None
In our view this money rightfully belongs to the State and none other.	None
We direct the authorities of the State as well as the Central Government to reach the depths of such transactions and recover every single pie and make it over to the State Government.	None
A complete investigation in the transactions including unearthing unnatural gains received by middle men shall be undertaken by the CBI.(j) If CBI has filed charge sheet before the concerned Court, the same may be dealt with as per law.(k) The State shall give benefit of Rehabilitation and Resettlement of Land Acquisition Oustees policy of the State HUDA HSIDC to the landholders.	Decision
Area so required shall be reserved out of the acquired land itself.(l)	Decision
The State may revisit its policy of change of land use and giving colonization licence in respect of land which is subject matter of acquisition.(m)	Decision
We are given to understand that a Commission of Enquiry was appointed by the State of Haryana to enquire into certain facts concerning acquisitions in respect of lands in Gurgaon Manesar Urban Complex and that the matter is presently subject matter of challenge in a pending writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana on account of which further steps are held up.	Decision
Without expressing any opinion on the merits or demerits of such challenge, we request the High Court to deal with and dispose of the matter as early as possible and preferably within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order so that public interest may not suffer by delay in such decision.	Decision
Before we close, we must record our sincere appreciation for the efforts put in and for the invaluable assistance rendered by the learned Amicus Curiae.	None
His analytical approach and suggestions have helped us immensely in resolving the issues.	None
The appeals stand allowed in the aforesaid terms.	Decision
There shall be no order as to costs.	Decision
