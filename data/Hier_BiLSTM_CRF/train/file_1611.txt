 S. Sirpurkar, J. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order passed by the High Court, whereby, Sections 47(3) and 47(4) of the Andhra Pradesh Shops Establishments Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Shops Act) are declared unconstitutional, discriminatory and violative of the Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.	Issue
Following facts would be necessary to understand the controversy.	None
Respondent No. 1 M s. Srinivasa Resorts Ltd. is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, while the respondent No. 2 is a shareholder of the said company.	Facts
Respondent No. 1 company is engaged in business of managing and running hotels.	Facts
They have hotel in the name and style of ITC Kakatiya Sheraton, which is being run by the ITC Hotels Ltd., which is another company incorporated under the Companies Act.	Facts
The said hotel is registered under the provisions of the Shops Act.	Facts
The appellant is the Union of employees and workers of the said hotel.	Facts
Assistant Labour Officer, respondent No. 4 herein, visited the hotel at the instance of the appellant Union on 31.5.2001 and as required by him, the respondent Nos. 1 2 furnished information regarding the employees, who had left the service of the hotel during last 23 years, as also the amounts paid to them towards full and final settlement of the dues.	Facts
The respondent company, by letter dated 6.8.2001, also furnished the receipts signed by the employees who had left the hotel in token of the amounts received by them.	Facts
It seems that, thereafter, there was lot of correspondence between the respondent No. 1 company and respondent No. 4 Assistant Labour Officer on the issue, whereby, the Assistant Labour Officer was insisting upon the respondent Company to furnish the final settlement statements of the employees, who had left the service of the hotel, in order to know whether any service compensation had been paid to them or not in accordance with the provisions of the Shops Act.	Facts
It was pleaded by the respondent company that no further documents except those, which were already produced, were available with them.	Facts
However, the Assistant Labour Officer, by his letter dated 7.8.2001, called upon the respondent company to show cause as to why penal action should not be taken under Section 16(3) of the Act for failure to furnish the required documents.	Facts
It is at this juncture that a Writ Petition came to be filed before the Andhra Pradesh High Court by the respondent Nos. 1 2 herein, whereby, constitutional validity of the provisions of Sections 47(3) and 47(4) of the Shops Act in question, was challenged on the ground that they are illegal, invalid, inoperative and unsustainable in law and violative of Article 13, 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.	Facts
Since the action against the respondent company was initiated by the appellant Grand Kakatiya Sheraton Hotel Towers Employees Workers Union (hereinafter referred to as the Union for short), the said Union joined as a party, as the respondent No. 3 to the Writ Petition.	Facts
An injunction was also sought for against the concerned authorities under the Act and more particularly, the State Government and the Assistant Labour Officer, restraining them from inferring the provisions of Sections 47(3) and 47(4) of the Shops Act against the respondent company.	Facts
This Writ Petition was allowed by the High Court, whereby, the High Court declared the two aforementioned provisions as unconstitutional and amounting to unreasonable discrimination and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.3.	Facts
The original respondent No. 3	Facts
Union has filed the present appeal, challenging the impugned judgment.4.	Facts
There was one other appeal being Civil Appeal No. 2746 of 2006, which was attached with the present Civil Appeal No. 6499 of 2002, however, when the matter was called for hearing on 5.11.2008, nobody remained present for arguing that appeal, which was dismissed for nonprosecution with no orders as to the costs.	Facts
We are, therefore, left with Civil Appeal No. 6499 of 2002 only.5.	Facts
Before we note and appreciate the rival contentions, it will be better to see the impugned provisions along with the legislative history thereof.6.	Facts
The Andhra Pradesh Shops and Establishments Act (Act No. 15 of 1966) (hereinafter referred to as the 1966 Act) came on the anvil in the year 1966.	Facts
Section 40 of the 1966 Act provided for conditions for terminating the service of an employee, as also the payment of gratuity to him.	Facts
This provision came to be amended in the year 1976 by reason of Act No. 53 of 1976, however, the said Act was repealed by the present Act of 1988.	Facts
The present Act of 1988 provides for conditions of terminating the services of an employee and payment of service compensation for termination, retirement, resignation etc.	Facts
In short, Section 40 of the 1966 Act and Section 47 of the 1988 Act are parimateria Sections.	Facts
It will be better to compare the unamended Section 40, that existed from 1966 till its amendment in 1976, secondly, the amended Section 40 of the 1966 Act as amended by Act No. 53 of 1976 and Section 47 of the present 1988 Act, more particularly, subSections 3, 4 and 5 thereof, as they stood on the date of petition.

At this juncture, it will be better to see a few provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.	Facts
SubSection (3) of Section 1 provides as under(3)	Facts
It shall apply to(a) every factory, mine, oil field, plantation, port and railway company(b) every shop or establishment within the meaning of any law for the time being in force in relation to shops and establishments in a State, in which ten or more persons are employed or were employed, on any day of the preceding twelve months(c) such other establishments or class of establishments in which ten or more employees are employed, or were employed, on any day of the preceding twelve months, as the Central Government, may, by notification, specifyin this behalf.3A. A shop or establishment to which this Act has become applicable shall continue to be governed by this Act, notwithstanding that the number of persons employed therein at any time after it has become so applicable falls below ten.4.	Facts
Payment of gratuity(1) Gratuity shall be payable to an employee on the termination of his employment after he has rendered continuous service for not less than five years.(a) on his superannuation, or(b) on his retirement or resignation or(c) on his death or disablement due to accident or disease.provided that the completion of continuous service of five years shall not be necessary where the termination of the employment of any employee is due to death or disablement.xxx xxxxxx(2)	Facts
For every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months, the employer shall pay gratuity to an employee at the rate of fifteen days wages based on the rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned provided that in the case of a piecerated employee, daily wages shall be computed on the average of the total wages received by him for a period of three months.	Facts
Immediately preceding the termination of his employment and for this purpose, the wages paid for any over time work shall not be taken into account.	Facts
Section 7 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 provides for the determination of the amount of grautuity.	Facts
Under subSection (1), an eligible employee under the said Act has to make a written application, while subSection (2) makes it binding on the employer to determine the amount of gratuity and specify the same to the controlling authority, even if such application is not made.	Facts
The mandate of subSection (3) is to make the payment of gratuity within 30 days of the date, it becomes payable to such eligible employee.	Facts
Section 3A provides for the interest, where gratuity is not paid within the prescribed period.7.	Facts
The challenge before the High Court was that the impugned provisions of the Shops Act, viz., Sections 47(3) and 47(4) are exfacie unreasonable, since the service compensation is now payable under the same even to the employee, who has resigned or voluntarily left service after attaining the age of 60 years though he had not put in long and continuous service, as required under the Payment of Gratuity Act.	Facts
The further challenge was that the employee becomes entitled to receive wages from the date of termination or cessation of his services till the date he is actually paid the service compensation as per subSection 4 of the Shops Act.	Facts
The respondent company (petitioner before the High Court) urged that this was arbitrary, oppressive, discriminatory and violative of the Article 14 of the Constitution of India.	Facts
It was urged that the employer was forced to pay the service compensation, even though cessation of service in cases of resignation and voluntary cessation after completion of 60 years, was not on account of any act on the part of the employer.8.	Facts
Heavy reliance was placed by the appellant petitioner on the judgment of this Court in Express Newspapers Vs.	Facts
Union of India reported in AIR 1958 SC 578 .9.	Facts
Before the High Court, the State sought to defend the said provisions on the ground that the impugned provisions were made for the payment of extra wages.	Facts
It was urged that the provisions of Sections 47(3) and 47(4) were applicable only to those employees, who were not governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act.	Facts
It was pointed out that the provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act were applicable only to those employees, who had completed minimum of 5 years of service, while the provisions of the impugned subSections (3) and (4) of the Shops Act would be applicable to the employees, who had served even less than 5 years.	Facts
According to State, this was a reasonable classification, having a nexus with the purpose for which the provisions were brought into existence.	Facts
It was stated further that considering objects and reasons of the Shops Act, it was apparent that there was no conflict between the Payment of Gratuity Act and the Shops Act.	Facts
It was also urged that since the number of employees in a shop, governed by the Shops Act could be limited to one or two persons and their services also might not continue for a long period, therefore, in order to help such employees, a special provision was made considering such employees as a separate class.	Facts
Section 47(4) was sought to be saved on the logic that it was nothing, but a concept of Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and on that basis, the said subSection would be constitutionally valid.10.	Facts
The High Court in its judgment firstly found that the respondent company admittedly had not complied with the provisions of subSections (3) and (4) of the Shops Act on the basis of the Reply Affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant petitioner.	Facts
The Court further found on comparison of the provisions of the 1966 Act and 1988 Act that they were almost identical and the payment of gratuity was replaced by the introduction of the concept of service compensation.	Facts
The only change was to extend the minimum requirement period of six months to one year.	Facts
The High Court also found that the establishment of the respondent company was indisputably covered under the Shops Act.	Facts
The High Court thereafter noted that the unamended provisions of Sections 40(1) and 40(3) of the 1966 Act had been challenged earlier before the Division Bench and the same were declared invalid under Article 14 of the Constitution of India on the ground that while in factories which are large in size, the workers, in order to earn the gratuity, would have to render long and meritorious service under a scheme of Payment of gratuity prior to enactment of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, however, the employees working in the nearby office, which is much smaller in its operations, would be entitled to such gratuity on rendering a mere six months of unbroken service.	Facts
The High Court then commented that even when the earlier judgment of the High Court had attained finality, by way of the present amendment only a cosmetic amendment was made.	Facts
The High Court then went on to analyze Section 47 and pointed out that in contrast with subSection thereof, under subSection (3), the amount of service compensation is required to be paid even if the cessation of service is caused not by the employer, but at the instance of the employee.	Facts
It was further noted that in case of termination of an employee due to death or disablement, even the condition of completion of continuous service of one year was not necessary.	Facts
The onerousness of subSection 4 was also noted by the High Court that the employee becomes entitled to be paid the wages from the date of his termination or cessation of his service right until the date of the actual payment of service compensation.	Facts
The High Court also saw the contradictions that the Shops Act was applicable to the administrative offices of the factories and the employees working therein.	Facts
While the employee working in the factory would be eligible for gratuity only after rendering five continuous years of meritorious service, the employees working in the administrative office adjacent to the said factory, would, however, be eligible for service compensation under Section 47(3) by merely rendering one years service.	Facts
The High Court then held that the service compensation was nothing, but a gratuity.	Facts
Considering the meaning of the word gratuity, the High Court found that the service compensation was nothing, but the gratuity, which was payable to the employee as a gift or reward for rendering long and continuous service.	Facts
It also found that a mere service of one year or so could not be viewed as a long and continuous service, so as to entitle the employee to earn the service compensation or in other words, the gratuity.	Facts
The High Court took into consideration the provisions of the Gratuity Act and found that the minimum period of service therein was five years, as also for the Government servants of the State, the minimum qualifying period for earning gratuity was 10 years of service.	Facts
Comparatively, the High Court came to the conclusion that limiting this period of long, continuous and satisfactory service only to one year was unreasonable and discriminatory.	Facts
The High Court also severely commented on the provisions that in case of death or disablement, the condition of completion of one year of service was also not necessary.	Facts
The High Court then relying on the judgment of Bennet Coleman Co. Ltd.	Facts
Vs. Union of India reported in (AIR 1973 SC 106 ), held that to treat unequals equal, would amount to discrimination and held that Section 47(3) had that effect.	Facts
The High Court then referred to the cases in Express Newspapers Vs.	Facts
Union of India (cited supra) and Peerless General Finance And Investment Co.	Facts
Ltd.	Facts
Vs.	Reasoning
R.B.I. reported in (1992 (2) SCC 343 ).	Facts
Thereafter, the High Court considered the scheme of payment of gratuity as required by the Payment of Gratuity Act and observed that Section 4(1)(b) has been held to be a reasonable classification within the meaning of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.	Facts
Referring to number of other decisions, the High Court observed It may be true that having regard to the provisions contained in List III of the VII Schedule of the Constitution, the State can also lay down certain conditions of service.	Facts
But, the same would not mean that smaller units will be burdened with a harsher, oppressive and more onerous statutory obligations than their big brothers.	None
It was found that the same field was being covered by the Central legislation, as well as, the impugned State legislation.	None
The High Court, however, pointed out that merely because the State legislation had received the Presidential assent, that, by itself, could not save the State legislation if it was otherwise discriminatory.	Facts
This observation was made on finding that there existed no evidence that the possible conflict in Central Act and the State Act was brought to the notice of the President before the assent was obtained.	Facts
On the factual aspect, the High Court observed that, in fact, there were number of employees, who had left the service and thereafter, had not been heard for a few years and as such, they could not be said to have rendered any work which would entitle them to receive gratuity or service compensation.	Facts
The High Court ultimately held that those, who had abandoned their services, were not entitled to get any benefits under the impugned provisions.	Facts
Thus, the High Court specifically found the two provisions, viz., 47(3) and 47(4) to be unreasonable.	Facts
These provisions and more particularly, Section 47(4) was found to be contrary to the basic principles of service jurisprudence.	Facts
The High Court ultimately allowed the Writ Petition.	Facts
It is this judgment, which has fallen for our consideration in the present appeal.	Facts
The Learned Counsel for the appellant firstly pointed out that impugned Sections 47(3) and 47(4) are constitutionally valid and suffer from no infirmity.	Arguments of Petitioner
He secondly urged that as has been done by the High Court, the legislation cannot be struck down on the ground of mere hardship.	Arguments of Petitioner
His third contention was that the High Court had resorted to the comparisons between two legislations by two different legislatures while deciding upon the constitutionality of the aforementioned provisions, which was not permissible.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Learned Counsel fourthly urged that merely because the lesser period for the purpose of grant of service compensation was provided, it did not impinge upon constitutionality and it was perfectly permissible for the legislature to prescribe lesser period.	Arguments of Petitioner
Fifthly, the Learned Counsel urged that in the impugned judgment, it was not shown as to how the fundamental rights of the respondent Nos. 1 2 under Article 14 and 19(1)(g) were violated.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Learned Counsel also suggested that the High Court erred in holding that the Presidential assent under Article 254 (2) was inconsequential.	Arguments of Petitioner
Lastly, the Learned Counsel urged that the decision in Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors. reported in (1972(2) ALT 163) was not correctly decided and could not be relied upon for striking down Section 47(3) of the Shops Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri L. Nageshwar Rao, Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent company urged that the High Court had not struck down concerned impugned provisions merely on the ground of hardship.	Arguments of Respondent
He pointed out that the High Court had taken the overall effect of the provisions and had come to conclusion that the provisions were unreasonable and hence, unconstitutional.	Arguments of Respondent
As regards the third contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the appellant, Shri Rao pointed out that the Court had not made any comparisons between two legislations by two different legislatures.	Arguments of Respondent
On the other hand, the Court had found that the basic concept of service compensation or as the case may be, gratuity, was completely abused by Section 47(3), while Section 47(4) was inherently bad, as it was unreasonable and capable of misused.	Arguments of Respondent
The Learned Senior Counsel pointed out that the Court had also pointed out that Section 47(3) was capable of giving different treatment to the two sets of employees, who were similarly circumstanced and, therefore, it was hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India.	Arguments of Respondent
As regards the fourth contention, the Learned Senior Counsel also relied on Bakshish Singh Vs.	Arguments of Respondent
Darshan Engineering Works Ors. reported in (1994 (1) SCC 9 ) and pointed out that the principles on which the gratuity was granted, were completely abused by providing a period of one years service or even lesser period for the entitlement of gratuity or as the case may be, service compensation.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Rao further pointed out that the Court had given good reasons relying on the judgment of Express Newspapers Vs. Union of India (cited supra) and Division Bench judgment in Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Arguments of Respondent
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors.	Reasoning
(cited supra), as also in Bakshish Singh Vs.	Arguments of Respondent
Darshan Engineering Works Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
(cited supra) that the High Court had properly tested the impugned provisions and showed as to how the fundamental rights of the respondent Nos. 1 2 under Article 14 and 19(1)(g) were violated.	Arguments of Respondent
The Learned Senior Counsel pointed out that the finding of the High Court was that there was no evidence placed before it regarding the material placed before the President for obtaining the consent.	Arguments of Respondent
Lastly, the Learned Senior Counsel pointed out that after decision in case of Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Arguments of Respondent
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors.	Reasoning
(cited supra) by the Division Bench of the High Court, striking down Section 47(3) of the Shops Act, mere cosmetic changes were brought about in the fresh legislation, which was impermissible for the legislature.	Arguments of Respondent
We shall collectively consider the arguments.	None
The High Court has quoted from the judgment of this Court in Express Newspapers Vs. Union of India (cited supra), more particularly, from paragraph 205, which is the final verdict of this Court in that case, but before that also, in paragraph 198, it is observed When we come, however, to the provision in regard to the payment of gratuity to working journalists who voluntarily resigned from service from newspaper establishments, we find that this was a provision which was not at all reasonable.	None
A gratuity is a scheme of retirement benefit and the conditions for its being awarded have been thus laid down in the Labour Court decisions in this country.	None
This Court then referred to the case of Workmen employed under the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation Vs.	None
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation reported in (1955 Lab A C 155), as also, the observations made in the case of Indian Oxygen Acetylene Co. Ltd. reported in (19561 Lab L J 435 and observed in paragraph 202) to the following effect It will be noticed from the above that even in those cases, where gratuity was awarded on the employees resignation from service, it was granted only after the completion of 15 years continuous service and not merely on a minimum of 3 years service as in the present case.	None
Gratuity being a reward for good, efficient and faithful service rendered for a considerable period (vide Indian Railway Establishment Code, Vol.	None
I at page 614  Chapter XV, Para 1503), there would be no justification for awarding the same when an employee voluntarily resigns and brings about a termination of his service, except in exceptional circumstances.	None
The Court, thereafter, quoted a passage in relation to Journalists Working Conditions and their Moral Rights, as also from the collective agreement between the Geneva Press Association and the Geneva Union of Newspaper Publishers and ultimately found in paragraph 205 that such provision, providing for a payment of gratuity even to an employee who voluntarily resigns from service after a period of only three years, was certainly unreasonable, imposing unreasonable restrictions on the right of the petitioner to carry on business and was, therefore, liable to be struck down as unconstitutional.	None
The other judgment relied upon by Shri L. Nageshwar Rao was Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Limited and Another Vs. Reserve Bank of India reported in (1992 (2) SCC 343 ).	None
Following observation from paragraph 48 from this judgment is extremely apposite.	None
The observation is as follows 48.	None
Article 19(1)(g) provides fundamental rights to all citizens to carry on any occupation, trade or business.	None
Clause (6) thereof empowers the State to make any law imposing in the interest of the general public, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the said rights.	None
Wherever a statute is challenged as violative of the fundamental rights, its real effect or operation on the fundamental rights is of primary importance.	None
It is the duty of the Court to be watchful to protect the constitutional rights of a citizen as against any encroachment gradually or stealthily thereon.	None
When a law has imposed restrictions on the fundamental rights, what the Court has to examine is the substance of the legislation without being beguiled by the mere appearance of the legislation.	None
The legislature cannot disobey the constitutional mandate by employing an indirect method.	None
The Court must consider not merely the purpose of the law, but also the means how it is sought to be secured or how it is to be administered.	None
The object of the legislation is not conclusive as to the validity of the legislation The Court must lift the veil of the form and appearance to discover the true character and the nature of the legislation and every endeavour should be made to have the efficacy of fundamental right maintained and the legislature is not invested with unbounded power.	None
The Court has, therefore, always to guard against the gradual encroachment and strike down a restriction as soon as it reaches that magnitude of total annihilation of the right.	None
The observations are extremely relevant in the present context.	Reasoning
Now, there could be no dispute that the impugned provision 47(3) is nothing, but an award of gratuity, though it has been given a nomenclature of service compensation.	Reasoning
When we closely examine Section 47(3), it suggests that an employee, who has to be in a continuous service of not less than one year, becomes eligible for service compensation, amounting to fifteen days average wages for each year of continuous employment (i) on voluntary cessation of his work after completion of 60 years of age or (ii) on his resignation or (iii) on physical or mental infirmity duly certified by a Registered Medical Practitioner or (iv) on his death or disablement due to accident or disease.	Reasoning
This is nothing but the provision of a gratuity.	Reasoning
It is already held by this Court time and again that the concept of gratuity as conceived in the Payment of Gratuity Act and even earlier to that in labour jurisprudence is that gratuity is a reward for long and continuous service.	Reasoning
It is for the first time by that Act, a worker or an employee was made entitled to the gratuity by his rendering continuous service for five years.	Reasoning
If this is so, then providing only one year for entitlement to get the gratuity, is certainly unreasonable.	Reasoning
What we have to see is the real nature of the socalled service compensation.	Reasoning
The service compensation is nothing, but a gratuity and the High Court has correctly held it to be a gratuity.	Reasoning
If we are required to lift the veil as per the mandate of this Court in Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Limited and Another Vs. Reserve Bank of India reported in 1992 (2) SCC 343 (cited supra), then it is obvious that the unnatural name of service compensation is given to what in fact, is a gratuity.	Reasoning
We need not dilate on this subject as the High Court has given good reasons to hold it to be a gratuity.	Reasoning
As if this is not sufficient, the proviso to subSection (3) provides that in case of termination of the employment due to death or disablement, even this one years service will not be necessary.	Reasoning
In spite of the presumption of constitutionality of a provision, we do not think that such a provision can be held to be reasonable.	Reasoning
It is undoubtedly an unreasonable inroad on the fundamental right of the respondent (petitioner before the High Court) under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.14.	Reasoning
As if this is not sufficient, we find from the definitions of Commercial Establishment and Establishment under the Shops Act that there are always two sets of employees in an establishment, being administrative or clerical and technical employees.	Reasoning
While the factory owner would be required to pay the gratuity to the employee working in the factory only on his completing five years of continuous service, in case of the employee working on the administrative or clerical side of the factory or in the office, which may be in the same premises where the factory is situated, merely one year of service or even lesser than that, would be sufficient and the factory owners would have to pay the gratuity or the service compensation, as the case may be, to such person.	Reasoning
Thus, the provision is clearly discriminatory and unreasonable.	Reasoning
One look at the definition of Commercial Establishment would convince that the inclusion of an establishment of a factory or an industrial undertaking which falls outside the scope of Factories Act, 1948 and thereby entitling the employees working therein for the payment of service compensation, clearly brings out the discrimination between such employees and the employees working in the factories as covered by Factories Act, 1948.	Reasoning
The definition of Employee is also extremely relevant in this behalf, and when the two provisions, viz., Sections 2(5) and 2(8) are read together along with Sections 2(11) and 2(10), the position becomes crystal clear that the provision of Section 47(3) is clearly discriminatory and, therefore, hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India.	Reasoning
We, therefore, cannot accept the argument of the appellant that the said provision under Section 47(3) is made for a classification and, therefore, there is no discrimination as the classification has a nexus with the object of the Act.	Reasoning
Much debate went on the said object, which was stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons and was also clear from the Preamble.	Reasoning
We, however, do not see as to how such discrimination is permissible in the two sets of employees and what is the rationale for providing a short period of one year as compared to five year period in case of employees covered under the Factories Act, 1948.15.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the High Court was absolutely correct in holding that the provision of Section 47(3) is hit by Article 14 of the Constitution of India.16.	Reasoning
We must, at this juncture, take stock of the argument that it was legally permissible for the legislature to prescribe lesser period for the purpose of grant of service compensation.	Reasoning
Our attention was invited to the oft quoted case of Bakshish Singh Vs.	Reasoning
Darshan Engineering Works Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
(cited supra).	Reasoning
In fact, Shri L. Nageshwar Rao, Learned Senior Counsel for the respondents also relied on the case of Bakshish Singh	Reasoning
Vs.	Reasoning
Darshan Engineering Works Ors.(cited supra) along with two other cases earlier decided, viz.,	Reasoning
M s. British Paints (India) Ltd.	Reasoning
Vs.	Reasoning
Its Workmen reported in (1966 (2) SCR 523 ) and	Reasoning
Straw Board Manufacturing Co. Ltd.	Reasoning
Vs.	Reasoning
Its Workmen reported in (1977 (2) SCC 329 ).	Reasoning
Our attention was invited by the Learned Counsel for the appellant, more particularly, to paragraph 16 and 17 in case of Bakshish Singh Vs.	Reasoning
Darshan Engineering Works Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
(cited supra).	Reasoning
The observations are, in fact, adverse to the case put up by the appellant.	Reasoning
In paragraph 16, this Court observed that the concept of gratuity had undergone metamorphosis over the years.	Reasoning
This Court further recognized that though gratuity meant payment, gift or a boon made by the employer to employee in industrial adjudication, it was considered as a reward for long and meritorious service and the payment of gratuity depended upon duration and the quality of service rendered by the employee.	Reasoning
The Court further observed that at a later stage in the industrial jurisprudence, the gratuity came to be recognized as a retrial benefit in consideration of the service rendered and the employees could raise an industrial dispute for introducing the concept of gratuity as a condition of service.	Reasoning
The Court also went on to observe that such payment of gratuity depended on various factors like financial stability and capacity of the employer, the service conditions prevalent in the industry and the region, availability of the other retrial benefits and the standard of other service conditions.	Reasoning
The Court very specifically observed that the quantum of gratuity was determined by the said factors.	Reasoning
The Court then made observations that the minimum qualifying service for the entitlement to the gratuity or the rate at which it was to be paid and the maximum amount payable was determined on the basis of the aforementioned factors.	Reasoning
In paragraph 17, the Court observed that the industrial adjudicators insisted upon certain minimum years of qualifying service before an employee could claim it whether on superannuation or resignation or voluntary retirement, which was inconsistent with the concept of gratuity being an earning for the services rendered.	Reasoning
The Court then went on to observe that there was no fixed concept of gratuity or of the method of its payment, and like all other service conditions, the gratuity schemes could differ from establishment to establishment depending upon various factors mentioned earlier.	Reasoning
One such prominent factor was the financial capacity of the employer to bear the burden.	Reasoning
The Court was also not unmindful of the distinction between the provident fund and gratuity.	Reasoning
While in former, there was a contribution from the employer, in case of gratuity such contribution was not a necessary ingredient.	None
The Court then observed in paragraph 17 as under 17.	None
Likewise, the gratuity schemes may also provide differing qualifying service for entitlement to gratuity.	None
It is true that in the case of gratuity, an additional factor weighed with the industrial adjudicators and courts, viz., that being entirely a payment made by the employer without there being a corresponding contribution from the employee, the gratuity scheme should not be so liberal as would induce the employees to change employment after employment after putting in the minimum service qualifying them to earn it.	None
(Emphasis supplied)	None
This would suggest that before introducing any such concept of service compensation which was nothing but the gratuity, the aforementioned factors were bound to be taken into consideration and to be provided for.	None
What we see from the impugned provisions is, firstly, the compulsory nature of the service compensation and secondly, the total absence of guidelines.	Reasoning
It is not understood as to how and why in all employments through out, such a short period of one year or even lesser than that has been provided and what is the rationale for the same.	Reasoning
When we see the observations in case of Bakshish Singh Vs.	Reasoning
Darshan Engineering Works Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
(cites supra), it is clear that there has to be some minimum qualifying service.	Reasoning
To reduce the service to one year or even to the lesser period, a qualifying service would, in our opinion, be absurd and was rightly rejected by the High Court.	Reasoning
Therefore, it cannot be said that in all the circumstances, it is permissible for the legislatures to prescribe a lesser period.	Reasoning
We can understand the period being a lesser, but not to the extent of nonexistent period of one year or as the case may be, six months, as provided in Section 47(3), which would not amount to reasonable period for the entitlement to get the gratuity.	Reasoning
Such provision is, therefore, obviously, unreasonable.	Reasoning
The contention of the Learned Counsel for the appellant is, therefore, rejected.17.	Reasoning
At the same time, insofar as Section 47(4) is concerned, the provision is per se unreasonable.	Reasoning
We have already quoted Section 40(3) of the 1966 Act in the earlier part of the judgment.	Reasoning
We, therefore, do not reproduce the Section here.	Reasoning
It is to be remembered that this Section was found to be unconstitutional in the earlier judgment of the Division Bench in case of Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Reasoning
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors.	Reasoning
(cited supra) and the said judgment had become final.	Reasoning
The Section is clearly comparable to Section 47(3) and also Section 47(4), as the last part of that Section is identical with the wording in Section 47(4).	Reasoning
The only difference, which we find is that instead of word gratuity, the terminology of service compensation is substituted.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the High Court was right in opining that a mere cosmetic amendment could not have been made by way of introduction of Sections 47(3) and 47(4).	Reasoning
It was tried to be argued before us that in the present 1988 Act, the mischief pointed out by the High Court in earlier Section 40(3) of the 1966 Act has been remedied.	Reasoning
We are unable to agree with such argument.	Reasoning
We do not see as to how and in what manner, the mischief has been remedied.	Reasoning
In its judgment, the High Court has compared both the provisions and has found that the period of six months, as contemplated in the 1966 Act, was made one year.	Reasoning
The High Court also noted that the provision was declared ultravires on the ground that the workmen working in the factory which would be large in size are eligible to be paid gratuity on rendering long and meritorious service under the scheme of Payment of Gratuity by industrial adjudication, i.e., prior to the enactment of Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, whereas, the employees of a shop or an establishment which is smaller in its operations covered under the 1966 Act, will be entitled to such gratuity on rendering of minimum qualifying period of only six months unbroken service.	Reasoning
The High Court also noted that the provisions of Sections 47(3) and 47(4) were nothing, but a cosmetic amendment to the earlier Section 40(3).	Reasoning
It is, therefore, clear that no attempt has been made, whatsoever, to point out the mischief found by the High Court in Section 40(3) of the 1966 Act.	Reasoning
It was tried to be urged that the Payment of Gratuity Act was not in existence at the time the High Court rendered its decision in Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Reasoning
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors.	Reasoning
(cited supra).	Reasoning
We do not see as to how it is relevant at all.	Reasoning
On the other hand, with the advent of Payment of Gratuity Act, the unreasonableness of the provision of Section 47(3) would be all the more prominent.	Reasoning
We are also not in a position to agree that Section 47(4) is, in any manner, a valid piece of Legislation and is only in the nature of a procedure and does not amount to penalty.	Reasoning
Now, merely because there is a remedy to the employer under Sections 50 and 51 to point out reasons for not being able to have complied with Section 47(3), the Section does not become a valid Section, particularly, when the identical provision was found to be unconstitutional in case of Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Reasoning
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors.	Reasoning
(cited supra), which judgment had become final.	Reasoning
We, therefore, cannot accept that Section 47(4) is a valid piece of Legislation.	Reasoning
This is apart from the fact that this provision is also capable of being abused or misused by an employee, who may bring out a situation to avoid accepting the payment of gratuity, so as to be able to claim later the wages of the interregnum period.	None
It was argued by the Learned Counsel for the appellant that there could not have been a comparison between the provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act and the present provisions, while deciding the constitutionality.	Arguments of Petitioner
For this purpose, the Learned Counsel relied on the law laid down by this Court in State of M.P. Vs. G.C. Mandawar reported in (1955(1) SCR 599).	None
The following observations in that case were relied upon Article 14 does not authorize the striking down of a law of one State on the ground that in contrast with a law of another State on the same subject, its provisions are discriminatory nor does it contemplate a law of the Centre or of the State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two enactments.	None
The sources of authority for the two statutes being different, Article 14 can have no application.	None
It may immediately be clarified that though it is true that both the laws, i.e., the Shops Act and the Payment of Gratuity Act have been passed validly under Entry 24 of List III of the VII Schedule, it is incorrect to say that the High Court has compared the two provisions.	Reasoning
It is one thing to refer to a provision and quite another to compare it with impugned provision.	Reasoning
The High Court has actually gone into the concept of gratuity right from its inception and has come to the conclusion that for earning the gratuity, the employee does not have to contribute anything, as in the case of a provident fund.	Reasoning
Gratuity is more or less a gratuitous payment by the employer in consideration of long and faithful service by the employee.	Reasoning
The concept of gratuity came to be developed firstly in the industrial jurisprudence and was crystallized by the Central Legislation by way of an Act, where a provision of five years of minimum service was made for an employee to be entitled for payment of gratuity.	Reasoning
However, as has been held in Bakshish Singh Vs.	Reasoning
Darshan Engineering Works Ors.	Arguments of Respondent
(cited supra), the length of five years of service could not have been reduced in absurd manner to a minuscule period of one year or even less than that.	Reasoning
The High Court, therefore, found fault that the basic concept of gratuity was being abused by the reduction of the required service to an almost nonexistent level.	Reasoning
It cannot, therefore, be said that the High Court compared the two provisions.	Reasoning
This is apart from the fact that the reduction to a period of six months was already held to be unconstitutional in the judgment of Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Reasoning
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors.	Reasoning
(cited supra), which judgment had attained finality.	Reasoning
The High Court found that instead of remedying the defects pointed out in the judgment of Suryapet Market Cooperative Society Vs.	Reasoning
Munsif Magistrate, Suryapet and Ors.	Reasoning
(cited supra), a cosmetic change was made by raising the period of six months to one year.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, unable to accept the submission of the Learned Counsel for the appellant that the High Court proceeded on to decide the constitutionality on the basis of a comparison.	Reasoning
We do not, therefore, see how the aforementioned judgment in State of M.P. Vs. G.C. Mandawar reported in 1955(1)	Reasoning
SCR 599 (cited supra) can be of any application and help to the present case.	None
A further criticism was leveled by the Learned Counsel for the appellant that the High Court had struck down the provisions only on the grounds of hardship and that was not permissible.	None
Learned Counsel relied on a decision in Prafulla Kumar Das Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vs.	Reasoning
State of Orissa Ors. reported in (2003 (11) SCC 614 ) and our attention was invited to paragraph 45 thereof.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel also relied on another decision in R.N. Goyal Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ashwani Kumar Gupta Ors. reported in (2004 (11) SCC 753 ), particularly on the observations made in paragraph 5, as also the decision in Government of Andhra Pradesh Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
P. Laxmi Devi reported in (2008 (4) SCC 720 ).	Arguments of Petitioner
Insofar as the last decision is concerned, we do not see as to how it helps the appellant, as in that decision, this Court has recognized the presumption of constitutional validity of a statute.	None
There can be no quarrel with that proposition.	Reasoning
Our attention was invited to paragraphs 70, 72, 73 and 78.	Reasoning
We could not find anything in those paragraphs, which supports the contention that a mere hardship cannot be a ground for striking down a provision.	Reasoning
This Court had only shown the presumption of constitutionality and has cautioned against the light treatment being given to the subject.	Reasoning
In our opinion, that is not the case here.	Reasoning
The High Courts judgment proceeds on solid bedrock of lucid reasoning and is not restricted to hardship alone.	None
In R.N. Goyal Vs.	None
Ashwani Kumar Gupta Ors. reported in (2004 (11) SCC 753 ) (cited supra), while repealing the constitutional challenge to the rules, which was observed by this Court that if the Rules framed under Article 309 of the Constitution of India were for general good, but caused hardship to the individual, the same could not be a ground for striking down the Rules.	None
These observations are not apposite to the present controversy.	None
Here the impugned provisions have not been struck down merely because they would cause hardship to any individual or any class.	None
In fact, the provisions have been shown to be totally unreasonable and in total contradiction with the established norms for the concept of gratuity.	None
Not only that, the provisions have been shown to be discriminatory in respect of the two sets of workers, who are similarly, if not identically circumstanced.	None
In case of Prafulla Kumar Das Ors.	None
Vs.	Reasoning
State of Orissa Ors.	None
(cited supra) also, it was specifically observed in paragraph 45 that the Legislature had the requisite jurisdiction to pass appropriate Legislation, which would do justice to its employees.	None
The Court went on to hold that if a balance is sought to be struck down by reason of the impugned Legislation, it would not be permissible for the Court to declare the legislation ultra vires only because it may cause some hardships to the petitioners.	None
These observations were made in relation to the service jurisprudence, where, the constitutional validity of Orissa Administrative Service, Class II (Appointment of Officers Validation) Amendment Act, 1992, was in challenge.	None
By that amendment, relative seniority was awarded to the direct recruits for the year 1973, who were appointed in the year 1975, over and above, the mergerists born in the said Service by virtue of merger of their parent cadre with the Orissa Administrative Service, Class II.	None
The argument was raised that such grant of seniority would amount to a hardship to the petitioners in the matter of seniority.	None
The Constitution Bench of this Court thoroughly examined the provisions of Section 2 of the Amendment Act with reference to the earlier cases decided on the question and came to the conclusion that it was disinclined to temper with the settled practice, particularly, in view of the law laid down in Direct Recruit Class II Engg.	None
Officers Assn.	None
Vs.	Reasoning
State of Maharashtra reported in (1990 (2) SCC 715 ).	None
It was found that the concept of the year of allotment was workable and it was within the powers of the Government to recruit the officers from variety of sources.	None
It was also found that the seniority awarded was on the basis of a legal fiction, which had to be given its full effect.	None
It was in that context that the observations regarding hardship were made.	None
We are afraid, the factsituation in the present case is entirely different and the observations made are not applicable to the present matter.	None
We, therefore, reject the argument raised by the appellant.	Reasoning
This is apart from the fact that the High Court has correctly observed that even if the law cannot be declared ultra vires on the ground of hardship, it can be so declared on the ground of total unreasonableness applying Wednesburys unreasonableness principles.	Reasoning
The Court, specifically, has also found that this reasonableness is apparent from the fact that the employees falling within SubSections (1) and (3), although from different classes, had been treated equally, giving them the same benefit.	Reasoning
For this purpose, the Court also relied on the observations made in Bennet Coleman Co. Ltd.	Reasoning
Vs. Union of India reported in (AIR 1973 SC 106 ).	Reasoning
The High Court also referred to in this behalf, the observations made in Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Limited and Another Vs. Reserve Bank of India (cited supra) and rightly concluded that the impugned provision was totally unreasonable.	None
This takes us to the last contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the appellant, regarding the question of Doctrine of occupied field.	None
The High Court has observed It may be true that having regard to the provisions contained in List III of VII Schedule of the Constitution, the State can also lay down certain conditions of service.	Facts
But, the same would not mean that smaller units will be burdened with a harsher, oppressive and more onerous statutory obligations than their big brothers.	None
The Payment of Gratuity Act covers the field.	None
Both the State Act and the Central Act, in view of subSection (5) of Section 47 deal with the matter relating to gratuity.	None
The High Court then referred to a decision in Ramachandra Mowa Lal Vs.	None
State of U.P. reported in (AIR 1987 SC 1837 ).	None
It also referred to the decision in Gram Panchayat of Village Jamalpur Vs.	None
Malwinder Singh reported in (1985 (3) SCC 661 ) and relying on the observations made in that judgment, came to the conclusion that the State could not take aid from the provisions of Article 254(2) of the Constitution.	None
The Court further observed that mere assent of the President may not be adequate and the provision in question, being directly in conflict with the Central Act, the same cannot be valid.	None
Further, the Court observed Mechanical assent given by the President may be held to be an idle formality, as there does not exist any evidence that the possible conflict had been brought to the notice of the President before his assent was obtained.	None
The High Court then went on to hold that the instant case would stand on the worse footing, as factually, it would not be disputed that the employees had left the services and those who abandoned the service voluntarily, had not been heard of for a few years.	None
It was noted by the High Court that if the provisions of Sections 47(3) 47(4) are held valid, then such persons who had voluntarily abandoned the service, would be taking the advantage of their own wrong, particularly, in relation to Section 47(4).	None
The High Court also further observed that the union could not have taken the cause of the persons, who had abandoned their services.	None
The impugned judgment is a complete answer to the question raised regarding Article 254(2).	None
There can be no doubt that both the Central Act and the impugned State Act operate in the same field in as much as, the service compensation is nothing, but the gratuity, though called by different name.	Reasoning
Under such circumstances, unless it was shown that while obtaining the Presidential assent for the State Act, the conflict between the two Acts was specifically brought to the notice of the President, before obtaining the same, the State could not have used the escape route provided by Article 254(2) of the Constitution.	Reasoning
We fully agree with the High Court when the High Court held that the two Acts occupy the common field and were in conflict with each other.	Reasoning
The contention of the appellant that Article 254(2) would save the impugned provisions is, therefore, rejected.	Reasoning
In the result, we concur with the judgment of the High Court and confirm the same.	Decision
The appeal has no merits and it is dismissed, but without any order as to the costs.	Decision
