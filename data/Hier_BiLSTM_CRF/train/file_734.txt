After hearing the learned counsel for both the parties we come to the following conclusion The National Commission has exceeded its jurisdiction in exercising its revisional power under Section 21(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded by the State Commission in First Appeal No. 741 of 2006 vide its judgment dated 12.10.2006 wherein the finding of fact recorded by the District Forum was affirmed.	Arguments of Respondent
The facts of the instant case clearly reveal that the National Commission has erred in observing that the appellantSociety is a commercial establishment by completely ignoring the Memorandum of Association and byelaws of the appellantSociety.	None
Both the District Forum as well as the State Commission have rightly held that the appellantSociety is a charitable institution and not a commercial entity.	None
The relevant portion of the order passed by the District Forum reads thus ?6. ??	None
It is not in dispute that complainants are running girls hostel in the name of Complainant no.1.	None
Commercial purpose is also explained under the provisions of the Act.	None
So far as activities of the complainants are concerned, they are running girls hostel and receive fees from the students.	None
The complainants are not carrying out commercial activities.	None
Purchase of goods namely tiles are for the purpose of their hostel and it cannot be said that tiles is subject matter of their business.	None
Whenever any person purchases goods for carrying out business for commercial or for livelihood then only question regarding purchase of goods or availing any activities from trader or professional arises.	None
The complainants are not carrying on business of purchase from opponents.	None
Otherwise also hostel premises can be constructed and there is no direct relation between commercial activity.	None
Therefore, the defence of opponents that complainants are carrying on business activities and thereby complainants are not consumer is not acceptable.	None
Hence, we hold that complainants are consumer of opponents and defence of opponents is rejected.?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
The National Commission has erred by applying the decision in M s Kusumam Hotels Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. case (supra) in holding that the appellantSociety is not a consumer in terms of the definition under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as the purchase of tiles and laying in the same in the rooms of the girl?s hostel run by the appellantSociety is clearly not for any commercial purpose.	Reasoning
The decision in M s Kusumam Hotels Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. case (supra) has no application to the present fact situation for the reason that in the said case complainant was a hotel and the tiles purchased by the hotel were for commercial purpose as the hotel business involves the act of profit making, whereas in the instant case the girl?s hostel in question is run by the appellantSociety as one among its various charitable activities for the benefit of adivasi students.	Reasoning
The appellantSociety is supporting adivasi tribal girls to pursue their education by providing hostel facilities.	Reasoning
The expenses for the food and electricity are being paid by the inmates of the hostel.	Reasoning
The appellantSociety is maintaining the hostel free of cost and no charges in the form of rent, repairs and maintenance are collected from the inmates.	Reasoning
Thus, the appellantSociety cannot be considered as any commercial establishment striving for profit.21.	Reasoning
Further, the National Commission while passing the impugned order has ignored certain facts which throws light on callous attitude on the part of the respondents viz., when the defect in the tiles were brought to the notice of the respondents by sending various letters, there was no action on their part.	Reasoning
Later a local agent on behalf of the respondent no.1Company visited the premises of the girl?s hostel and verified that the said tiles were defective and damaged.	Reasoning
However, no proper attention was paid by the respondents towards the issue.	Reasoning
Further, to assess the damage caused to the appellantSociety by the use of the said defective tiles, a registered architect and interior designer, J.M. Vimawala was hired by the appellantSociety, who in his report declared the tiles to be defective and assessed the damage to the appellantSociety to the tune of Rs.4,27,712.37.	Reasoning
Thereafter, the appellantSociety made a demand of the said amount as damages from the respondents vide legal notice dated 12.08.2002.	Reasoning
But the respondents did not pay any heed to the said notice as well.	Reasoning
Because of such irresponsible and indifferent attitude on the part of the respondents, the appellantSociety was compelled to file Consumer Complaint No. 743 of 2002 before the District Forum.22.	Reasoning
The District Forum, after appreciating the pleadings and evidence on record has rightly awarded Rs. 2 lakhs as damages to the appellantSociety towards defective tiles supplied by the respondents along with compensation towards mental harassment and cost of present proceedings with interest 9 p.a.	Reasoning
from the date of complaint till its recovery.	Reasoning
In concurring with the findings of the District Forum, the State Commission, after proper reappreciation of the facts and evidence on record has rightly exercised its jurisdiction by dismissing the appeal of the respondents.	Reasoning
The National Commission should not have interfered with the concurrent findings of fact recorded in the judgment impugned before it particularly having regard to the nature of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.	Reasoning
Section 21 of the aforesaid Act reads thus ?	None
21.	None
Jurisdiction of the National Commission.?	None
Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the National Commission shall have jurisdiction?	None
(a) to entertain?	None
complaints where the value of the goods or services and compensation, if any, claimed exceeds rupees one crore and appeals against the orders of any State Commission and (b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer dispute which is pending before or has been decided by any State Commission where it appears to the National Commission that such State Commission has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.?	None
The National Commission has to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it only if the State Commission or the District Forum has either failed to exercise their jurisdiction or exercised when the same was not vested in them or exceeded their jurisdiction by acting illegally or with material irregularity.	None
In the instant case, the National Commission has certainly exceeded its jurisdiction by setting aside the concurrent finding of fact recorded in the order passed by the State Commission which is based upon valid and cogent reasons.	Reasoning
The National Commission has reversed the order passed by the State Commission by wrongly applying the decision of M s Kusumam Hotels Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. case (supra) to the set of facts in the present case.	Reasoning
In the said case, the complainant was a hotel, it was considered to be a commercial entity and therefore, it was kept out of the purview of the definition of ?consumer?	None
under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.	None
However, the National Commission has failed to appreciate the fact that in the present case, the appellantSociety is not a commercial establishment rather a registered society helping the adivasi students in their education by providing hostel facilities.	Reasoning
The charges, if any, for accommodation in the hostel are for maintaining the hostel and not for making profit.	Reasoning
Thus, the appellantSociety is consumer within the meaning of the term ?consumer?	None
under Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.	None
The National Commission has erroneously accepted the contention urged on behalf of the respondents in the revisional proceedings that supply of tiles to the appellantSociety by respondent no. 1 through its local agent is for commercial purpose.	Reasoning
The said finding is based on the decision in M s Kusumam Hotels Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. case (supra), which case absolutely has no application to the fact situation.24.	Reasoning
Therefore, the concurrent finding of fact recorded by the District and the State Commission has been erroneously interfered with by the National Commission by passing the impugned order, which is liable to be set aside.	Reasoning
For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal of the appellantSociety must succeed.	None
For the reasons stated supra this appeal is allowed, the impugned order of the National Commission is hereby set aside and we restore the order of the District Forum which is affirmed by the State Commission.	Decision
The matter has been under litigation for the last fourteen years, we direct the respondents to pay or deposit the amount so awarded by the District Forum along with interest 9 p.a.	Decision
within six weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of this judgment.	Decision
The costs of Rs.50,000/ of these proceedings are also awarded in favour of the appellantSociety.	Decision
