of the Applicant Company, and hence service could not have been effected upon him.	Facts
Section 2(35) defines ?principal officer?	None
as follows ?	None
2.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, (35) principal officer, used with reference to a local authority or a company or any other public body or any association of persons or anybody of individuals, means (a) the secretary, treasurer, manager or agent of the authority, company, association or body, or (b) any person connected with the management or administration of the local authority, company, association or body upon whom the Assessing Officer has served a notice of his intention of treating him as the principal officer thereof ?	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
The term agent?	None
would certainly include a power of attorney holder.	None
In State of Rajasthan v. Basant Nehata 2005 (12) SCC 77 this Court held that ?	None
A grant of power of attorney is essentially governed by Chapter X of the Contract Act.	None
By reason of a deed of power of attorney, an agent is formally appointed to act for the principal in one transaction or a series of transactions or to manage the affairs of the principal generally conferring necessary authority upon another person.	None
A deed of power of attorney is executed by the principal in favour of the agent.?(emphasis supplied)	None
Mr. Sanjeev Narayan admittedly being the Power of Attorney holder of the Applicant M s. NRA Iron Steel Pvt. Ltd. for the A.Y. 2009 10 was the agent of the Assesse Company, and hence Notice could be served on him as the agent of the Assessee Company in this case.13.	Reasoning
The ground taken by Mr. Sanjeev Narayan that even though Notice was served on 13.12.2018, he assumed that they were ?	Reasoning
some Income Tax Return Documents? lacks credibility.	Reasoning
It is difficult to accept that the envelope containing the dasti Notice from this Court was considered to be ?	Reasoning
some Income Tax Return documents?.	Reasoning
The deponent does not at all disclose as to when the envelope containing the dasti Notice was ever opened.	None
Furthermore, the ground urged that the Chartered Accountant was suffering from an advanced stage of cataract, and hence was constrained from informing his clients is again not worthy of credence.	None
The dasti Notice was admittedly served on him on 13.12.2018 at his office, which was much prior to his surgery which he states took place on 04.01.2019.	Reasoning
Mr. Narayan had sufficient time to inform the Applicant Company of the proceedings, prior to his surgery.	Reasoning
Furthermore, Mr. Narayan appeared before the Income Tax Authorities to represent the Applicant Company and its sister concerns on various dates prior to his surgery i.e. on 14.12.2018, 21.12.2018, 28.12.2018 and 29.12.2018.	Arguments of Respondent
Keeping in view the abovementioned facts and circumstances, this Court is satisfied that the Applicant Company was duly served through their authorized representative, and were provided sufficient opportunities to appear before this Court, and contest the matter.	None
The Applicant Company chose to let the matter proceed ex parte.	Reasoning
The grounds for Recall of the Judgment are devoid of any merit whatsoever.	Reasoning
The Applicant Company having failed to make out any credible or cogent ground for Recall of the judgment dated 05.03.2019, the Application for Recall is dismissed with no order as to costs.	Decision
