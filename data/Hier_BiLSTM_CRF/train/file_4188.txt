We have earlier referred to the fact that the appellant owned two houses in New Delhi, both known as Faridkot House, one at Lytton Road and the other in Diplomatic Enclave, during the accounting year ending April 12, 1960.	Facts
The assessee claimed reduction of the annual letting value in respect of both these houses on the ground that they were used as his residence.	Facts
This claim regarding the houses arises only in the assessment year 196061.	Facts
The Incometax Officer allowed the reduction in the annual letting value only in respect of one house at Lytton Road.	Facts
There is no discussion in the order as to why the claim for the second house at Diplomatic Enclave was rejected.	Facts
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that as deduction has already been given by the Incometax Officer in respect of the Faridkot House in Lytton Road, the assessee is not entitled to a further allowance in respect of the house at Diplomatic Enclave.	Facts
It is the further view of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that under Section 9 (2) of the Act, the assessee is not entitled to a further allowance in respect of the second house and that both the houses occupied for residential purposes have to be treated as one unit.	Facts
On this ground he rejected the claim of the assessee regarding the allowance in respect of the Faridkot House in Diplomatic Enclave.	None
The Appellate Tribunal, when dealing with the appeal relating to the assessment year 196061 dealt with this claim of the assessee a little more elaborately.	Facts
After a reference to the provisions of Section 9 (2) of the Act, the Appellate Tribunal held that there is nothing in the said provision which entitles the assessee to claim benefit in respect of more residential houses than one.	Facts
But the Appellate Tribunal was prepared to accept the position that the second proviso to Section 9 (2) indicates that the property referred to in the first proviso may consist of more than one residential houses, but that by itself does not lead to the conclusion that the benefit under the first proviso can be claimed in respect of more than one property.	Facts
In this view, the Appellate Tribunal also agreed with the rejection, by the two officers, of the claim made by the appellant in respect of the house situated in Diplomatic Enclave.	Facts

Facts
The IncomeTax Appellate Tribunal, accordingly, referred, for the opinion of the High Court the following two questions of law(1) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the amounts of Rs. 15,570, 15,570, 12,446 and 10,310 received by the assessees minor daughter Rajkumari Mahespinder Kaur in the assessment years 195758, 195859, 195960 and 196061 under the terms of the Trust Deed dated the 1st April, 1955 have been rightly included in the hands of the assessee under Section 16 (3) (b) of the Indian IncomeTax Act, 1922?	Facts
(2) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the assessee is entitled to the reduction of the annual letting value of the Faridkot House in Diplomatic Enclave, New Delhi, by Rs. 1,800/ under the first proviso to Section 9 (2) of the IncomeTax Act, 1922 notwithstanding the fact that the annual letting value of the Faridkot House situated at Lytton Road, New Delhi, is already reduced by Rs.	Facts
1,800/.?	Facts
11.	None
The High Court, by its judgment and order under attack, has answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative.	Facts
The answers in respect of both the questions given by the High Court are against the assessee.	Facts
12.	None
Before the High Court, the appellant appears to have urged that Section 16 (1) (c) of the Act is the only provision that could apply in the present case of settlements and that, as such, the amounts received by the minor daughter of the assessee under the trust deed could not be added to the income of the assessee under Section 16 (3) (b) of the Act.	Facts
The High Court rejected this contention of the assessee.	Facts
The assessee further contended before the High Court that Section 16 (3) (b) will apply only if assets had been transferred for the benefit of the wife or minor child and that as the wife or minor child was not entitled to the corpus of the trust property, that provision does not apply, This contention was also rejected by the High Court.	Facts
The further contention of the assessee was that to attract Section 16 (3) (b) the transfer should be one exclusively for the benefit of the wife or minor child and that the said provision will have no application when the benefit that is sought to be conferred, takes in as in the case of the present trust deed other persons like the major children.	Facts
This contention again was rejected by the High Court.	Facts
The last contention on this aspect that was urged appears to have been that, in any event, under Sec. 16 (3) (b) what could be included is only so much of the income of any person or association of persons to whom the property had been transferred for the benefit of the wife or the minor child and not the income received by the minor child.	Facts
This contention again was not accepted by the High Court.	Facts
The High Court ultimately held that the amounts received by the minor daughter of the assessee under the trust deed have been rightly included under Section 16 (3 (b) of the Act in the total assessable income of the appellant in all the four assessment years.	Facts
13.	None
Regarding the deduction claimed during the assessment year 196061 in respect of the house situated at Diplomatic Enclave, the High Court is of the view that the assessee can claim such a benefit by way of allowance under Section 9 (2) only in respect of one house.	Facts
Such allowance having been given by the Revenue in respect of the residential house at Litton Road, New Delhi, it is the view of the High Court that the appellants claim with regard to the house at Diplomatic Enclave has been rightly rejected by the Revenue.	Facts
14.	None
Before we refer to the contentions of the counsel for the assessee and the Revenue, it is necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the Act in respect of the two points arising for consideration, one relating to the amounts received by the minor daughter and the other relating to an allowance in respect of a second residential house.	None
Though the relevant provision in respect of the 1st aspect is only clause (b) of Section 16 (3), it is desirable to quota all the provisions of Section 16 (3) which run as followsS. 16 (3) In computing the total income of any individual for the purpose of assessment, there shall be included (a) so much of the income of a wife or minor child of such individual as arises directly or indirectly (i) from the membership of the wife in a firm of which her husband is a partner (ii) from the admission of the minor to the benefits of partnership in a firm of which such individual is a partners (iii) from assets transferred directly or indirectly to the wife by the husband otherwise than for adequate consideration or in connection with an agreement to live apart or (iv) from assets transferred directly or indirectly to the minor child, not being a married daughter, by such individual otherwise than for adequate consideration and (b) so much of the income of any person or association of persons as arises from assets transferred otherwise than for adequate consideration to the person or association by such individual for the benefit of his wife or a minor child or both.	None
15.	None
The relevant provisions bearing on the claim in respect of the house in Diplomatic Enclave, are the two provisos in Sec. 9 (2).	None
Sec. 9	None
(2) with the relevant two provisos is as follows9 (2) For the purposes of this section, the annual value of any property shall be deemed to be the sum for which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year.	None
Provided that, where the property is in the occupation of the owner for the purposes of his own residence, the annual value thereof shall first be determined in the same manner as if the property had been let to a tenant and the amount so determined shall be reduced by onehalf of it or eighteen hundred rupees, whichever is less, so however that where the sum so reduced exceeds ten per cent, of the total income of the owner the annual value of the property shall be deemed to be ten per cent, of such total income.	None
Provided further that where the property referred to in the preceding proviso consists of one residential house only and it cannot actually be occupied by the owner by reason of the fact that owing to his employment, business, profession or vocation carried on at any other place, he has to reside at that other place in a building not belonging to him and the residential house is not actually let and no other benefit therefrom is derived by the owner, the income of such property under this section shall, if the property was not occupied during the whole of the previous year be taken to be nil and if it was occupied for a part of the previous year be computed proportionately, so however that the income in respect of such property shall in no case be a loss.	None
16.	None
We will first deal with the point covered by question No. 1 regarding the inclusion in the relevant assessment years in the taxable income of the appellant, the amounts received by his minor daughter under the trust deed dated April 1, 1955.	Issue
Though several contentions have been raised before the High Court and the Appellate Tribunal, Mr. K. C. Puri, learned Counsel for the appellant, has raised before us only two contentions, namely, (1) the assets of Rs. 1,80,000 covered by the trust deed not having been transferred to the wife or minor daughter in question, but to the Grindlays Bank, as trustee, S. 16 (3) (b) of the Act has no application and (2) even if section 16 (3) (b) of the Act applies, what is to be included in computing the total income of the assessee is not the income that has been received by the minor daughter under the trust deed, but only so much of the income of any person or association of persons (in this case the trustee) to whom the assets have been transferred for the benefit of the wife or the minor child.	Arguments of Petitioner
The counsel referred to the decisions of this Court in Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay v. Manilal Dhanji, (1962) 44 ITR 876 (AIR 1963 SC 433 ), Commr. of Incometax, Gujarat v. Keshavlal Lallubhai Patel, (1965) 55 ITR 637 (AIR 1965 SC 866 ) and Commr. of Incometax, West Bengal III v. Prem Bhai Parekh, (1970) 77 ITR 27 (AIR 1970 SC 1518 ) and urged that S. 16 (3) of the Act created an artificial income and had to be construed strictly.	Arguments of Petitioner
That is, according to the learned counsel, the wordings of S. 16 (3) (b) have to be construed strictly and literally.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the basis of such a strict and literal construction, the counsel urged that the two propositions urged by him earlier are amply borne out by S. 16 (3) (b).	Arguments of Petitioner
It is no doubt true that the above decisions lay down the proposition that S. 16 (3) of the Act creates an artificial income and it must receive a strict construction.	Arguments of Petitioner
We may also point out that the first decision, referred to above dealt with a case under S. 16 (3) (b) and has specifically laid down the proposition that the said provision creates an artificial liability to tax and must be strictly construed.	None
But in construing S. 16 (3) (b) the Courts cannot ignore the clear and unambiguous expressions contained therein and all those expressions must receive a proper interpretation.	None
17.	None
Taking the first contention of Mr. Puri, according to him the corpus of the property covered by the trust (in this case the Government Securities) should have been transferred for the benefit of the wife or the minor child.	Reasoning
The minor daughter, in this case, was not entitled to the corpus of the trust property, namely, the securities.	Reasoning
We understood Mr. Puri to urge that S. 16 (3) (b) of the Act will apply only to those cases where ultimately the corpus of the trust property is also transferred to the wife or the minor child, as the case may be.	Reasoning
We have no hesitation in rejecting this contention of Mr. Puri.	Reasoning
The provisions of S. 16 (3) (b) are very clear and the only requirement, so far as this aspect is concerned, is that the assets must be transferred to any person or association of persons and that transfer of assets must be for the benefit of the wife or the minor child or both.	Reasoning
In this connection it is pertinent to note the wordings of S. 16 (3) (a) (iii) and Section 16 (3) (a) (iv).	Reasoning
The former provision clearly refers to assets transferred directly or indirectly to the wife by the husband and the latter provision refers to assets transferred directly or indirectly to the minor child not being a married daughter, but in cl.	Reasoning
(b) of S. 16 (3) the transfer of assets is not to the wife or the minor child or both but to any person or association of persons.	Reasoning
Therefore, it is clear that when the legislature intended to provide for a direct transfer of assets either to the wife or to the minor child, it has used the expressions as are found in S. 16 (3) (a) (iii) and S. 16 (3) (a) (iv).	Reasoning
The different phraseology used in cl.	Reasoning
(b) of S. 16 (3) makes it clear that the transfer of assets need not be to the wife or the minor child.	Reasoning
Nor does the said clause require that the corpus of the property, so transferred to any person or association of persons, should ultimately vest in the wife or the minor child.	Reasoning
Mr. Puri quite frankly admitted that there is no decision to support his contention.	Reasoning
On the other hand, we find that there is a decision of the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay v. Mahomed Yusuf Ismail, 194412 ITR 8 (AIR Bom 160) which is against the contention advanced by Mr. Puri.	Reasoning
In that decision one of the questions that arose for consideration was whether the income received by the wife of the assessee under a deed of wakf can be included in the assessment of the husband under S. 16 (3) (b).	Reasoning
The assessee therein had executed a deed of wakf.	Reasoning
Under the terms of the said deed, the assessees wife was to get 21 of the income accruing from the property which was the subject of the wakf deed.	Reasoning
It was contended that as no part of the assets or the corpus had been transferred to the wife, the income received by the latter cannot be included in the taxable income of her husband, the assessee.	Reasoning
A Division Bench of the Bombay High Court rejected this contention and held that as assets had been transferred, under the wakf deed, to the trustees and as the transfer was beneficial to the wife and that as she had got 21 of the income from the properties, Section 16 (3) (b) of the Act was properly applied by the Revenue.	Reasoning
We are in agreement with this decision of the Bombay High Court and as such the first contention of Mr. Puri will have to be rejected.	Reasoning
18.	None
Coming to the second contention, according to Mr. Puri under S. 16 (3) (b) of the Act, only so much of the income of the person or association of persons to whom the property has been transferred for the benefit of the wife or the minor child and not the income received by the minor that can be included in the taxable income of the assessee According to the counsel, what has been done by the Revenue is to include in the assessment of the appellant, the income received by the minor daughter in the relevant accounting years.	Reasoning
That procedure is opposed to S. 16 (3) (b) of the Act.	Reasoning
Here again, the contention of the learned counsel cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
If this contention is accepted, the position will be that the Revenue might have included the whole of the income arising from the assets transferred to the Grindlays Bank and not merely that portion of the income which has been received by the minor daughter.	Reasoning
Such a construction is totally opposed to the clear provisions of the scheme of Section 16 (3) and in particular the clear wording of cl.	Reasoning
(b) of S. 16 (3) of the Act.	Reasoning
19.	None
From a plain reading of S. 16 (3) (b) it is clear that what is to be included, in computing the total income of the assessee, is that part of the income of the trust which is received for the benefit in this case of the minor daughter.	Reasoning
It is the share income which has accrued to or has been received by the minor daughter under the trust deed, in the relevant accounting year, that has to be included in the total income of her father, the assessee.	Reasoning
The expression so much of the income occurring in this clause also makes it clear that the said provision relates to the share income of the minor daughter, in this case, and not that of the Grindlays Bank, the trustee.	Reasoning
20. Section 16, subsection (3) of the Act provides specifically for assets transferred to the wife or the minor child.	Reasoning
The income from assets transferred to the wife is still to be included in the total income of the husband, if the assets have been transferred directly or indirectly to the wife by the husband otherwise than for adequate consideration (vide subsection (3) (a) (iii)).	Reasoning
Again so much of the income of any person or association of persons, as arises from assets transferred otherwise than for adequate consideration, to the person or association, by the husband, for the benefit of his wife has to be included in the husbands taxable income.	Reasoning
(vide subsection (3) (b)).	Reasoning
The same subsection (3) of S. 16 of the Act provides for the income, from the assets transferred by a father to his minor child, to be included in the total income of the father, if the assets have been transferred, directly or indirectly to the minor child, not being a married daughter, otherwise than for adequate consideration (vide subsection (3) (a) (iv)).	Reasoning
Again, so much of the income of any person or association of persons, as arises from assets transferred, otherwise than for adequate consideration, to the person or association by the father, for the benefit of his minor child has to be included in the fathers taxable income.	Reasoning
(vide subsection (3) (b)).	Reasoning
The above is the scheme of S. 16 (3) of the Act.	Reasoning
It must also be noted that under S. 16 (3) (a) subclauses (iii) and (iv) and also clause (b) of subsection (3) the transfer contemplated thereunder should have been otherwise than for adequate consideration.	Reasoning
The words adequate consideration denote consideration other than mere love and affection.	Reasoning
There is no controversy, in the case before us, that the transfer, by the of trust, is one otherwise than for adequate consideration.	Reasoning
It is true that when assets are transferred to the trustees, as in the case before us, there was income in the hands of the trustees and the latter were liable to pay tax thereon.	Reasoning
That, however, is not the question before us.	Reasoning
The question before us is whether the income, representing the share of the minor daughter, which has accrued in the hands of the trustee, or was received by the said minor could be included in the total income of the appellant under cl.	Reasoning
(b) of subs.	Reasoning
(3) of S. 16.	None
21.	None
For a proper appreciation of cl.	Reasoning
(b) of S. 16 (3), in our opinion, that clause must be read in the context of the scheme of S. 16 and the two clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (3) of S. 16, must be read together.	Reasoning
So read, the reasonable interpretation to be placed on cl.	Reasoning
(b) appears to be that the scheme of the section requires that an assessee can only be taxed, on the income, from a trust fund created for the benefit of his wife or minor child or both, provided that in the year of account, the wife or the minor child, or both, have derived some benefit under the trust deed.	Reasoning
That is, the wife or the minor child, either has received the income or the income has accrued to them or they have a beneficial interest, in the income in the relevant year of account.	Reasoning
From this it follows, that if no income accrues or benefit is derived and there is no income at all, so far as the minor child, in the case before us, is concerned, then it is not consistent with the scheme of section 16, that the income or the benefit which is nonexistent, so far as the minor child is concerned, is to be included in the income of his or her father.	Reasoning
In the case before us, there is no controversy that the minor daughter has received the income in all the relevant accounting years.	Reasoning
22.	None
Mr. B. Sen, learned counsel for the Revenue, has drawn our attention to the two decisions of this Court, wherein it has been held that S. 16 (3) (b) of the Act applies, to cases of trust, like the one before us, and that under such circumstances, what is to be included in the total income of the assessee is the share of the income that has accrued to or has been received by the assessees wife or minor child, or both.	Arguments of Respondent
The first decision is Tulsidas Kilachand v. Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay City I, (1961) 42 ITR 1 (AIR 1961 SC 1023 ).	Arguments of Respondent
In this case A, the husband, had created a trust in respect of certain shares owned by him in two companies.	None
Under the said trust, the wife of A was to receive the income.	None
A sum of Rs. 30,404/ was received by the wife, as dividend income, in respect of the shares, regarding which a trust had been created.	None
This amount was added to the taxable income of the husband under S. 16 (3) (b).	None
This Court held that as the transfer of the shares by way of trust, had been effected and as there was a provision for payment of the income accruing from the shares to the wife, and as the latter had received the dividend income, during the relevant accounting year, that amount had been rightly included by the Revenue in the taxable income of the husband.	None
This Court further held that such a case falls squarely within the special rules concerning the wife and the minor child as laid down in S. 16 (3) (b) of the Act.	None
23.	None
The second decision referred to by Mr. Sen is (1962)	Arguments of Respondent
44 ITR 876 (AIR 1963 SC 433 ).	Arguments of Respondent
In that decision the assessee had created a trust in 1953 in respect of a sum of Rs. 25,000/ and the trustees had also been nominated for the purpose of administration of the trust.	None
Under the trust deed, it was provided that the interest accruing on the trust amount of Rs. 25,000/ was to be accumulated and added to the corpus of the trust and that a minor daughter of the assessee was to receive the income from the corpus, increased by addition of interest, every year, on her attaining the age of 18 years.	None
It was further provided that after attaining the age of 18 years, the daughter was to receive the income during her lifetime and after her death the corpus was to go to certain other persons.	None
The daughter, in that case, was to attain the age of 18 years only on February 1, 1959.	None
In the accounting year 1953 54, a sum of Rs. 410/ was received as interest income on the trust fund and it was added by the trustees, in accordance with the provisions of the trust deed, to the corpus.	None
The Incometax authorities, however, included this interest income of Rs. 410/ in the total income of the father, the assessee under S. 16 (3) (b) of the Act.	None
The High Court held that on a true construction of cl.	None
(b) of S. 16 (3) of the Act ,as no benefit has accrued to the minor daughter in the year of account, the sum of Rs. 410/ could not be included in the total income of the assessee.	None
This Court agreed with the view of the High Court.	None
24.	None
It is clear from the above two decisions that when a trust is created, though the income is in the hands of the trustees, the underlying principle of cl.	Reasoning
(b) of S. 16 (3) is that so much of the income as represents the shares of the wife or the minor child, as the case may be, is to be included in computing the total income of the husband or the father.	Reasoning
This is consistent with the scheme of S. 16 and in particular, subsection (3) thereof, which is intended to foil an individuals attempt to avoid or reduce the extent of tax, by transferring his assets to his wife or minor child.	Reasoning
From the above discussion it follows, that the second contention of Mr. Puri cannot also be accepted.	None
25.	None
Now coming to the second question, referred to the High Court, which relates to the reduction claimed by the assessee of the annual letting value of Faridkot House in Diplomatic Enclave, New Delhi, we have already pointed out that the said claim has been rejected by the Revenue, as well as by the High Court.	Issue
It is admitted by the Revenue as well as the assessee, that the claim of the appellant in this regard in respect of the residential house in Lytton Road, New Delhi, has been allowed by the Revenue.	Reasoning
The question regarding the house in Diplomatic Enclave arises only for the assessment year 196041.	Reasoning
The Incometax Officer has not given any reason for rejecting the claim of the assessee.	Reasoning
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner has held that as the appellant has been granted the usual allowance in respect of Faridkot House in Lytton Road, he is not entitled to any further allowance in respect of another house.	Reasoning
In fact the officer has said that both the houses have to be treated as one unit for purposes of computing the annual letting value.	Reasoning
But there is one finding, in the order of the Appellate Assistant commissioner, which is to be noted, namely, that the houses in Lytton Road and Diplomatic Enclave are used and occupied by the assessee for residential purposes.	Reasoning
The Incometax Appellate Tribunal has not differed from the finding of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that both the houses are used and occupied for residential purposes by the assessee.	Reasoning
But the Appellate Tribunal has also taken the view that the assessee is entitled to the necessary allowance only in respect of one residential house, under the first proviso to S. 9 (2) and that the second proviso thereto does not help the assessee.	Reasoning
According to the Appellate Tribunal, the second proviso to S. 9 (2) of the Act will take in cases where the property, in the occupation of an assessee for purposes of residence, consists of more than one residential houses but so situated as to form one property.	Reasoning
The Appellate Tribunal has given an illustration of a palace or a bungalow with various outhouses.	Reasoning
In such a case, according to the Appellate Tribunal, all the buildings situated in one compound are to be treated collectively as one property, for the purpose of the first proviso.	Reasoning
In this view, the Appellate Tribunal also rejected the claim of the assessee in respect of the house in Diplomatic Enclave.	Reasoning
26.	None
The High Court has very summarily rejected the claim of the appellant in this regard.	Reasoning
After referring to the contention of the assessee that the second proviso to S. 9 (2) clearly indicates that the first proviso contemplates an assessee having more than one residential house it has held that the said contention cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
27.	None
Mr. K. C. Puri, learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the finding of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the two houses in Lytton Road and Diplomatic Enclave are used for residential purposes by the assessee, has not been departed from by either the Appellate Tribunal or the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
On this basis, Mr. Puri urged that a reading of the first and second provisos to section 9 (2) of the Act clearly shows that the allowance, to an assessee, is not confined only to one residential house, as held by the Revenue and the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
A reading of the second proviso to subsection (2) clearly, in our opinion, indicates that the first proviso will take in more than one residential house, if the assessee is able to establish that all the houses are occupied by him for purposes of his own residence.	Reasoning
So far as this is concerned, we have already pointed out that the finding is in favour of the assessee.	None
28.	None
Mr. B. Sen, learned counsel for the Revenue, found considerable difficulty in supporting the order of the High Court, answering question No. 2 in the negative and against the appellant.	Arguments of Respondent
But he attempted to argue that the question, whether the assessee is actually occupying the house in Diplomatic Enclave also for purposes of his own residence, has not been investigated.	Arguments of Respondent
We are not inclined to accept this contention of Mr. Sen. We have already referred to the finding of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner to the effect that both the houses  one in Lytton Road and the other in Diplomatic Enclave  are used and occupied by the appellant for purposes of his own residence.	None
This finding has not been disturbed either by the Appellate Tribunal or by the High Court.	Reasoning
If so, on a proper construction of the first proviso to subsection (2) read with its second proviso clearly supports the contention of Mr. Puri that the view of the Revenue and the High Court that the assessee can claim allowance only for one residential house, is erroneous.	Reasoning
29.	None
To conclude, we are in agreement with the view of the High Court when it answered the question No. 1 in the affirmative and against the assessee.	Decision
But we answer the question No. 2 in the affirmative in favour of the assessee.	Decision
Our answer to question No. 2 will be substituted, in the place of that given by the High Court.	Decision
The judgment and order of the High Court are modified to the extent indicated above, and the appeals are allowed in part.	Decision
The parties will bear their own costs.	Decision
30.	None
Appeals partly allowed.	None
