The first question to be considered is as to whether Palm Kernel at the relevant time could be imported under OGL as done by the appellant or it could not be done as the same was canalised item which could have been imported through STC or Hindustan Vegetables Oil Corp., New Delhi (a Government of India Undertaking).	Issue
The contention in this regarded by Mr. Ashok Sen on behalf of the appellant company is that palm seeds and Palm Kernel were two different items as shown in the commercial transitions in the trading community in such goods, as well as interpreted by the Central Plantation Corps Research Institute, Trivendrum by letter dated January 21, 1987 and by a reply of the customs authorities themselves dated February 19, 1987 that Palm Kernel would not be covered under Notification No. 127Cus dated July 1, 1977.	Arguments of Petitioner
M s. Oil Palm India Limited, a Public Sector Corporation also wrote on July 27, 1987 to the appellant that Palm Kernel and Palm seeds were two different items in trade.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also pointed out that the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports had to issue an amendment notification on July 27, 1987 canalising the import if any other material from which oil can be extracted.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has thus been submitted that before July 27, 1987 there was no question of importing Palm Kernal through canalisation and the appellant was perfectly justified and in its right to import the Palm Kernel under the OGL admittedly issued in its favour.	None
It was thus submitted that palm seeds alone was a canalised item and Palm Kernal cannot be considered as Palm seed.	None
According to Mr. Sen palm seeds had the quality of germination while Palm Kernal could not germinate.	None
Oil was extracted from the pulp and Palm Kernal was prepared after putting Palm seeds to a process of manufacturing.	None
A fiscal statute is to be constructed strictly and in favour of a citizen especially when the question of imposing fine and penalties is involved.	None
It was further argued that both the learned that both the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court have rightly taken the view that palm seeds and Palm Kernel were different items and 11, 570.570 MT of Palm Kernel having been shipped by the foreign seller from Nigeria on or before July 27, 1987, the appellant was legally entitled to import the same under the OGL.	Facts
Mr. Sen frankly conceded that so far as the balance of Palm Kernel now to be imported by the appellant even under the original contract dated June 10, 1987, can be made by the State Trading Corporation or Hindustan Vegetables Oil Corp., New Delhi as already made clear vide Notification dated July 27, 1987.	None
Mr. Sen further contended that Section 15 of the Customs Act, 1962 provides for the date for determination of rate of duty and tariff valuation of imported goods.	None
Section 15 reads as under Date for determination of rate of duty and tariff valuation of imported goods.  	None
(1) The rate of duty and tariff valuation, if any, applicable to any imported goods, shall be the rate and valuation in force,  (a) in the case of goods entered for home consumption under Section 46, on the date on which a bill of entry in respect of such goods is presented under that section (b) in the case of goods cleared from a warehouse under Section 68, on the date on which the goods are actually removed from the warehouse (c) in the case of any other goods, on the date of payment of duty Provided that if a bill of entry has been presented before the date of entry inwards of the vessel by which the goods are imported, the bill of entry shall be deemed to have been presented on the date of such entry inwards	None
The provisions of this section shall not apply to baggage and goods imported by post.	None
On the basis of the above provision it is contented that the rate of duty of the imported goods shall be the rate and valuation in force in the case of goods cleared from a warehouse under Section 68, on the date on which the goods are actually removed from the warehouse.	None
It has been submitted that the High Court committed error in holding that the date for actual removal of the goods in the present case shall be considered as October 2/3, 1987 when the goods entered in the territorial waters of India.	None
On the other hand it was contended that once it is held that the customs authorities wrongly confiscated the goods and wrongly imposed the redemption fine and penalty and the appellant with no fault on its part had to keep the goods in a bonded warehouse under the orders of the Division Bench of the High Court dated September 18, 1987, the date of actual removal from the warehouse be treated as January 28, 1988 when the appellant had filed exbonds bills of entries seeking the clearance of the balance quantity of Palm Kernel.	None
While considering the sequence of dates with regard to the levy of duty it was an admitted position that there was an ad valorem duty of 105 per cent up to December 3, 1987.	None
On December 4, 1987 a notification was issued by the Finance Ministry under Section 25(1) of the Customs Act so as to include Palm Kernel within the scope of Notification.	None
No. 127 dated July 1, 1977 as a result of which Palm Kernel became liable for clearance on nil duty.	None
This position remained up to January 28, 1988 and on January 29, 1988 the notification exempting Palm Kernel from customs duty was withdrawn.	None
Therefore, from January 29, 1988 Palm Kernel became liable for payment of 105 per cent ad valorem import duty.	None
It has thus been contended by Mr. Sen that irrespective of the physical removal of the goods from the warehouse, the goods would be deemed to have been actually removed in law on January 28, 1988 when the petitioner had filed exbond bills of entry seeking clearance of the balance goods.	None
As regards the quantity 3335.864 MT of Palm Kernel are concerned, the same were rightly cleared on payment of nil duty on December 15, 1987 an no duty was leviable on that day on Palm Kernel.	None
It was further argued by Mr. Sen that Section 68 of the Act which reads as under will not apply in the present case Clearance of warehoused goods for home consumption.  	None
The importer of any warehoused goods may clear them for home consumption, if  (a) a bill of entry for home consumption in respect of such goods has been presented in the prescribed form (b) the import duty leviable to such goods and all penalties, rent, interest and other charges payable in respect of such goods have been paid and (c) an order for clearance of such goods for home consumption has been made by the proper officer.	None
It has been contended that clause (b) of Section 68 only speaks of the import duty leviable on such goods and all penalties, rent, interest and other charges payable in respect of such goods.	None
It has been submitted that the redemption fine does not come within the meaning of penalties, rent, interest and other charges mentioned in clause (b) of Section 68.	None
The appellant being an importer of the warehoused goods was thus entitled to clear them without any payment of redemption fine or penalty as neither any rent nor interest or any other charges were payable and in this view of the matter, such goods should have been allowed to be taken away by the appellant on January 28, 1988 itself when he had filed the exbond bills of entry.	None
It has been further submitted by Mr. Sen that in the facts and circumstances of this case the term actual removal used in Section 15(1)(b) cannot mean physical removal as the same was made impossible by the wrongful act of the respondents, it should be given a meaning in the juristic sense as deemed removal.	None
Reliance was placed on the following passing in volume 35 para 1154 and volume 41 para 757 of Halsburys Law of England, (4th Edition.)	None
1154.	None
Methods of Delivery Possession of ponderous goods and chattels in large quantities which cannot readily be transferred from hand to hand may be transferred by any transaction which effectually passes the control to the new possessor, for example by handing over the key of a warehouse or of a place chest in which the goods are stored, with the intention of transferring possession but, as has been repeatedly observed, the delivery of a key does not have this effect unless it actually gives full control of the goods in question.	None
Hence, where it operates as delivery it is, strictly speaking, not symbolic but actual delivery of the goods.	None
The mere transfer of a document representing goods does not ordinarily change the possession of the goods, save the possession of goods at sea can be transferred by indorsement and delivery of the bill of lading.	None
Meaning of delivery Delivery means voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another.	None
It includes symbolic delivery and is not restricted to the physical transfer of the goods themselves, but covers also transfer of possession of documents of title to goods.	None
Where the buyer takes possession pursuant to the leave of the seller, whether concurrent or antecedent, that is a voluntary transfer of possession.	None
It was contended that the learned Single Judge had taken a correct view that the crucial date for levy of duty would be January 28, 1988 and the Division Bench of the High Court committed a clear error in holding that the actual date of delivery for the entire lot of goods should be considered as October 2/3, 1987 when the goods actually arrived in the territorial waters of India.	None
In support of the above contention reliance was also placed on Duni Chand Rataria v. Bhuwalka Brothers Ltd. 1955 (1) SCR 1071 1955 AIR(SC) 182.	None
Mr. Sen in support of his contention that Palm Kernel and palm seeds are different and distinguished, placed reliance on the same authorities which were cited before the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
By Public Notice No. 285/27787	Arguments of Petitioner
Appendix 5 Part B Item No. 5	Arguments of Petitioner
Oil Seeds was amended to bring within the canalised list all other materials from which oil is extracted.	Arguments of Petitioner
He argued that it was not merely a clarificatory notification but it was in fact a notification by which the government added the words all other materials from which oil is extracted in order to include Palm Kernel within the canalised list.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Desai, learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Union of India and customs authorities urged that the distinction sought to be made between Palm Kernel and palm seed was artificial.	Arguments of Respondent
The term palm seed include Palm Kernel within the Import Policy of the government.	Arguments of Respondent
It was contented that kernel means the seed of a fruit enclosed within a hard shell as defined in the dictionary.	Arguments of Respondent
The Import Policy applicable to seed would apply to kernal also, and the import of Palm Kernel by the appellant under the OGL was illegal.	Arguments of Respondent
The importation of the Palm Kernel by taking out the outer shell must be considered only as an ingenuous act on the part of the importers to take shelter under the plea that what has been imported was different than seed as it did not have the capacity to germinate.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant had clearly understood the Import Policy and was fully aware of the fact that Palm Kernel was a canalised item and still it imported the same illegally under the OGL.	Arguments of Respondent
He drew our attention to the definition of the word Kernel in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd edn., vol.	None
I, p. 1150) which is as under Kernel (1) A seed especially the seed contained within any fruit The softer part within the hard shell of a nut or stonefruit The body of a seed within its husk.	Arguments of Respondent
He pointed out that Brushel Tariff Nomenclature in Chapter 12 which consists oil seeds and oleaginous fruit miscellaneous grains, seeds and fruits industrial and medicinal plants straw and fodder, at Item No. 12.01 the list of oil seeds and oleaginous fruit are broken as under Groundnuts Copra Palm nuts and kernels Soya beans Linseed Cotton seeds Castor oil seeds	None
Other He contended that palm nuts and kernels under clause (c) have been included in the category of oil seeds.	None
He emphasised that the appellant had led no evidence to show that the Palm Kernel and palm seed are considered as two different commodities in its popular sense in commerce or trade.	None
He further submitted that Section 21 under Chapter 2(1) of the Import and Export Policy Volume I issued by the government, Ministry of Commerce lays down the principles applying to the inter se interpretation of the entries in the various Appendices as well as imports under OGL.	None
Clause (f) of Section 21 reads as under 21.	None
(f) any item in Appendices 2, 3, 5 or 8 with a specific or a generic description, will preclude the eligibility to its import under Open General Licence, except where the policy allows this clearly.	None
Reliance was also placed on Section 24 of the above Policy which provides that actual users may also seek clarification on any itemwise entry applicable to them, from the Regional Licensing Authorities at Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, who will secure technical advice in the matter.	None
M s. Ganesh Dass Bhoj Raj had sought a clarification and the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports by their letter dated June 12, 1987 had clarified that Palm Kernel is a part of the palm seed and therefore the policy applicable to palm seed was applicable to its part as well and as such its import is canalised through the STC.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant M s. Priyanka Overseas Pvt. Ltd. was also aware about the aforesaid reply given to M s. Ganesh Dass Bhoj Raj as it itself relied upon various correspondence between the customs authorities and M s. Ganesh Dass Bhoj Raj.	None
The appellant, Mr. Desai contended had no justification to get the goods shipped between June 26, 1987 and July 25, 1987.	None
In any event, nothing prevented the appellant to seek clarification from the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports and then proceed in the matter, particularly when the appellant was importing goods valued nearly 3 crores of rupees.	None
Seeking clarification from other agencies as to justify distinction between Palm Kernel and palm seed was of no consequence under Section 24 of the Import Policy.	None
The clarification could have been sought from the Regional Licensing Authorities at Bombay, Madras and Calcutta who could have given technical advice in the matter.	None
He thus contended that Palm Kernel was a canalised item and the appellant had no right to import Palm Kernel under the OGL and as such the customs authorities were perfectly justified in confiscating the goods and imposing the penalty as well as redemption fine.	None
As regards the question of levy duty it was contended by the learned Solicitor General that 6746.472 MT of goods were actually removed on June 17, 1988 and on that date the duty was 245 per cent and the petitioners are liable to pay difference in duty on the aforesaid quantity of the goods.	None
He urged that in the matter of taxation there was no question of applying any principles of equity and there was no question of applying the deeming fiction in construing the provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act.	None
Even if the appellant had entered the bill of entry on January 28, 1988, admittedly the goods were not actually removed on that date and the hiatus if any in actual removal, cannot be extended to an artificial date.	None
It was submitted that this Courts decision in Duni Chand Rataria v. Bhuwalka Brothers Ltd. 1955 (1) SCR 1071 1955 AIR(SC) 182 cited by the learned counsel for the appellant supports his contention.	None
He further contended that it was a well settled proposition that in construing the words of one statue, no help can be sought from the interpretation put to such words in another statue, and to support his contention he placed reliance on CST v. Jaswant Singh Charan Singh 1967 (2) SCR 720 1967 AIR(SC) 1454 1967 (19) STC 469 and Bharat Surfactants (Pvt.)	None
Ltd. v. Union of India 1989 (4) SCC 21 .	None
1989	None
(4) SCC(P) 21.	None
Learned Solicitor General in the alternative contended that even if this Court comes to the conclusion that Palm Kernel was not a canalised item and the customs authorities had no justification to confiscate and impose redemption fine and penalty, the appellant is liable to pay the customs duty at the rate of 105 per cent on the entire goods as held by the Division Bench of the High Court.	None
The appellant fully knowing that the rate of duty in October, 1987 when the goods had arrived in India was 105 per cent and even if the deeming provision for removal of the goods is applied for the purpose of Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act, then it should be October 2/3, 1987.	None
We have given our careful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and have thoroughly perused the record.	Reasoning
We have to first consider whether Palm Kernel and palm seed were two different commodities or Palm Kernel was included in Palm seed for the purpose of import.	Reasoning
The difference between palm seed and Palm Kernel has been explained in the letter of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute dated January 21, 1987 (placed on record), it reads as under The difference between Palm Kernel and palm seeds has also been pointed out in the aforesaid letter according to which palm seed is specially extracted from fruits while kernel is a product obtained after sterilisation, digestion at 95 Degree Celsius, pressing, decarpting, shelling etc.	Reasoning
The Palm Kernel will lose its viability due to the above processes and cannot be used for germination.	Reasoning
Under Appendix 5 Part (b) Item 5 of the Import Policy under the heading Oils seeds only Palm oil Palm seeds have been mentioned.	Reasoning
We agree with the view taken by the High Court in this regard that Palm Kernel cannot be included under the item palm seeds and the two commodities were different as understood in commerce or trade.	Reasoning
We do not want to burden this judgment by citing those authorities which have already been considered for deciding this controversy by the High Court.	Reasoning
We do not see any force in the contention of the learned Solicitor General in this regard that the government had only made a clarification vide Notification dated July 27, 1987 by introducing in Appendix 5 Part (b) Item No. 5 all other oils seeds any other material from which oil can be extracted.	Reasoning
It is significant that in the aforesaid notification published in the Gazette of India Extraordinary para (1) Section 121, it was clearly mentioned that the same was issued as an amendment to the earlier Notice No. 1ITC(PN)/8588 dated April 12, 1985.	Reasoning
The notification stated that the following amendment shall be made in the Policy at proper places indicated below and then under the head amendment the new provision which included all other seeds from which oil can be extracted was mentioned.	Reasoning
It is therefore evident that the Government of India itself, realised the difference in the two commodities therefore it amended is previous policy.	Reasoning
We are therefore of the opinion that prior to July 27, 1987 Palm Kernel was not a canalised item and the High Court rightly held that Palm Kernel was not included with in the entry of palm seed.	Reasoning
Since Palm Kernel was not included within palm seed the customs authorities had no legal justification to confiscate or impose redemption fine, or penalty, as the goods had already been shipped on various dates i.e. on June 26, 1987 and July 25, 1987.	Reasoning
It is no longer in dispute that if the Palm Kernel was not a canalised item before July 27, 1987 then it could have been imported under the OGL before that date.	Reasoning
The crucial dates in this regard are June 26, 1987 and July 25, 1987 when the goods were actually loaded in the ship and not the date of arrival of the ship in the territorial waters of India.	Reasoning
The next question which falls for consideration is as to what duty could be imposed in the facts and circumstances of the present case.	Issue
The admitted facts of the case are that 10681.832 MT of Palm Kernel arrived in the territorial waters of India on October 2/3, 1987.	None
As the appellant was apprehending some dispute on the import of the same under OGL from the customs authorities, it filed writ petition in the High Court on July 28, 1987 and obtained an interim order from the learned Single Judge to the effect that the goods shall be released to the party on furnishing bank guarantee for a value equivalent to onefourth value of the goods and on the strength of a bond for the remaining threefourth value of the goods.	None
That order was clarified by another order on August 3, 1987 by which the court directed that the appellant shall pay the entire customs duty as may be determined and demanded by the customs authorities in cash and it shall furnish a bond for the entire value of the goods.	Facts
It was further made clear that the customs authorities shall not release the goods unless the entire customs duty as determined and demanded by them was fully paid in cash by the appellant.	Facts
The Union of India filed an appeal against the aforesaid order before the Division Bench of the High Court.	None
The Division Bench passed an order on September 18, 1987 to the effect that the imported goods should be kept in a bonded warehouse or in any other warehouse approved by the customs authorities and until further orders M s. Priyanka Overseas Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. will not take delivery of the same.	None
In the light of the directions of the court the petitioners filed 16 bills of lading for bonding the entire cargo of Palm Kernel and the goods were allowed to be bonded in terms of the courts order in a private warehouse.	None
Meanwhile proceedings were continuing for adjudication before the customs authorities.	None
The Division Bench of the High Court on December 2, 1987 directed the Collector to adjudicate the matter within 10 days.	None
The Collector by his order dated December 7, 1987 held that the Palm Kernel was a canalised item and as such he gave an order to confiscate the entire quantity of Palm Kernel but gave an option to the appellant to redeem the goods on payment of a fine of Rs. 90 lakhs.	None
The option was to be exercised within one month and the appellant was directed to pay penalty of Rs. 10 lakhs.	Facts
The appellant deposited the amount of Rs. 10 lakhs imposed as penalty and a proportionate amount of Rs. 35 lakhs for redeeming 3935.364 MT of Palm Kernal and removed the goods on December 17, 1987.	None
The petitioners then filed bills of entry for the remaining 6746.468 MT of Palm Kernel on January 28, 1988 but did not deposit the redemption fine.	None
The government issued a notification on January 29, 1988 withdrawing the exemption duty on Palm Kernel and as a result of which the earlier duty on 105 per cent came into effect.	None
The petitioners then deposited the balance amount of Rs. 55 lakhs as redemption fine on January 30, 1988, but the goods could not be released as again controversy arose regarding the amount of duty on the goods.	None
The government increased the duty from 105 per cent to 245 per cent in its Budget which came to be applied on March 1, 1988.	Facts
The petitioner then approached this Court by filing a SLP.	None
The Court on June 2, 1988 passed the following order  Issue notice Issue notice on the stay application Meanwhile the operation of the order of the Division Bench of the High Court directing payment of duty in respect of the goods to the extent of 3935.364 MT which had already been released to the petitioner is stayed.	None
The respondents are further directed to release the remaining goods to the petitioner in respect of which bills of entry were filed on January 28, 1988 on payment of such duty as was leviable on January 28, 1988.	None
The respondents shall refund a sum of Rs. 50 lakhs to the petitioners out of the sum of Rs. 1 crore which has been directed by the High Court to be refunded within two weeks and the remaining amount of Rs. 50 lakhs shall be retained by the respondents towards the duty payable on goods, which are to be released to the petitioners within two weeks.	None
Section 15 of the Act provides for determination of rate of duty on imported goods.	None
The rate of duty and tariff valuation, if any, applicable to any imported goods, shall be the rate and valuation in force in the case of goods cleared from a warehouse under Section 88, the date on which the goods are actually removed from the warehouse.	None
There can be no manner of doubt that the term actual removal is even more stronger than the term physical removal and the intention of the legislature in using these words clearly stipulates the actual removal of the goods from the warehouse.	None
The rate of duty and tariff valuation on the imported goods may be changed from time to time and as such the legislature has clearly expressed its intention under Section 15 as to on what date the rate of duty and tariff valuation is to be determined.	None
We cannot introduce the concept of deeming provision while determining the question of actual removal of the goods from the warehouse.	None
The rate has to be determined on the basis of the date on which the goods are actually removed from the warehouse and thereafter the question would be examined as to how the relief is to be moulded in case it is found that the customs authorities were themselves responsible in preventing the importer of goods actually removing the goods from the warehouse.	None
In a case of the present kind where there is no ambiguity in the expressed intention of the legislature in determining the date for applying the rate of duty, no juristic principle of deemed removal of the goods, can be applied as contended by Mr. Sen. Many contingencies may happen in between the filing of bill of entry and actual removal of the goods from the warehouse for which sometimes the importer of goods may himself be responsible, in some cases the responsibility may lie on the customs authorities and there may also be contingencies beyond the control of both the parties.	None
In any case the intention of the legislature being clear, rate of duty is to be applied, as may be in force on the date of actual removal of goods from the warehouse under Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act.	None
Learned counsel for both the parties have placed reliance on Duni Chand Ratariss case 1955 (1) SCR 1071 1955 AIR(SC) 182 on the question of actual removal of goods.	None
In that case the question arose regarding the expression actual delivery of possession in Section 2(1)(b)(i) of the West Bengal Jute Goods Future Ordinance, 1949.	None
It was held that the expression meant actual delivery as contrasted with mere dealings in itself within the intendment of the Ordinance and such actual delivery of possession included within its scope symbolical as well as constructive delivery of possession.	None
The above case in our view lends no assistance to either of the parties in determining the controversy raised before us in the present case.	None
In Duni Chand Rataria case 1955 (1) SCR 1071 1955 AIR(SC) 182, the appellant Duni Chand entered into three contracts with the respondent agreeing to purchase jute bags on the terms and conditions contained in the relative contract forms of the Indian Jute Mills Association.	None
The respondent expressed its inability to deliver the goods under the said contracts and requested the appellant to settle the same by selling back the goods.	None
Three settlement contracts were accordingly entered into between the parties whereby the appellant agreed to sell the goods under the original contracts to the respondent.	None
The appellant therein then submitted to the respondent his bills for the amounts due at the foot of the said contracts aggregating to Rs. 1, 15, 650 which the respondent accepted out neglected to pay.	None
The appellant therefore filed suit for the recovery of the said sum with interest and costs.	None
The defendantrespondent contested the appellates claim on the main ground that the three settlement contracts were illegal and prohibited by the West Bengal Jute Goods Future Ordinance, 1949.	None
The respondent contended that it never dealt in sale and purchase of jute goods involving actual delivery and possession thereof, nor did it possess or have control over any godown and other means and equipments necessary for the storage and supply of jute goods and therefore said settlement contracts were void and not biding on it.	None
The trial court decreed the suit.	None
The learned Judges of the appeal court however held that the settlement contracts were contracts relating to the purchase of jute goods made on a forward basis by the respondent not being a person who habitually dealt with in the sale and purchase of jute goods involving the actual delivery and possession thereof and were therefore void and unenforceable.	None
In view of these findings the appeal court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit.	None
The plaintiff Duni Chand then filed an appeal before this Court.	None
This Court observed that the point at issue was whether the respondent was a person who habitually dealt in the sale or purchase of jute goods involving the actual delivery and possession thereof and the contention which was vehemently urged on behalf of the respondents in the Courts below was that the transactions were purely speculative, that mere delivery orders did not represent the goods and the transfer thereof did not involve as between the intermediate parties actual delivery or possession of the goods but differences in rates were only paid or received by the parties.	None
While dealing with the above question, it was held as under (SCR pp.	None
108081)The learned Judges of the appeal court also laid unwarranted emphasis on the words actual delivery or possession and contrasted actual delivery with symbolical or constructive delivery and held only actual delivery or possession meaning thereby physical or manual delivery was within the intendment of the Ordinance.	None
Delivery has been defined in Section 2(2) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act as meaning voluntary transfer of possession from one person to another and it nothing more was said delivery would not only include actual delivery but also symbolic or constructive delivery within the meaning of the term.	None
The use of the word actual in Section 2(1)(b)(i) of the Ordinance was considered by the appeal court as indicative of the intention of the government to include within the scope of the exemption only cases of actual delivery of possession as contrasted with symbolical or constructive delivery.	None
This construction in our opinion is too narrow.	None
Even if regard be had to the mischief which was sought to be averted by the promulgation of the Ordinance, the government intended to prevent persons who dealt in differences only and never intended to take delivery under any circumstances, from entering into the market.	None
Provided a person habitually dealt in the sale or purchase of jute goods involving delivery of the goods, he was not to be included in the ban.	None
This could be the only intendment of the Ordinance, because otherwise having regard to the ordinary course of business, business in jute goods would become absolutely impossible.	None
The manufacturer of jute goods does not come normally into direct contact with the shipper.	None
It is only through a chain of contracting parties that the shipper obtains the goods from the manufacturer and if only actual delivery of possession as contrasted with symbolical or constructive delivery were contemplated it would be impossible to carry on the business.	None
If the narrow construction which was put by the appeal court on the expression actual delivery of possession was accepted it would involve each one of the intermediate parties actually taking physical or manual delivery of the goods from their sellers and again in their turn giving physical or manual delivery of the goods which they had thus obtained to their immediate buyers.	None
Such an eventuality could never have been contemplated by the government and the only reasonable interpretation of the expression actual delivery of possession can be the actual delivery as contrasted with mere dealings in differences was within the intendment of the Ordinance and such actual delivery of possession included within its scope symbolical as well as constructive delivery of possession.	None
Thus the above case dealt with the meaning of actual delivery of possession in the background and context of its meaning as laid down in the West Bengal Jute Goods Future Ordinance, 1949 and it can render no assistance in determining the question of actual removal of goods as mentioned in Section 15(1)(b) of the Customs Act.	None
Bharat Surfactants (Pvt.)	None
Ltd. v. Union of India case 1989 (4) SCC 21 relied by the learned Solicitor General was a case of Section 15(1)(a) of the Customs Act.	None
Under the above provision the criteria for determining the rate of duty and tariff valuation is the rate in force in the case of goods entered for home consumption under Section 46, on the date on which a bill of entry is respect of such goods is presented.	None
The section provides that if a bill of entry has been presented before the date of entry inwards of the vessel by which the goods are imported, the bill of entry shall be deemed to have been presented on the date of such date entry inwards.	None
While interpreting the words date of entry inwards of the vessel it was held that it would be the date of entry recorded in customs register.	None
Where vessel arrived and bill of entry was presented at a prior date to the date of berth given by Port authorities and entry inwards registered by the customs authorities at a later date then it was held that the rate of import duty and tariff valuation would be that in force on the later date.	None
This decision is also of no assistance in interpreting the provisions of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act.	None
Section 15(1)(b) provides that the rate of duty would be the rate, as applicable on the date of actual removal of the goods from the warehouse.	None
There can be no manner of doubt that the actual removal of goods of 3935.364 MT was December 17, 1987 and for 6746.468 MT of goods was June 17, 1988.	None
Admittedly the quantity of 3935.364 MT of Palm Kernel were allowed to be cleared by the customs authorities itself on payment of nil duty and rightly so as there was no duty on Palm Kernel on that date.	None
So far as the balance quantity of 6746.468 MT of Palm Kernel is concerned, the contention of Mr. Sen, learned counsel for the petitioners is that the customs authorities had wrongfully detained the goods and had not permitted the appellant to remove the same by imposing a redemption fine and penalty in an illegal manner and the appellant had to approach the Court for quashing the same and it was only thereafter that it filed the bill of entry on January 28, 1988 and thereby it became entitled to remove the goods on that very day and there being no duty on that day, the customs authorities were not entitled to charge any duty.	None
The question is whether the appellant is liable to pay duty on the balance quantity of 6746.468 MT of Palm Kernel and if so, what should be the rate of duty.	Issue
In determining this question it must be borne in mind the statutory principle that if a party discharges its liability by complying with the requirement of law, and presents papers for clearance of goods, it is obligatory on the revenue authorities to pass the order immediately thereon.	None
If the revenue authorities either refuse to pass the order on some erroneous or imaginary grounds or on account of any misconception of law, the department cannot take advantage of its own wrong in demanding higher rate of duty from the importer.	None
Under Section 68 and 71 of the Act, goods placed in a warehouse can be taken out only after clearance for home consumption.	None
Admittedly, the appellant had done its part of legal duty by presenting bills of entry and complying with Section 68(a) of the Act on January 28, 1988.	None
But the Customs Officers refused to release the goods on an erroneous assumption that the appellant was liable to pay redemption fine and since it had not paid the said amount, the goods were not liable to be released.	None
The High Court held that the imposition of redemption fine was nonest and the petitioner was within its right to claim release of goods without paying any redemption fine, on the day it complied with the formalities under Section 68 for the Act.	None
Section 68(c) of the Act prescribes an official function which was not performed by the customs authorities due to entertainment of a wrong and illegal notion regarding the payment of redemption fine which resulted into a wrong order by the department.	None
In the circumstances the department cannot be allowed to take advantage of its own wrongful and illegal act.	None
In moulding relief, this Court has always applied principles of equity in order to do complete justice between the parties.	None
The High Court has overlooked that on October 15, 1987 the petitioner had only applied for warehousing of the goods on the direction of Division Bench of High Court.	Reasoning
The Single Judge had passed an interim order for clearing the goods after payment of customs duty, but the department went in appeal and the Division Bench by its order dated September 18, 1987 directed the imported goods to be kept in a bonded warehouse or any other warehouse approved by the customs authorities and until further orders the appellant was directed not to take delivery of the same.	Reasoning
The appellant submitted the bills of entry on January 28, 1988 and admittedly no duty was payable on that date.	Reasoning
Moreover where goods imported are kept in a warehouse under a bond, the date of arrival of such goods in India is not relevant for determining the duty therefore the High Court committed error in holding the appellant was liable to pay duty as in force on the date of arrival of goods.	Reasoning
On the question of actual removal of goods for the purposes of determining the rate of duty payable by the importer under Section 15(1)(b) of the Act it is necessary to bear in mind that the Act provides for two classes of warehouses, under Chapter IX of the Act.	None
Section 58 provides for licensing of private warehouses.	None
Section 59 requires an importer to execute a warehousing bond.	None
Section 68 provides for clearance of warehoused goods for home consumption.	None
Section 73 provides for cancellation and return of warehousing bond.	None
Whenever the customs authorities permit the storage of imported goods in a private warehouse, these provisions would be applicable.	None
The appellant filed bills of entry for home consumption as required by Section 68 of the Act with a prayer for debonding the goods of 3935.364 MT on December 17, 1987 which were stored in a private warehouse.	None
The customs authorities on that very day namely December 17, 1987 cancelled the licence for warehousing the quantity of goods in respect of which the bills of entry were filed by cancelling the bond and deleting the said godown from the relevant licence issued for the quantity of 11, 500 MT.	None
Endorsement to that effect was made on the licence of warehouse and the keys of the godown were also handed over to the appellant simultaneously, as a result of which though the goods remained in the said godown but not as a warehouse, instead it was treated to be a private godown of the appellant, and it was allowed to remove the goods without payment of any duty.	None
There is no dispute that the remaining goods were also stored in a private warehouse and the appellant had filed the bills of entry and complied with all the required formalities for debonding and clearance of the goods on January 28, 1988, therefore the appellant was entitled to an order cancelling the licence of the private warehouse enabling it to remove the goods.	Reasoning
Had the customs authorities passed order in accordance with the law the same result would have followed as had been done on December 17, 1987.	Reasoning
The Central Manual published by the Director of Publications, Customs and Central Excise contains directions for determining the actual date of removal of goods from warehouse in terms of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act.	Reasoning
The functioning of private warehousing has been elaborated therein.	Reasoning
Clause 10 of the Manual prescribes the type of buildings which can be approved as private warehouses under Section 58 of the Act.	Reasoning
Para 15 of the Manual provides for purposes of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act, that if the goods are in private warehouse the date of cancellation of the licence of the private warehouse should be taken as the actual removal of the goods for the purposes of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act.	Reasoning
Para 15 as already stated was followed in the appellants own case on December 17, 1987 in releasing the goods.	Reasoning
There is no valid reason as to why the same procedure should not have been followed in respect of the remaining goods in respect of which the bills of entry were filed on January 28, 1988 for debonding and clearance of goods.	Reasoning
Merely because the officer failed to discharge his duties by making illegal demand for deposit of redemption fine, the appellant could not be held liable to pay duty.	Reasoning
The appellant is therefore entitled to the delivery of goods without paying any duty as on January 28, 1988 on duty was payable on the goods.	Reasoning
In the result the appeal filed by the Union of India is dismissed and the appeal filed by	Decision
M s. Priyanka Overseas Pvt. Ltd. and Another is allowed in the manner indicated above.	Decision
The respondents are therefore directed to refund the amount of Rs. 50 lakhs lying in deposit towards redemption fine and personal penalty within one month from today.	Decision
It is made clear the appellant is not entitled to any interest on the aforesaid amount, but if the amount is not returned within one month as directed, the respondents will be liable to pay interest 15 per cent per annum from today till, the date of payment to the appellant.	Decision
In the facts and circumstances the parties shall bear their own costs throughout.	None
