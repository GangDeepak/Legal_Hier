In the said circumstances, according to the learned counsel, the High Court had rightly considered the judgment delivered by this Court in the case of Sarla Verma v. Delhi Road Transport Corporation 2009(6)	Arguments of Respondent
SCC 121 while awarding just amount of compensation.	Arguments of Respondent
He had supported the judgment delivered by the High Court and had submitted that the present appeal be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
Upon hearing the learned counsel and looking at the impugned judgment and the order of the Tribunal as well as the evidence adduced on behalf of the claimants, we are of the view that the Tribunal was not at all lenient in the matter of awarding the compensation and the compensation awarded by the Tribunal was just and proper.	None
We have considered the facts and the injuries suffered by Rajanala Ravi Krishna, who was hardly 17 years old student at the time of the accident.	None
We need not go into the negligence part of the driver because even in the criminal proceedings it had been held that the driver of the vehicle was guilty of rash and negligent driving.	None
Upon perusal of the evidence, we find that the condition of Rajanala Ravi Krishna, after the accident has become very pathetic.	None
Evidence adduced by the Neurologist and other evidence also reveal that Rajanala Ravi Krishna shall not be in a position to speak for his life and shall not be in a position to do anything except breathing for his life, unless a miracle happens.	None
He would require care of a person every day so as to see that he is given food, bath etc.	None
and so as to enable him even in the matter of answering natural call.	None
It would be worth producing the reaction of the Tribunal after appreciating evidence of the doctor and the said portion of the Tribunals order has been even reproduced by the High Court in its judgment It is not in dispute that because of this accident the injured petitioner who appears to be an active and bright student from Exs.	None
A.481 to A.487, he lost all the function of his all four limbs on account of the severe injuries sustained by him.	None
I have myself questioned PW.2 to find out the graveness of the injuries that are sustained by the injured third petitioner.	None
It has been the evidence of PW.2 that there is no possibility of the injured petitioner regaining normal power of all the four limbs inspite of any amount of treatment.	None
The patient require physio therapy throughout his life and assistance of some person for all his activities.	None
PW.2 has also stated that it is difficult to say even by the time he was giving evidence whether the patient could regain his voice, PW.2 further stated that the patient requires regular medication of at least Rs.500/ per day for his subsistence.	None
PW.2 also stated the patient requires some bodies assistance even for taking food and finally PW.2 stated that the patient is medically described as in a vegitiative state and patient is called as spastic quadric paresys.	None
Looking at the aforestated facts which even the High Court had noticed, we feel that the Tribunal can not be said to have awarded more amount by way of compensation.	None
From the order of the tribunal, we find that the appellants had in fact proved that they had spent Rs.3,49,128/ towards medical expenses for treating their son.	Reasoning
They had to purchase certain instruments worth Rs.58,642/ for making life of their son comfortable and Rs.31,000/ had been spent towards nursing and Rs.1,37,000/ had to be spent for Physiotherapist.	Reasoning
Looking at the fact that Rajanala Ravi Krishna will have to remain dependant for his whole life on someone and looking at the observations made by the Tribunal, which have been reproduced hereinabove, in our opinion, his life is very miserable and there would be substantial financial burden on the appellants for the entire life of their injured son.	Reasoning
At times it is not possible to award compensation strictly in accordance with the law laid down as in a particular case it may not be just also.	Reasoning
We are hesitant to say that it is a reality of life that at times life of an injured or sick person becomes more miserable for the person and for the family members than the death.	Reasoning
Here is one such case where the appellants, even during their retired life will have to take care of their son like a child especially when they would have expected the son to take their care.	Reasoning
Though, the High Court has rightly followed the principle laid down in the case of Sarla Verma (supra), in our opinion, the amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal is more just.	Reasoning
The Tribunal awarded a lump sum of Rs.10 lacs and the amount of expenditure incurred by the appellants for treating their son.	Reasoning
The total amount awarded by the Tribunal was Rs.18,75,800/ which, in our opinion, is not too much and in our opinion, the said amount should be awarded to the appellants.	Reasoning
In the circumstances, we quash and set aside the judgment delivered by the High Court and restore the order of the Tribunal.	Decision
The amount of compensation determined by the Tribunal along with interest 7.5 from the date of presentation of the claim petition till its realization shall be paid to the appellants.	Decision
The appeal is allowed with no order as to costs.	Decision
