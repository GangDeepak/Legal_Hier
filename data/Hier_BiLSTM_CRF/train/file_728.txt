It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the chain of circumstances is not complete so as to fasten the guilt upon her.	Arguments of Petitioner
The confession made by the appellant to P.W.4 is not worthy of acceptance and made to police is inadmissible in evidence.	Arguments of Petitioner
There was no reason for the appellant to make a confession to Susheela, P.W.4 as she was not having good relations with her.	Arguments of Petitioner
The recovery of the body is not at the instance of the appellant and the recovery of the motor bike and nylon saree is of no value.	Arguments of Petitioner
The prosecution has failed to examine the material witnesses.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that the appellant has in statement under section 313 Cr.	Arguments of Petitioner
P.C. mentioned that she had gone to the police station along with photograph of the deceased on 23.5.2005 when there was beat of drum in the village by which she came to know that a body was found below the bridge of the canal.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that the appellant is innocent and deserves to be acquitted.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu that the accused and the deceased used to quarrel frequently.	Arguments of Respondent
It was the habit of the deceased of drinking alcohol and indulge in gambling.	Arguments of Respondent
Once the accused persons came to know of the deceased having entered into agreement of sale, they had decided to get rid of him and thereby murdered him and threw the body below the bridge of the canal.	Arguments of Respondent
The deceased was last seen in the company of the accused.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that the extrajudicial confession made by the appellant to P.W.4 and recovery of motor bike and nylon saree which was used for committing murder show that the chain of circumstances is complete.	Arguments of Respondent

It was therefore submitted that the conviction recorded by the trial Court and affirmed by the High Court calls for no interference in the appeal.	Arguments of Respondent
The case depends upon the circumstantial evidence and the extrajudicial confession made by the appellant to Susheela, P.W.4, sister of the deceased.	Issue
This is trite law that the chain of circumstances should be complete to fasten the guilt on the accused.	Issue
Firstly, we will examine whether the extrajudicial confession which is a weak kind of evidence, inspire the confidence.	None
Susheela, P.W.4 has stated that Murugesan was married to the appellant 14 years before the incident.	None
She came in search of his brother Murugesan to the house of the deceased.	None
Murugesan has told her on 12.5.2005 that appellant had threatened to kill him as he was habitual of consuming alcohol.	None
When she did not receive any telephone call for 15 days from the deceased, she went to his village.	None
On enquiry she was informed by the appellant that she, her nephew Prakasam and father murdered the deceased and threw his body under the bridge.	None
Susheela, P.W.4 further stated that the appellant touched her legs and stated that she would give properties of her father to two children and that she should not inform the police.	None
Thereafter, P.W.4 went to the police station on the same day and lodged the complaint Ex.P2.	None
The police showed her the photograph, shirt and slippers and asked her to identify the same.	None
She identified them to be of her brother.	None
She has further stated to have gone to police station after 5 days with photograph of deceased.	None
In the crossexamination, she has also stated that she had signed the agreement for sale of land executed by the accused.	None
It is apparent that accused was not having good relationship with Susheela, PW.4.	None
Making confession to such an inimical person is most unlikely.	None
When the witness had gone in search of the deceased to the house of the accused it is most unlikely that the confessional statement would be made to her readily.	None
It is not that the appellant had gone to the house of P.W.4 to make the confession.	None
On the other hand query was made by the daughter of the deceased to Susheela, P.W.4 as to the whereabouts of the deceased, meaning thereby the whereabouts of the deceased were not known even to his daughter.	None
In case the deceased had been killed in the house, perhaps the daughter would have known about the offence having been committed by the accused.	None
In Sahadevan and Anr.	None
v. State of Tamil Nadu (2012) 6 SCC 403 , it has been observed that extrajudicial confession is weak piece of evidence.	None
Before acting upon it the Court must ensure that the same inspires confidence and it is corroborated by other prosecution evidence.	None
In Balwinder Singh v. State of Punjab 1995 Supp (4) SCC 259, it has been observed that extrajudicial confession requires great deal of care and caution before acceptance.	None
There should be no suspicious circumstances surrounding it.	None
In Pakkirisamy v. State of Tamil Nadu (1997) 8 SCC 158 it has been observed that there has to be independent corroboration for placing any reliance upon extrajudicial confession.	None
In Kavita v. State of Tamil Nadu (1998) 6 SCC 108 it has been observed that reliability of the same depends upon the veracity of the witnesses to whom it is made.	None
Similar view has been expressed in State of Rajasthan v. Raja Ram (2003) 8 SCC 180 , in which this Court has further observed that witness must be unbiased and not even remotely inimical to the accused.	None
In Aloke nath Dutta v. State of West Bengal (2007) 12 SCC 230 it has been observed that the main features of confession are required to be verified.	None
In Sansar Chand v. State of Rajasthan (2010) 10 SCC 604 it has been observed that extrajudicial confession should be corroborated by some other material on record.	None
In Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod v. State of Gujarat (2009) 5 SCC 740 it has been observed that in the case of retracted confession it is unsafe for the Court to rely on it.	None
In Vijay Shankar v. State of Haryana (2015) 12 SCC 644 this Court has followed the decision in Sahadevan (supra).	None
In the circumstances of the case, the confession made to Susheela, PW.4 does not inspire evidence.	None
She was not having good relationship with accused and is not corroborated by other evidence on record, hence, it would not be safe to act upon it in the facts and circumstances of the case.	None
The extrajudicial confession made to police is admissible only with respect to the recoveries made of the moped as well as a piece of nylon saree, pursuant to the information, which articles are not proved to be connected with offence.	None
Firstly, we deal with the recovery of the Bajaj moped at the instance of the appellant.	None
It is deposed by Soundarrajan, P.W.12 that he was running a cooking gas agency and the absconding accused Prakasam was using Bajaj M80 motor cycle to deliver gas cylinders.	None
The appellant accused was first brought by the police to his residence and later on to shop, and the vehicle was recovered by the police from his shop along with certificate of the registration.	None
Prakasan had taken one week leave from him and thereafter did not turn up.	None
Though the prosecution has alleged that Bajaj M80 vehicle was used to carry the body of the deceased by Prakasam and the appellant and they were seen by two witnesses while going towards canal.	None
But the said witnesses had not been examined in the court by the prosecution for the reasons known to it.	None
Thus the prosecution has failed to establish that the vehicle in question was used for carrying the body of the deceased and it was so carried as alleged.	None
The vehicle has been recovered from its owner with no blood stains.	None
It was not in possession of the appellant and was recovered from the gas agency where it was supposed to be.	None
Merely by the fact that the vehicle was used by Prakasan for distribution of the cooking gas cannot be a circumstance so as to fasten the guilt upon the appellant.	None
It was a well known fact that vehicle was used by Prakasam for distribution of cooking gas.	None
Use of the vehicle in the offence in question has not been proved and its recovery which is not from the possession of the appellant, the same cannot be used as a circumstance to fasten the guilt upon the appellant.	None
Now coming to the question of recovery of piece of nylon saree.	None
The statement of Dr. Sivakumar, P.W.20 autopsy surgeon indicates that the body of the deceased was decomposed.	None
As per chemical test report poison was not found.	None
There was no wound caused to larynx before death.	None
As the body of the deceased was highly decomposed the cause of death was not mentioned by the Doctor, P.W.20 in the postmortem report.	None
On query being made to him by the Inspector of Police regarding cause of death, he answered that that since the body was decomposed he was unable to say so, thus, the cause of death has not been established.	None
No internal and external injury has been mentioned in the autopsy report.	None
Thus, the prosecution has not been able to establish that the death was caused by strangulating the deceased and the piece of nylon saree was used to cause the death.	None
Hence, recovery of the piece of nylon saree is of no value as the prosecution has not been able to link the same with the commission of the offence.	None
The appellant had not kept quiet for 15 days from 16.5.2005 to 31.5.2005.	None
She had clearly stated in the statement under Section 313 that she had gone to the police station on 23.5.2005 along with photograph of the deceased and had also stated that the deceased frequently used to go outside for 2 to 5 days.	None
This explains her conduct, nothing more can be attributed to her exclusive knowledge which she was required to explain within the purview of Section 106 of the Evidence Act.	None
Knowledge of any other fact is not attributable to her in view of the evidence adduced in the case.	None
Thus, the submission based upon the provisions contained in Section 106 is of no avail to the respondent.	None
The prosecution has also not led evidence that the appellant was ever required to identify the articles of the deceased.	None
There is nothing on record indicating that they were shown to her for the purpose of identification and she had refused to identify them.	None
There is contradiction in the version of Susheela P.W.4 as to when she identified the deceased.	None
On one hand, she had stated that she did so on 31.5.2005, on the other hand, she has stated that she went to the police station with the photograph of the deceased after five days thereof.	None
In the instant case, which is based on the circumstantial evidence, particularly when the body has not been recovered at the instance of the accused, the recoveries of moped and piece of nylon saree which were made are not proved to be related to commission of offence, they are not proved to be incriminating materials.	Reasoning
The extrajudicial confession made by the appellant to Susheela, P.W.4 is prima facie unusual and doubtful and is not corroborated by other evidence on record.	Reasoning
Merely, the fact that the deceased had left the house on 16.5.2005, as per version of appellant, cannot be used as a circumstance against her so as to fasten guilt.	Reasoning
The deceased used to drink alcohol and used to spend money recklessly.	Reasoning
Due to his bad habits, there may be so many enemies of him.	Reasoning
How the deceased spent the amount of Rs.1,30,000/ which he received on execution of agreement is not on record.	Reasoning
The prosecution has not been able to complete the chain of circumstances so as to fasten the guilt and to prove the commission of offence by the appellant beyond periphery of doubt.	Reasoning
The father of appellant has also been extended benefit of doubt.	Reasoning
As such, the appellant is entitled for benefit of doubt in view of the evidence which has been adduced by the prosecution.	Reasoning
Resultantly, the appeal is allowed.	Decision
The appellant is acquitted giving her the benefit of doubt.	Decision
The judgments and orders of the courts below of conviction and sentence are quashed and set aside.	Decision
