These cases relate to the same subjectmatter and arise out of one and the same proceedings.	None
To appreciate the controversy and the contentions of the parties, a reference to the relevant facts leading to the filing of these cases would be apt.	None
An extent of 825 bighas, 2 kathas, 0 lessa of land in Village Ouguri Chapari under Mouza Morangi, SubDivision Golaghat in the district of Golaghat (for short the acquired land) was notified for acquisition under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short the Act) for the construction of Numaligarh Oil Refinery (hereinafter referred to as the Company) in Notification No.	Facts

In a meeting held in the chamber of the then Chief Minister of Assam on 2521993, it was resolved that for the said compensation, inclusive of solatium, additional interest etc.	Facts
at the rate of Rs. 55, 000 per bigha, would be paid.	Facts
The Company also consented to payment of compensation at the said rate.	Facts
But the process for fixing compensation for the acquired land by agreement of the parties did not materialise as the petitioner, owner of the land, did not accept the said rate.	Facts
The acquisition proceedings were, therefore, continued under the Act and the Collector, Golaghat, proposed compensation for the said land at the rate of Rs. 10, 876 per bigha but the State Government approved Rs. 7000 per bigha only.	Facts
Accordingly, the Collector awarded compensation for the acquired land at the rate of Rs. 7000 per bigha.	Facts
Dissatisfied with the award of the Collector dated 471994, the petitioner sought reference to the civil court under Section 18 of the Act.	Facts
On reference, in LA Case No. 1 of 1996, the District Judge granted enhanced compensation at the rate of Rs. 22, 000 per bigha on 18111996.	None
Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner filed First Appeal No. 27 of 1997 praying for further enhancement of compensation the Company and the Collector, Golaghat, filed First Appeals Nos. 32 and 33 of 1997, respectively, challenging the enhancement of compensation by the District Judge from Rs. 7000 to Rs. 22, 000 per bigha.	Facts
The High Court by its common judgment dated 2461998 dismissed the appeal of the petitioner and allowed the appeals of the respondents in the result, the compensation awarded by the Collector, Golaghat, at the rate of Rs. 7000 per bigha was restored.	Facts
Against that judgment of the High Court, the petitioner filed Review Application No. 54 of 1998 in the High Court.	Facts
He filed Special Leave Petitions (C) Nos. 1802022 of 1998 also seeking leave of this Court to appeal against the said common judgment of the High Court dated 2461998.	Facts
On 831999 he was permitted to withdraw the special leave petitions as his review application in the High Court was pending.	Facts
On 2581999, the said review application was dismissed by the High Court and its order is the subjectmatter of Special Leave Petition (C) No. 5417 of 2000.	None
However, against the said common judgment of the High Court dated 2461998, the petitioner again filed Special Leave Petitions Nos. 1818082 of 1999 delayed by 399 days.	Facts
On 1121999, this Court condoned the delay but dismissed the special leave petitions, which is the subjectmatter of the review petitions.	Facts
Mr. Shanti Bhushan, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner in review petitions and special leave petition, argued that in the chamber of the then Chief Minister, the Company as well as the Collector assessed the compensation for the acquired land at the rate of Rs. 55, 000 per bigha and that being the market value of the land, the Collector in the award ought not to have reduced compensation to Rs. 7000 per bigha.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any event, the compensation enhanced by the District Judge at Rs. 22, 000 per bigha, being far less than the compensation resolved in the chamber of the then Chief Minister, was erroneously set aside by the High Court in appeal.	Arguments of Petitioner
In review application the High Court failed to take note of the fact that relevant documents  Exts.	Arguments of Petitioner
6, 7 and 8 and the communication of 371999  were not taken into consideration in the common judgment and consequently the petitioner was deprived of enhanced compensation at the rate of Rs. 55, 000 per bigha.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the written submissions of the petitioner, in the reply to the affidavit filed on behalf of Respondent 1, the following are the relevant averments 3(c) That in LA Case No. 1 of 199697, Rs. 34, 286 (Rupees ThirtyFour Thousand Two Hundred and EightySix) per bigha was paid to M s.

Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Soli J. Sorabjee, the learned AttorneyGeneral appearing for the respondents, has contended that there is nothing illegal in the order sought to be reviewed, therefore, the review petitions are liable to be dismissed no arguments based on Exts.	Arguments of Respondent
6, 7 and 8 were addressed before the High Court nor was any ground taken in the memorandum of appeal in respect of the said documents, therefore, on the ground of nonconsideration of those documents no review application could be maintained.	Arguments of Respondent
In the written submissions in the affidavit filed by the Director of Land, Requisition, Acquisition and Reforms, Assam, Guwahati, filed on behalf of the first respondent, para 5 reads thus It is submitted that, the mutually agreed valuation of Rs. 55, 000 per bigha by ONGC at Sibsagar District, as stated by the petitioners has been discontinued since 111993.	Arguments of Respondent
The Government decision to this effect, as derived in a meeting on 1991994 is enclosed herewith.	None
The law in regard to review of an order of this Court is too well settled to justify an elaborate discussion on the point.	Reasoning
Suffice it to observe that the finality of the order of the apex court of the country should not lightly be unsettled.	None
A review of a judgment, observed Krishna Iyer, J. in Sow Chandra Kanta v. Sheik Habib (1975 SC 627 1975 AIR(SC) 1500 1975	None
SC	None
627	None
1975	None
SCC(Tax) 2001)	None
May be, we were not right in refusing special leave.	None
A review of a judgment is a serious step and reluctant resort to it is proper only where a glaring omission or patent mistake or like grave error has crept in earlier by judicial fallibility.	None
Now adverting to Review Petitions Nos. 30608 of 2000, we find that they are devoid of any merit.	None
It is noted above that the petitioner having earlier challenged the common judgment of the High Court dated 2461998 in Special Leave Petitions (C) Nos. 1802022 of 1998 withdrew the same with liberty to pursue Review Application No. 54 of 1998 filed in the High Court.	Reasoning
Having lost in the High Court he again sought leave to appeal against the very same common judgment of the High Court by filing Special Leave Petitions (C) Nos. 1818082 of 1999 which were dismissed by this Court on 1121999.	Reasoning
Having withdrawn earlier SLPs Nos. 1802022 of 1998, he could not have been allowed to maintain SLPs Nos. 1818082 of 1999.	None
He cannot, in the guise of the review petitions, be permitted to revive the incompetent special leave petitions.	Reasoning
We are not persuaded to accept the contention that the order of this Court dated 1121999 suffers from any error much less an error on the face of the record there is absolutely no merit in the review petitions.	Reasoning
The review petitions are, therefore, dismissed.	Decision
Special Leave Petition (C) No. 5417 of 2000Leave is granted.	Decision
Printing is dispensed with, the appeal to be heard on the special leave petition paperbook.	None
Parties may file the relevant additional documents, if any, within four weeks.	None
