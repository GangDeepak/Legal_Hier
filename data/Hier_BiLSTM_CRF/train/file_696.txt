I and the sentence therefor was ordained to be rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine of Rs. 5000/, in default, simple imprisonment for further two months.11.	Facts
The learned counsel for the appellants has assiduously argued that the prosecution having failed to prove that the appellants and their co accused had been the aggressors who assaulted the deceased and that he succumbed to the injuries sustained thereby, their conviction and sentence, if allowed to stand, would signify travesty of justice.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, the appellants and the coaccused, while escorting the cattle of the deceased from the fields to the nearby cattle pond, were attacked by him and his cohorts, for which DW1 Shyam Lal had to open fire in self defence.	Arguments of Petitioner
Without prejudice to this, it has been argued that in any view of the matter, there was no premeditation or preconcert on the part of the appellants and the coaccused to attack or assault the deceased and having regard to the incident that had occurred in the fields earlier in the day, the sentence awarded by the High Court is unduly harsh and is liable to be appropriately scaled down in the attendant facts and circumstances.12.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel for the respondent, in refutation, has urged that it having been proved beyond all reasonable doubt by unimpeachable testimony of the eye witnesses, Gaya Prasad (PW1), Sitaram (PW2) and Ram Sajeewan Dhunna (PW4) that the appellants and their coaccused Suraj Bali and Chandra Bali had formed an unlawful assembly and had with the intention of eliminating the deceased, had jointly launched a lethal attack by using, amongst others, a fire arm, the conviction recorded by the High Court, does not merit interference.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him, having regard to the seriousness of the charges proved, the appellants have been let off lightly with the substantive sentence of ten years rigorous imprisonment.13.	Arguments of Respondent
We have lent our due consideration to the materials on record as well as the competing assertions.	None
Noticeably, the findings on the incident are concluded by concurrent deductions of the two courts below.	None
This notwithstanding, we have examined in particular, the evidence of the eye witnesses Gaya Prasad (PW1), Sitaram (PW2) and Ram Sajeewan Dhunna (PW 4) as well as that of the Dr. S.C. Srivastava (PW5), who had performed the postmortem examination on the dead body.	None
A close scrutiny of the evidence of the eye witnesses leaves no manner of doubt that not only they have with noteworthy consistency and cohesion authenticated the case of the prosecution in all material particulars, they have identified as well the appellants and their co accused and also have provided graphic details of the events in the sequence in which the same unfolded at the place of occurrence.	None
The testimony of the Dr. S.C. Srivastava (PW5) reveals fire arm wounds on the head, chest and right upper arm of the deceased together with the multiple abrasions and contusions on various parts of the body.	None
According to this witness, death had occurred due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of the antemortem injuries.	None
Noticeably this witness also referred to lacerated incised wounds and contusions sustained by the appellants Deo Munni, Ram Autar and the co accused Suraj Bali which, according to the medical expert, were however simple in nature.	None
Though an attempt had been made at the trial by the defence to shift the place of occurrence to fit in with their version, as offered in course of the statements under Section 313 Cr.P.C., and urged in course of the arguments, the evidence of the Investigating Officer Brahm Dev Singh (PW 6), when considered along with the sketch map, Ex.	None
A12, the same stands belied.	None
That the place of occurrence was, as cited by the prosecution is, also corroborated by the blood stained earth collected therefrom in course of the investigation.	None
That the blood was human blood also stands proved by the report of the chemical analyst.	None
These proved facts, in a way, demolish the defence version totally in all respects.	None
Though, at the trial as well as before the High Court, the prosecution case was sought to be discredited for the absence of explanation of the injuries suffered by some of the accused persons, in absence of any evidence forthcoming that at the relevant time, the deceased was armed or that the prosecution witnesses present did launch a counter attack, the courts below rightly dismissed this plea.	None
The High Court, noticing the injuries, which the Dr. S.C. Srivastava had identified to be simple in nature, did conclude, had been self inflicted in order to contrive a defence.	None
Bearing in mind the evidence available and the overall scenario, this finding, in our estimate, cannot be repudiated to be absurd or illogical.	None
In the ultimate analysis, however, one cannot overlook the progression of events that occurred since the incident of trespass of the cattle of the deceased in the fields of Suraj Bali and others leading to abuse and unpleasantness between them earlier in the day.	Reasoning
The second bout of bickerings precipitated in the afternoon on the same day while the deceased, appellants and the coaccused were sitting in their respective compounds, abutting each other.	Reasoning
The witnesses of the incident though, at the preliminary stages, did advise the deceased to go in and avoid a brewing confrontation, he obdurately refused to do so and stoked the growing indignation so much so that eventually he was shot at and also assaulted by the appellants and their companions.	Reasoning
The materials on record do suggest that the deceased did also contribute to the escalating tension and in the process the accused persons jointly unleashed attack on him by lathis and also shot him.	Reasoning
A sudden spurt of irreversible events thus got triggered thereby.19.	Reasoning
In the fact situation that developed in quick succession, we are of the comprehension that there was as such no premeditation or prior concert on the part of the accused persons to commit murder of Lalni.	Reasoning
The incident happened on the spur of the moment and in an uncontrollable, embittered and agitated state of enragement, thus depriving the accused persons of their power of self control.	Reasoning
Though during the assaults, the accused persons were understandably aware of the likely results thereof, it is difficult to perceive that they had any common object of eliminating the deceased.	Reasoning
This is more so as the evidence discloses that the accusedappellants, first informant as well as the deceased did descend from a common ancestor and that their grandfathers were real brothers.	Reasoning
The evidence demonstrates that the accused appellants do not have any infamous criminal background as well.	Reasoning
The incident had occurred in the year 1982 and as on date, more than three decades have passed.20.	Reasoning
On a consideration of the totality of the circumstances attendant on the case, we are of the opinion that the conviction of the appellants under Section 304Part 1 read with Sections 147,148,149 IPC, as recorded by the High Court, is justified.	Reasoning
However, in our view, having regard to the singular facts and circumstances, we are inclined to reduce the sentence for the offence under Section 304Part	Decision
I/149 IPC to rigorous imprisonment for 7 years.	Decision
The other sentences are hereby affirmed.21.	Decision
The appeal is thus partly allowed with the above modifications.	Decision
The Trial Court would take the necessary follow up steps to ensure that the appellants serve out the sentence as awarded.	Decision
