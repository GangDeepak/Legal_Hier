the plaintiffcompany inserted in the column pertaining to Price Per Unit that it was subject to salestax at the rate of 1 anna per rupee, but noted in the Remarks column, No sales tax is leviable as per Schedule B.	None
The quotations in this tender were also stated to be subject to the terms and conditions given in the F and A Ministrys letter dated July 6, 1954.	Facts
That was the letter (B1) inviting tenders with which were enclosed Schedules A and B. Supplies were duly made by the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the tender.	Facts

7 of the Special Instructions in Schedule B of the tender invitation.	Facts
It was also pleaded in para 5 of the written statement that the mention of no salestax being leviable (made in the contract of December, 1954 and some others) was discontinued because it was considered redundant.4.	None

They are as follows 2.	Issue
What is the effect of note to clause 7 of the contract ?	Facts
3.	Facts
Whether the plaintiff company is entitled to claim the amount of sales tax from the defendant when it has not mentioned the same in the tenders ?	Issue
5.	Issue
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reimbursement of salestax from the defendant.6.	None
Whether the central Government and the plaintiff were under the bona fide belief that no sales tax would be leviable by the State of Hyderabad and then the State of Andhra Pradesh.	Issue
The trial court dealt with these four issues together.	None
It did not agree with the contention of the Government counsel that if the salestax was payable the plaintiff should have claimed the same in their tenders as a separate item and having not done so they could not claim reimbursement of the salestax paid by them and that the plaintiffs could have found out with reasonable diligence whether or not salestax was leviable on the sales in question.	Facts
In the trial courts opinion the Note to cl.	Facts
7 in Schedule B could by no stretch of imagination be deemed to be a mere expression of opinion.	Facts
In the presence of that Note the plaintiff was held entitled to assume that no salestax was leviable on the goods despatched outside the State.	Facts
The goods, according to the trial court, were eventually despatched and consumed outside the State and the supplies were procured on the Central Government account.	Facts
In the presence of cl. 7 in Schedule B the plaintiff could not have claimed the salestax in the tenders and the trial court also observed that the Note to this clause was very misleading and it indeed did mislead the plaintiff into the belief that no sales tax was leviable on the cigarettes procured for the Central Government and despatched outside the State, otherwise the plaintiff would have felt no difficulty in claiming salestax in the tenders.	Facts
Even in Ex. B5, the letter from the Government of India accepting the plaintiffs tender dated December 11, 1954, it was expressly noted that the sales tax was not payable as despatches would be made outside the State of origin.	Facts
This Note was prominently added against the N.B In the opinion of the trial court even Art. 286 of the Constitution was also wrongly quoted in the Note to Clause 7.	Facts
After taking into account all the relevant circumstances the trial Court felt that it could not be suggested with fairness that the plaintiff company was not free to assume that sales tax was not payable on the despatches of cigarettes made outside the State.	Facts
The plaintiff company was assessed on the sales for the first time in December, 1957 and payment for the last contract had been made on October 31, 1957 with the result that the plaintiff could not have claimed salestax in the tenders, being unaware till assessed, that salestax was payable on these sales.	Facts
The trial Court also took into account the fact that the plaintiff had resisted the levy of salestax right upto the High Court but without success.	Facts
The ultimate conclusion was expressed by that Court in these words The circumstances of the case clearly reveal that not only the plaintiff but also the central Government were under the bona fide belief that no salestax would be levied by the State of Andhra Pradesh as it appears from the averments of the defendant that as the cigarettes were delivered outside the State or Andhra Pradesh for the purpose of consumption outside the State the despatching State could not tax the sales as they were interState sales.	Facts
The plaintiff company in my opinion is therefore entitled to the reimbursement of the salestax from the defendant as they were misled by the representation of the defendant that no sales tax is leviable on the goods despatched outside the State and, therefore, they did not claim the sales tax in the tenders.	Facts
I therefore decided issues 2, 3, 5 and 6 in favour of the plaintiff firm.	None
The plaintiffs suit was decreed, as already noticed.5.	None
The High Court on appeal did not regard Clause 7 as constituting any misrepresentation on the part of the Government and treated that clause at the most as an opinion on a point of law.	Facts
Reimbursement under Clause 7 according to the High Court, could only be claimed if the plaintiff included salestax as chargeable against the buyer in the first instance.	Facts
On this reasoning the defendants appeal was allowed and the plaintiffs suit dismissed.6.	Facts
In this Court Mr. Chagla, the learned counsel for the appellant, strongly contended that the High Court was in error in holding that Cl. 7 merely contained an opinion on a point of law.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was really an assertion on a question of fact or at any rate on a mixed question of fact and law.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him in the very first tender (Ex. B4) the salestax was specified and it was stated in the Remarks Column that the same was not leviable as per Schedule B.	None
In that Schedule as per Clause 7 the Government had unequivocally stated that salestax was not leviable.	Arguments of Petitioner
The plaintiffs tender was accepted by the Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
In subsequent tenders this mention was dropped as being redundant.	Arguments of Petitioner
That this was the reason for the subsequent omission is admitted and indeed in the defendants written statement in para 5 a plea to this effect is taken in positive terms.7.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to Mr. Chagla fixation and payment of the price as also payment of salestax at the rates prescribed by the State Government in the present case, was the core of one of the fundamental obligations undertaken by the defendantpurchaser in lieu of the cigarettes purchased and this clearly signifies payment of salestax by the State Government, if leviable.	Arguments of Petitioner
The circumstances in which the sellerappellant could be deprived of the right of reimbursement was an exemption clause and, therefore, that had to be strictly construed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The exemption clause in the present circumstances, according to his submission cannot be so construed as to deprive the plaintiffs right as seller to claim salestax from the defendant as buyer.8.	Arguments of Petitioner
On behalf of the Union of India, respondent in this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Sanghi referred us to the plaintiffs letter dated December 11, 1954 (Ex. B4), the first offer to supply cigarettes and contended that this was the only contract in which in the column of Price, salestax was mentioned and reference was made in the Remarks Column to Schedule B for excluding the salestax.	Arguments of Respondent
In the subsequent contracts, according to the respondents counsel, there was no such mention.	None
He drew our attention to the subsequent offers to support his submission.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel also relied on the Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar, 1958 SCR 1355 (AIR 1959 SC 452) for the contention that the buyer is under no liability to pay salestax in addition to the agreed sales price there could, therefore, be no question of any agreement on the part of the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff, argued the counsel.	Arguments of Respondent
Finally it was submitted that the High Court had certified the case to be fit for appeal only because of its high valuation and because of the judgment of the High Court being one of reversal the grant of certificate by the High Court does not in the circumstances mean that the case involves any important question of law.	Arguments of Respondent
This Court is, therefore, not obliged to interfere with the decision of the High Court, even if it is considered to be erroneous contended Shri Sanghi.9.	Arguments of Respondent
Dealing with the last argument first, Article 133 (1) confers a right of appeal on an aggrieved party when the case satisfies the requirement of Clause (a) and the judgment of the High Court is one of reversal.	Reasoning
In such a case it is not necessary that, a substantial or important question of law should also be involved.	Reasoning
This Court, therefore, cannot justifiably decline to go into the merits of the appeal on the ground that no substantial question of law is involved.	Reasoning
But this apart, it cannot be said that this appeal does not involve any substantial question of law.10.	Reasoning
Turning to the merits it is clear and indeed it is not disputed that Clause 7 in Schedule B governs the various contracts of sale between the parties.	Reasoning
This clause expressly provides that the price quoted is exclusive of salestax.	None
But salestax was expressly agreed to be paid at the rates prescribed by the State Government concerned.	None
This liability appears to us to be the real core of one of the fundamental terms of the obligation undertaken by the purchaser.	Reasoning
The term that the salestax, if payable, should be shown as a separate item is merely a matter of procedure and the condition that if the salestax intended to be claimed is not distinctly shown then no such claim would be admitted at a later stage is more akin to exemption from this liability.	None
In the case in hand in the very first tender, as already noticed, the plaintiff had actually separately shown in distinct terms that the price per unit stated in column No. 4 was subject to salestax at the rate of 1 anna per rupee.	Reasoning
In the Remarks Column it was again expressly mentioned that no salestax was leviable as per Schedule B.	None
This tender fully complies with Clause 7 both in letter and in spirit even though in our opinion in view of the Note to Clause 7 this mention was scarcely necessary, the salestax not being leviable according to the defendants representation.	Reasoning
In subsequent tenders, if there is no mention of salestax or of the fact that it was not leviable as per Schedule this was due to the fact that it was considered redundant.	None
This, as already noticed, was also admitted by the defendant in the written statement.	Reasoning
The separate mention of salestax which, in our opinion, does not relate to the fundamental term or core of the contract, cannot be considered to deprive the plaintiff of its right to realise the salestax actually held by the salestax department to be leviable and which the defendant had in express terms undertaken to pay.	None
The express and unqualified representation by the defendant in the Note to Clause 7 in Schedule B that salestax was not leviable on these sales was, in our opinion, sufficient to justify the omission on the part of the plaintiff to distinctly show it with the price quoted to be intended to be claimed.	Reasoning
This omission could by no means deprive the plaintiff company of the right under the contract to claim from the defendant sales tax at the prescribed rate actually paid.11.	None
A faint contention was raised on behalf of the defendantrespondent that there was no agreement by the defendant to pay salestax because the cigarettes supplied by the plaintiff were of an inferior quality and therefore, the company must be deemed to have agreed not to charge salestax from the purchaser as is the normal practice in the market.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of this submission reference was made to Ex. B1, a letter dated July 6, 1954, written by the Deputy Director of Purchase, Government of India, Ministry of Food and Agriculture to the plaintiff company.	Arguments of Respondent
All that this letter suggests is that since none of the plaintiffs Brands had been approved, the plaintiff was requested to get its Brands approved from the Director of Supplies and Transport so as to enable the company to quote against the Ministrys future tender enquiries.	Reasoning
This letter does not support the counsels submission.	Reasoning
Apparently after July, 1954 the plaintiff must have got their Brands approved which enabled them to quote against the Ministrys future tender enquiries.	Reasoning
It is not and was never the defendants case that the Brand of cigarettes for which the tenders were actually accepted were of an inferior quality.	Reasoning
This contention is an afterthought and is unacceptable.	Reasoning
It is somewhat surprising that the State Government should have advanced this plea.	Reasoning
Indeed even the main plea which was plainly contrary to the clear and explicit representation of the State Government does not reflect the expected fairness on the part of the defendant in their dealings with the citizens.12.	Reasoning
For the foregoing reasons, in our opinion, the High Court was in error in allowing the appeal and reversing the wellconsidered judgment of the trial Court.	Decision
We accordingly allow the appeal and reversing the judgment and decree of the High Court restore that of the trial Court with costs throughout.13.	Decision
Appeal allowed.	None
