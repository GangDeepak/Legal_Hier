Judge.	Facts
When the Second Appeal No. 697/74 was pending in the High Court, an affidavit was filed on behalf of the appellants (respondents in this Court) on November 16, 1978, drawing attention of the Court to a notification under s.3 of the Bihar Consolidation of Holdings and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956 (Act for short) and further intimating to the Court that the village in which the disputed khatas were situated was taken up for consolidation of holdings and, therefore, the appeal pending in the High Court would abate in view of the provision contained in s. 4 of the Act.	Facts
The High Court accepted the submission and disposed of the appeal by its order dated August 18, 1979, the operative portion of which reads as underThe appeal abates and the judgments and decrees of both the courts below are hereby set aside as having abated.4.	Facts
Original plaintiffs having been dissatisfied by the order of the High Court not only abating the second appeal preferred by the respondents but also setting aside the judgments and decrees of the trial court and the first appellate court as having abated, have preferred this appeal by special leave.5.	Issue
Shri B.P. Singh, learned counsel who appeared for the appellants contended that even if the Second Appeal abates by virtue of the provision contained in s. 4, on issue of a notification under s. 3 of the Act, the High Court cannot set aside the judgments and decrees o f the trial court and the first appellate court as according to him when an appeal abates the judgment and decree of the court against which the appeal is preferred becomes final.	Arguments of Petitioner
The second contention of the learned counsel is that in any view of the matter as the present respondents had no interest in khata no.	Arguments of Petitioner
458 and as Brahmadeo on sale to him by Deonandan Singh alone claimed interest in khata no.	Arguments of Petitioner
458 and since the death of Brahmadeo when the first appeal was pending and his heirs and legal representatives having not been substituted, the appeal qua him in respect of khata no.	Arguments of Petitioner
458 had abated and the present respondents could not have preferred appeal in respect of khata no. 458 and, therefore, the High Court could not have s et aside the decree in respect of khata	Arguments of Petitioner
no.	Facts
458.Section 3 of the Act confers power on the State Government to make a declaration of its intention to frame a scheme for consolidation of holdings.	Arguments of Petitioner
When the State Government entertains a n intention to make a scheme for consolidation of holdings in a given village, it has to issue a notification declaring its intention to make a scheme for the consolidation of holdings in the specified area.	None
Section 4 provides that upon the publication of a notification under subs.	None
(1) of s. 3, the consequences enumerated in s. 4 shall ensue.	None
One such consequence is as set out in subclause (c) which reads as under4.	None
Effect of notification under section 3(1) of the ActUpon the publication of the notification under subsection (1) of section 3 in the official Gazette the consequences, as hereinafter set forth, shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, from the date specified in the notification till the close of the consolidation operations ensue in the area to which the notification relates, namely(c) every proceeding for the correction of records and every suit and proceedings in respect of declaration of rights of interest in any land lying in the area or for declaration or adjudication of any other right in regard to which proceedings can or ought to be taken under this Act, pending before any court or authority whether of the first instance or of appeal, reference or revision, shall, on an order being passed in that behalf by the court or authority before whom such suit or proceeding is pending, stand abated.6.	None
There are as many as 5 provisos to clause (c) of s. 4 but only one is material which reads as underProvided further that such abatement shall be with out prejudice to the rights of the persons affected to agitate the right or interest in dispute in the said suits or proceedings before the appropriate consolidation authorities under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder.7.	None
Present appeal arises out of a suit filed by the present appellants, who were plaintiffs, for a declaration of their title and consequential relief of possession meaning that it was a suit concerning agricultural land to which title was claimed and disputed.	None
This suit was pending in Second Appeal at the instance of the respondents when the notification under s. 3 (1) came to be issued.	None
Accordingly, s. 4 (c) would be attracted and the necessary consequence statutorily prescribed, must ensue.	None
Therefore, it is incontrovertible that the second appeal would abate.	None
Shri Singh, learned counsel for the appellants does not dispute this legal consequence.8.	None
The grievance of Shri Singh is that the High Court while making an order declaring that the second appeal has abated, was in error in setting aside the judgments and decrees of the trial court as well as of the first appellate court which were in favour of the present appellants on the ground that those proceedings have also abated.	None
At first blush this argument is very attractive but if accepted it has a potentiality of doing irreparable harm.9.	None
When a scheme of consolidation is undertaken, the Act provides for adjudication of various claims to land involved in consolidation by the authorities set up under the Act.	None
In order to permit the authorities so pursue adjudication of rival claims to land unhampered by any proceedings in civil courts, a wholesome provision was made that the pending proceedings involving claims to land in the hierarchy of civil courts, may be in the trial court, appeal or revision, should abate.	None
This pro vision was made with a view to ensuring unhampered adjudication of claims to land before the authorities under the Consolidation Act without being obstructed by proceedings in civil courts or without being hampered or impeded by decisions of the civil courts in the course of consolidation of holdings.	None
In order to avoid conflict consequent upon rival jurisdictions the legislature provided that the proceedings involving the claims to land put in consolidation should be exclusively examined by the authorities under the Consolidation Act and all rival jurisdiction would be closed.	None
Simultaneously it was necessary to deal with the pending proceedings and that is why the provision for abatement of such proceedings.	None
The concept of abatement is known to civil law.	None
If a party to a proceeding either in the trial court or any appeal or revision dies and the right to sue survives or a claim has to be answered, the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased party would have to be substituted and failure to do so would result in abatement of proceedings.	None
Now, if the party to a suit dies and the abatement takes place, the suit would abate.	None
If a party to an appeal or revision dies and either the appeal or revision abates, it will have no impact on the judgment, decree or order against which the appeal or revision is preferred.	None
In fact, such judgment, decree or order under appeal or revision would become final.	None
Such is not the scheme of abatement as conceived by s. 4 of the Act.	None
Here, if the abatement as is conceptually understood in the Code of Civil Procedure is imported, it will do irreparable harm.	None
To illustrate, if an appeal abates rendering either the trial court judgment or the judgment in first appeal final and binding, the consolidation authorities would also be bound by it and the party whose appeal or revision abated would lose its chance of persuading the appellate or revisional authority	None
t o accept its case which may result in interfering with or setting aside the judgment, order or decree in appeal.	None
Such was not and could not be the intention of s. 4.	None
This becomes manifestly clear from the proviso to clause (c) of s. 4 extracted hereinabove which shows that such abatement shall be without prejudice to the rights of the person affected to agitate the rights or interest in dispute in the suit or proceeding before the appropriate consolidation authorities under an d in accordance with the provisions of the Act.	None
No one would, therefore, stand to suffer on account of the abatement because there is a special forum carved out for adjudication of the rights which were involved in proceedings which would abate as a consequence of the notification under s. 3.	None
If the construction as canvassed for were to be adopted it would result in irreparable harm and would be counterproductive.	None
The consolidation work would be wholly hampered and a part y whose appeal is pending would lose the chance of convincing the appellate court which, if successful, would turn the tables against the other party in whose favour the judgment, decree or order would become final on abatement of the appeal.	None
Therefore, the legislature intended that not only the appeal or revision would abate but the judgment, order or decree against which the appeal is pending would also become honest as they would also abate and this would leave consolidation authority free to adjudicate the claims of title or other rights or interest in land involved in consolidation.	None
In our opinion, therefore, the High Court was right in not only holding that the second appeal pending before it abated but also the judgm ent and decree of the trial court and first appellate court would stand abated along with those proceedings.	Reasoning
We reach this conclusion on the language of ss. 3 and 4 and the scheme of the Act but the view which we are taking is also borne out by some decisions though in none of them this position was directly canvassed.	Reasoning
In Ram Adhar Singh v. Ramroop Singh Ors., this Court examined the effect of a provision in pari materia in a parallel statute, namely, s. 5 of the Uttar Pradesh Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 (U. P. Act for short).	Reasoning
Section 5 provided for the consequences of a declaration of intention to prepare a scheme for consolidation of holdings made under s. 4.	Reasoning
As the section stood prior to its amendment in 1966, it did not provide for abatement of proceedings pending in civil courts at the commencement of consolidation proceedings.	Reasoning
By the Amending Act 21 of 1966, s. 5 was amended introducing subs.	Reasoning
(2)(a) to provide for abatement of pending pro ceedings.	Reasoning
This section is in pari materia with s. 4 (c) of Act.	Reasoning
At the time of the issue of the notification an appeal by special leave was pending in this Court and a notice of motion was taken out requesting the Court to pass an order ab ating the appeal after taking note of subs.	Reasoning
(2)(a) introduced by the Amending Act of 1966.	Reasoning
After negativing the contention challenging the constitutional validity of the Amending Act, this Court held that the suit out of which the appe al came to the Court would stand abated in view of subs.	Reasoning
(2) (a) introduced in s. 5.	Reasoning
The emphasis is that not only would the appeal pending in this Court abate but the suit as a whole abated.	Reasoning
True it is that no contention was taken whether only t he appeal would abate keeping the judgment under appeal intact or the suit as a whole would abate, but the observation of this Court will clearly indicate that in the opinion of this Court the suit as such would abate rendering the appeal p ending before this Court infructuous.	None
This decision in Ram Adhar Singhs case supra was in terms followed in Chattar Singh Ors.	None
v. Thakur Prasad Singh.	None
The appeal in Chattar Singhs case related to a suit which had a reference to a claim to the land in respect of which a notification was issued under the U.P. Act as amended by Act 21 of 1966.	None
The notification was issued when the appeal was pending before this Court.	None
The appellants moved for passing an order of abatement.	None
Granti ng the motion, this Court held that the suit and the appeals stood abated, leaving it open to the parties to work out the rights before the appropriate authorities under the U. P. Act.	None
Both the aforementioned decisions were noticed in Saty anarayan Prasad Sah and others v. State of Bihar and another.	None
In that case upon the issue of a notification under s. 3 of the Act at a time when the matter was pending in the High Court an order was made under s. 4 (c) abating the proceeding as al so the suit from which the proceeding arose.	None
Writ Petitions were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution questioning the constitutional validity of s. 4 of the Act as being violative of Arts.	None
14 and 19 of the Constitution.	None
After repelli ng the challenge to the vires of s. 4 this Court affirming the decisions in Ram Adhar SIngh and Chattar Singhs case (supra) held that maybe that the High Court should not have nullified the decree of the trial court but should have merely declared that the proceeding stood abated which this Court understood to mean that the civil proceeding comes to a naught.	None
In other words, the proceedings from its commencement abate and no decision in the proceeding at any stage would have any impac t on the adjudication of claims by the parties under the Act.	None
Accordingly, both on principle and precedent it is crystal clear that where a notification is issued bringing the land involved in a dispute in the civil proceeding under a scheme o f consolidation the proceedings pending in the civil court either in the trial court, appeal or revision, shall abate as a consequence ensuing upon the issue of a notification and the effect of abatement would be that the civil proceeding as a whole would come to a naught.	Reasoning
Therefore, the order of the High Court impugned in this appeal is legal and valid so far as it not only directed abatement of the appeal pending before the High Court but also abating the judgments and de crees of the trial court and the first appellate court because the entire civil proceeding came to naught.10.	Reasoning
The next contention of Shri Singh was that the High Court ought not to have nullified the decree with regard to khata no.	None
458 in which Brahmadeo and Deonandan Singh, defendants 7 and 5 respectively, alone were interested and the present respondents had no interest in khata no.	Arguments of Petitioner
458.	Decision
Learned counsel who appeared for the respondents conceded that the present respondent s have no interest in khata no. 458.	Arguments of Respondent
It also transpires that Brahmadeo claimed interest in khata no.	Reasoning
458 alleging that he had purchased the land involved in the khata from Deonandan Singh, defendant 5.	Reasoning
The suit proceeded exparte against defend ants 5 and 6 and Brahmadeo, defendant 7 contested the suit in respect of khata no. 458.	Reasoning
The trial court negatived the contention of defendant 7 Brahmadeo and accepted plaintiffs title.	Reasoning
Defendant 7 Brahmadeo along with other defendants p referred an appeal to the District Court.	Reasoning
When the appeal was pending in the District Court, Brahmadeo, the appellant died.	Reasoning
His legal representatives were not substituted.	Reasoning
Since defendant 7 Brahmadeo as appellant claimed separate, specific and exc lusive right to khata no. 458, on his death his legal representatives ought to have been substituted.	Reasoning
He was the appellant.	Reasoning
No one was substituted on his behalf.	Reasoning
Obviously, therefore, the appeal preferred by Brahmadeo abated.	Reasoning
It may also be made c lear that legal representatives of Brahmadeo have not preferred second appeal.	Reasoning
Second Appeal was preferred by the present respondents who claimed interest in khata no.	Reasoning
459 only.	Reasoning
Accordingly, when the appeal preferred by the present respondents abated, it only abated with reference to khata no.	Reasoning
459	Reasoning
and in no case it would have any impact on the title of present appellants which became established under a decree of the trial court which became final on the appeal of Brahmadeo hav ing abated before the notification under s. 3, and it could not at all be dealt with by the High Court.	Reasoning
To that extent this appeal will have to be allowed and an appropriate modification would have to be made.	Reasoning
Accordingly, this appeal succeeds in part.	Reasoning
Proceedings with regard to khata	Reasoning
no. 459	Reasoning
(Bhouli) in Touzi 7535, village Parsain were rightly abated by the High Court and the civil proceeding with regard to khata no.	Reasoning
459 as a whole would abate leaving the parties to get their rights adjudicated before the authorities under the Act.	Reasoning
The title of the appellants declared by the trial court in respect of khata no. 458	None
(nakdi) has become unchallengeable at the hands of Brahmadeo or anyone claiming through him and the abatement of the second appeal will have no impact on the title of the appellants to khata no.	Decision
458.	Decision
The declaration made by the trial court in respect of khata no. 458 is restored.	Decision
In the circumstances of the case there will be no order as to costs.11.	Decision
Appeals allowed in part.	None
