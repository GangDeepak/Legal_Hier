The learned Single Judge referred to the sale deed Exhibit P1 and opined that the same reflected market value which a willing buyer would have paid to a willing seller.	Facts
The reasons assigned by the learned Single Judge for arriving at this conclusion are extracted below The claimants have produced various sale instances to prove their claim.	Facts
Sale deed Ex.	Facts
Pl is dated September 16, 1994 whereby 96 kanals and 13 marlas ( more than 12 acres ) of land in village Naharpur Kasan was sold by the owner, M s. Heritage Furniture Private Limited to M s .Dura	Facts
Cell India Private Limited for a sale consideration of Rs,.2,42,00,000/, reflecting the average price of Rs,20,03,103/ per acre.	Facts
The aforesaid sale instance has been proved by the statement of one Albel Singh PWl, who at the relevant time was the authorised signatory of the seller Company, M s. Heritage Furniture Private Limited.	Facts
The aforesaid witness has clearly proved that the said transaction was genuinely entered between the two companies and the entire payment was made through bank drafts.	Facts
The factum of the payment having been made through bank drafts is also reflected in the sale deed Ex.Pl.	Facts
Some other sale instances relied upon by the claimants are Ex.P2, P3, P4, P7 and P8.	Facts
Vide Ex.	Facts
P2 land measuring 9 kanals was sold on June 4, 1994 for consideration of Rs.7,87,500/, reflecting an average price of Rs.7 lacs per acre.	Facts
Similarly Ex.P3 is also dated June 24, 1994 pertaining to sale of 10 kanals 10 marlas of land reflecting average sale price of Rs,7,00,000/ Ex.P4 is dated October 25,1991 whereby land measuring 9 kanals 9 marlas in Manesar was sold for Rs. 9,15,470/ reflecting an average price of Rs,7,75,000/ per acre.	Facts
Ex.P7 and Ex.P8 are also the sale instances dated June 24, 1994 with regard land measuring 9 marlas each reflecting an average price of Rs,7,00,000/per acre.	Facts
The remaining sale instances Ex.P9 and P13 are of the year 1996 i.e. more than two years after the date of notification under section 4 of the Act.	Facts
Similarly the sale instances Ex.Pl0, P11 and PI2 pertain to the sale of land in village Noorangpur.	Facts
The said sale instances are, thus, not relevant.	Facts
On the other hand, the sale instances relied upon by the State are Ex.	Facts
Rl to Ex.	Facts
R15	Facts
but they have rightly been rejected by the reference court itself on the ground that the said sale instance reflected an average price which is even less than the one assessed by the Collector and, as such, in view of the provisions of section 25 of the Act, the same were not relevant and worth consideration.	Facts
As noticed above, the land which was acquired in the present proceedings is approximately 1500 acres.	Facts
The sale instance Ex.	Facts
Pl in my considered view, reflects as near as possible, the market value of the acquired land on the date of notification under section 4 of the Act.	Facts
The said sale had taken place on September 16,1994.	Facts
The recitals in the sale deed reflect that there was a prior agreement between the two companies on May 31, 1994 with regard to the sale of the land.	Facts
It is also recited in the sale deed that the entire sale consideration was paid by the purchaser company to the seller company by bank drafts.	Facts
The aforesaid fact is also proved by Albel Singh, PWl.	Facts
In this view of the matter, since the aforesaid transaction was between two companies, then obviously , there is no justification to doubt the authenticity of the said sale transaction.	Facts
Moreover, the land covered under the aforesaid sale transaction is a big chunk of land i.e more than 12 acres.	Facts
The said land was situated in village Naharpur Kasan i.e. one of the villages from which the present land was also acquired.	Facts
In these circumstances to my mind, the said sale instance could not have been rejected by the reference Court, in any manner.	Facts
Although the other sale instances Ex. P2, P3, P7 and P8 reflect the market price of Rs.7 lacs per acre but it is also apparent that the aforesaid transactions pertain to small piece of land and are between private persons.	Facts
In these circumstances, the possibility of the aforesaid sale deeds being undervalued, with a view to save stamp duty and registration charges, can also not be ruled out.	Facts
However, there is no justification to prefer the aforesaid sale deeds Ex.P2, P3, P7 and P8 over and above the sale deed Ex.Pl which is a transaction between the two cooperate bodies and wherein the entire sale consideration had been paid through bank drafts.	Facts
The aforesaid sale also pertains to a big chunk of land i.e. more than 12 acres.	Facts
It may also be noticed that the acquired land was owned by approximately more than 350 persons, thus each having a small holding.	Facts
Therefore, the saledeed Ex.	Facts
Pl duly reflects the market value, which a willing buyer would have paid to a willing seller.	Facts

The appeals filed by the landowners affected by the first acquisition were disposed of by the learned Single Judge vide judgment dated 5.9.2008.	Facts
He referred to judgment dated 19.5.2006 but applied the cut of 20 and fixed market value of the acquired land at the rate of Rs.12 lakhs per acre.2.6.	Facts
The petitioner had challenged the judgments of the High Court on several grounds but the only point argued by the learned senior counsel appearing on its behalf was that the High Court committed serious error by determining market value of the acquired land solely on the basis of Exhibit P1 ignoring other sale deeds by which similar parcels of land were sold at the rate of Rs.7 lakhs per acre or less.	Facts
This is evinced from the following extracts of the judgment under review Shri Amarendera Sharan, learned Senior Counsel and Shri Ravindra Bana, learned counsel appearing for the Corporation argued that the High Court committed serious error by fixing market value of the acquired land at Rs. 15 lakhs per acre in one batch of appeals and Rs. 12 lakhs in the other batch of appeals by relying upon the sale deed, Ext. P1 excluding other sale transactions, which were produced before the Reference Court.	None
The learned counsel submitted that the value of 12 acres of land which was sold by Ext. P1 was wholly disproportionate to the prevailing market value and, therefore, the same could not be made basis for fixing market value of the acquired land measuring more than 1490 acres.	None
Shri Amarendera Sharan emphasised that actual market value of the acquired land was not more than Rs. 7 lakhs and the High Court committed serious error by discarding other sale transactions through which similar parcels of land were sold for Rs. 7 lakhs or less.	None
The learned Senior Counsel submitted that if the High Court had given due weightage to other sale transactions, market value of the acquired land could not have been fixed at Rs. 15 lakhs or even Rs. 12 lakhs per acre.	None
2.7.	None
This Court rejected the aforesaid argument and observed In our view, the learned Single Judge did not commit any error by relying upon sale transaction Exhibit P1 for the purpose of fixing market value of the acquired land.	Facts
Undisputedly, that sale transaction was between two corporate entities and the entire sale price was paid through bank drafts.	Facts
It is also not in dispute that the land which was subject matter of Exhibit P1 is situated at village Naharpur Kasan and is adjacent to the acquired land.	Facts
The Corporation and the State Government did not adduce any evidence to prove that the land sold vide	Facts
Exhibit P1 was over valued with an oblique motive of helping the land owners to claim higher compensation.	Facts
Therefore, we do not find any justification to discard or ignore sale deed Exhibit P1.	Facts
The refusal of the learned Single Judge to rely upon other sale transactions in which sale price of the land was shown as Rs.7 lakhs per acre also does not suffer from any legal infirmity because it is wellknown that transactions involving transfer of properties are usually undervalued with a view to avoid payment of the requisite stamp duty and registration charges.	Facts
With a view to generate funds necessary for payment of additional compensation to the landowners, the petitioner increased the cost of land to be allotted to the prospective industrial entrepreneurs and others.	Facts
IMT Industrial Association, which claims to be a representative body of the plot holders protested against this decision of the petitioner and persuaded it to seek review of judgment dated 17.8.2010.9.	Facts
In the review petitions filed on behalf of the petitioner, which were registered as Review Petition Nos.21072108 of 2010, it was pleaded that the determination of market value needs reconsideration because the sale deed Exhibit P1 on which reliance was placed by the High Court and this Court was not a genuine transaction.	Facts
According to the petitioner,	Facts
M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt. Ltd. and M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. were controlled by the same management and this fact was brought to the notice of the concerned officers only after disposal of the appeals by this Court.	Facts
IMT Industrial Association filed I.A.Nos.5 and 6 for impleadment as party to the review petitions.	Facts
This Court dismissed the review petitions and the impleadment applications vide order dated 13.1.2011, paragraphs 4 to 8 of which are extracted below In the review petitions, it has been averred that the sale transaction dated 16.9.1994, upon which reliance was placed by the learned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and by this Court for grant of enhanced compensation was motivated because parties to the transaction were under the control and management of the common board of directors and this fact came to the notice of the review petitioner only after dismissal of the appeals by this Court.5.	Facts
In paragraph A of the grounds of the review petitions, the review petitioner has referred to the composition of M s. Dura Cell India Private Limited and Heritage Furniture Private Limited to show that both the companies have common management.6.	Facts
The review petition is supported by an affidavit of Shri Hamvir Singh, Deputy General Manager (I.A.),	Facts
Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd.	Facts
In paragraph 2 of his affidavit, the deponent has stated that contents of the review petition (pages 25 to 43), list of dates (pages B to P) and other applications are true to my knowledge and the information derived from records of the case.	Facts
However, he has not enclosed any document on the basis of which this assertion has been made.7.	Facts
We have carefully perused the entire record and are convinced that the judgment of which review has been sought does not suffer from any error apparent warranting its reconsideration.	Facts
The review petitioner has not produced any material to substantiate its assertion that the price mentioned in the sale deed relied upon by the courts was manipulated with an oblique motive.	Facts
Hence, the review petitions are dismissed.8.	Facts
The application filed by IMT Industrial Association is wholly misconceived.	Facts
The members of the applicant are beneficiaries of the acquisition of the land because plots have been allotted to them out of the acquired land which belong to the respondents and others.	Facts
Therefore, they do not have the locus standi to be heard in the proceedings relating to determination of market value of the acquired land and that too in a petition filed by the Corporation for review of the judgment of this Court.	Facts
It is not the pleaded case of the applicant that its members were not aware of the fact that the plots have been carved out of the land acquired by the State Government for and on behalf of the Corporation and that the price mentioned in the allotment letter was tentative and further that in paragraph 5 of the allotment letter, it was specifically mentioned that they will have to pay additional price in the event of enhancement in the compensation.	Facts
It is quite surprising that members of the applicantAssociation paid price of the plots at the rate of Rs.2200/ per square yard and they are objecting to the payment of compensation to the land owners at the rate of less than Rs.500/ per square yard.	Facts
This shows that members of the applicant want to take advantage of the measure taken by the State Government for compulsory acquisition of the land of the farmers and want to deprive them of just and reasonable compensation.	Facts
Consequently, the impleadment application is dismissed.	Facts
Soon thereafter, the petitioner filed these petitions by reiterating that sale deed Exhibit P1 dated 16.9.1994 executed by	Facts
M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt. Ltd. in favour of M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. was not a bona fide transaction and the High Court and this Court committed serious error by relying upon the same for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation.	Facts
In paragraph A of the review petition, the petitioner has set out the brief history of the two companies and pleaded that at the time of the execution of sale deed both the entities were under the control of the same set of persons.	Facts
It has also been averred that the facts relating to composition of the Board of Directors of two companies could not be ascertained by exercising due diligence and the true nature of Exhibit P1 was revealed only after the judgment of this Court.	Facts
According to the petitioner, M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt. Ltd. had purchased different parcels of land from the farmers by executing 10 different sale deeds executed on 16th and 18th August, 1993 at an average price of Rs.6 lakhs per acre and, as such, there was no occasion for M s. Duracell India Pvt.	Facts
Ltd. to have purchased the same land just after one year at the rate of Rs.20,03,103/ per acre.	Facts
It is the petitioners case that exorbitant price is shown to have been paid by the vendee to the vendor because its Indian promoters were to be benefited by the proposed joint venture between the Indian company and M s. Duracell Inc. USA.	Facts
Another ground taken by the petitioner is that sale deeds Exhibits P2, P3, P4, P7 and P8, three of which were executed in June, 1994 and one in October, 1991 at an average price of Rs.7 lakhs per acre reflected true market value of the acquired land and in the absence of any cogent evidence, the High Court and this Court could not have discarded the same by assuming that the same were undervalued.4.	Facts
On 30.3.2011, this Court issued notice to the landowners and granted stay subject to certain conditions which included a direction to the Managing Director of the petitioner to file an affidavit and disclose the names of the officers officials responsible for not bringing the facts relating to Exhibit P1 to the notice of the High Court and this Court.	Facts
In compliance of that order, Shri Rajiv Arora, the Managing Director of the petitioner filed affidavit dated 27.7.2011 in which he did not disclose the names of the concerned officers officials but claimed that the functionaries of the Corporation did not suspect the bona fides of the sale deed executed between M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt. Ltd. and M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd.	Facts
because the same was a registered instrument and they did not know that the two companies were controlled by the same set of persons.	Facts
Shri Arora further claimed that the facts relating to two companies were brought to the notice of the concerned officers by the representatives of the Manesar Industrial Welfare Association, who were given opportunity of personal hearing in compliance of the order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Writ Petition No.6527/2010.	Facts
According to Shri Arora, the information made available by the Association was got verified from the records of the Registrar of Companies and the same was found to be correct.	Facts

Some of the landowners have filed reply affidavits.	Facts
Their stand is that Exhibit P1 reflected true market value of the acquired land as on the date of issue of notifications under Section 4(1) and that the petitioners assertion that the transaction was not genuine is not correct.	Facts
They have denied that the vendor and vendees were under the control of the same management and that exorbitantly high price was paid for 12 acres land in anticipation of some collaboration between M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. and M s. Duracell Inc. USA, which would have benefited the former.	Facts
With a view to avoid repetition, we may notice the averments contained in paragraphs 4 to 9 of the reply affidavit filed in Review Petition No.239/2011 and paragraph 5 of the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the landowners who were respondents in Civil Appeal No.6561/2009.	Facts

D. C. Rastogi sold the said land in terms of agreement to sell dt.6.12.1993 vide sale deed dated 16.3.1994 at the rate of about Rs.15,73,289/ per acre.	Facts
This shows that there was a jump in the price of the land in that area equal to almost 11 times of the original price.	Facts
It is also common knowledge that the parties often undervalue the land price in order to minimize stamp duty and the land might have been sold at a higher price.	Facts
Copy of sale deed dt.	Facts
16.3.1994 is Annexure R2 hereto.	Facts
Thus if M s Heritage Furniture Pvt.	Facts
Ltd. purchased land, which is subject matter of sale deed dt.16.9.1994, Ex.P.1, in the year 1993 at a price of about Rs.6 lakhs per acre as alleged by the review petitioner even though there is no evidence of purchase at such rate then its value increasing to Rs.20 lakhs per acre in the year 1994 is commensurate with the market trend.	Facts
Moreover agreement to sell dt.31.5.1994 was executed after first notification u s 4 on 30.4.1994 and it is a common knowledge that after publication of section 4 notification, the value of the land increases.5.	Facts
It is further submitted that vide sale deed dt.14.12.1993 (Ex.P.10) one M s. DCN Internatinal Ltd. sold land measuring 62 kanals 7 marlas situated in Village Naurangpur District Gurgaon for Rs.95,21,160/ i.e. at the rate of Rs.13,74,345/ per acre.	Facts
Copy of sale deed dt.	Facts
14.12.1993 is Annexure R.3 hereto.6.	Facts
I further state that sale deed dt. 16.9.1994 (Ex.P.1) was executed pursuant to agreement to sell dt.31.5.1994 between M s Heritage Furniture Pvt. Ltd. (vendor) and	Facts
M s Duracell (India) Pvt. Ltd. (vendee) wherein the vendor agreed to sell the land in question measuring about 12 acres to the vendee at a sale price of Rs.2,42,00,000/ (Rs.	Facts
Two crore forty lakhs only) as is clear from the recital in the sale deed itself.	Facts
Ultimately vide sale deed dt.16.9.1994 the said land was sold at the same sale price by the vendor to the vendee.	Facts
Thus the sale price of the land was agreed upon and fixed on 31.5.1994 as is clear from the recitation of the sale deed itself.7.	Facts
I further state that as per assertion of the review petitioner M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt.	Facts
(vendor) and M s Duracell (India) Pvt. Ltd.	Facts
(vendee) had common persons in their Board of Directors namely Sh.	Facts
Saroj Kumar Poddar, Ms. Jyotsana Poddar and Sh.	Facts
Gurvinder Singh Gill.	Facts
The review petitioner has filed search reports of both the said companies to show that the abavoe said three persons were common directors of both the companies.	Facts
However, from the said search report of M s. Duracell (India) Pvt.	Facts
Ltd.	Facts
it is clear the two directors namely Sh.	Facts
Saroj Kumar Poddar and Ms. Jyotsana Poddar were appointed as Directors of this company on 9.6.1994 whereas Sh.	Facts
Gurvinder Singh gill was appointed as its Director on 9.2.1997.	Facts
Thus all the three alleged common Directors of the vendor and vendee companies were not on the Board of Directors of M s Duracell (India) Pvt.	Facts
Ltd. on or before 31.5.1994 on which date	Facts
the agreement to sell of the land in question was executed and the sale price was fixed.	Facts
The said three directors had no interest in M s. Duracell (India) Pvt. Ltd. (vendee) as on 31.5.1994 when the sale price of the land was fixed.8.	Facts
I further state that except for making a bald allegation that the sale price of the said land was inflated intentionally so that the vendee company would increase its share holding in a Joint Venture it was going to enter into with one Duracell INC USA, this assertion has not been substantiated by placing ay cogent evidence on record.	Facts
So much so that even it has not been pleaded in the review petition as to whether Joint Venture between M s Duracell (India) Pvt. Ltd. and M s. Duracell INC USA did take place or not.	Facts
To the knowledge of the deponent there was no joint venture between M s. Duracell (India) Pvt. Ltd. and M s. Duracell INC USA.	Facts
This fact that there was no Joint Venture between the said two companies also stands proved from the fact that the land purchased vide said sale deed dt.16.9.1994 was sold by M s Duracell (India) Pvt.	Facts

It is submitted by the respondents land owners that the said sale deed (Ex.P.1) reflects true market price of the land in the year 1994 when section 4 notifications for the acquired land was issued.	Facts
The allegation of the review petitioner that the sale deed (Ex.P.1) reflects inflated price is false and baseless.	Facts
It is further submitted that another sale deed dt.17.7.1996 which is on record as (Ex.P.9) reflects the market value of the land in one of the acquired villages at Rs.25,00,000/ (Rs. Twenty five lakhs) per acre.	Facts
In this transaction 1 kanal 11 marlas of land situated in Village Naharpur Kasan, has been sold at a price of Rs.4,84,375/.	Facts

S Shri Gopal Subramanium and Altaf Ahmed, learned senior advocates and other counsel who appeared for the petitioner relied upon reports dated 20.1.2011 and 21.1.2011 prepared by the Chartered Accountant M s. AKG and Company to show that at least two of the Directors, namely, Shri Saroj Kumar Poddar and Ms. Jyotsana Poddar were common to the management of the two companies and submitted that land was shown to have been purchased by M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. at a very high price because it was hoping to reap benefit of the joint venture agreement with M s. Duracell Inc. USA.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel pointed out that the vendor, namely, M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt. Ltd. had purchased 12 acres land from different landowners at an average price of Rs.6 lakhs per acre and argued that even if the benefit of 12 notional increase in the value of land was allowed to the vendor, no person of ordinary prudence would have purchased the same land after a period of 13 months at the rate of more than Rs.20 lakhs per acre.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel also referred to the statement of the authorised signatory of the vendor M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ltd. to drive home the point that the Sale Deed Exhibit P1 was not a bona fide transaction.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel then argued that dismissal of Review Petition Nos.21072108 of 2010 cannot operate as a bar to the maintainability of these petitions because till 13.1.2011, the officers of the petitioner did not have any inkling about the composition of the two companies and the fact that the vendor had purchased the land in 1993 at the rate of Rs.6 lakhs per acre only and the relevant facts came to their notice only in October, 2010 from the representatives of IMT Industrial Association.7.	Arguments of Petitioner
S Shri J.L. Gupta, S.R. Singh, P.S. Patwalia and Paras Kuhad, senior advocates and other counsel, who appeared for the landowners argued for dismissal of the review petitions.	Arguments of Respondent
They emphasized that the very premise on which the review petitions have been filed, namely, discovery of the facts relating to composition of the board of directors of the two companies is incorrect because noone from the Poddar group on the board of directors of M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. till 9.6.1994.	Arguments of Respondent

Shri Paras Kuhad also referred to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of M s. Duracell India Pvt.	Arguments of Respondent
Ltd. to show that S Shri Jyoti Sagar and Sajay Singh were the only promoters of the company.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel then argued that the petitioner cannot seek review of judgment dated 17.8.2010 on the pretext of discovery of facts relating to composition of the two companies because no evidence was adduced before the Reference Court to prove that the sale deed Exhibit P1 was not a bona fide transaction or that vendee had paid exorbitant price for extraneous reasons.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel further argued that after dismissal of Review Petition Nos.21072108 of 2010, the petitioner cannot revive its prayer because there was total absence of diligence on the part of its officers.8.	Arguments of Respondent
We shall first consider whether the petitioners prayer for review should be entertained by ignoring the dismissal of similar petitions by this Court vide order dated 13.1.2011.	None
A careful reading of that order shows that in Review Petition Nos.21072108 of 2010, the petitioner had sought reconsideration of judgment dated 17.8.2010 on the premise that the vendor and the vendee had common management and that the price mentioned in the sale deed had been manipulated with an oblique motive.	None
The Court declined to entertain this plea by observing that the petitioner had not produced any material to substantiate its assertion.	None
Along with the present batch of review petitions, the petitioner has placed on record the search reports prepared by M s AKG and Company, Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt. Ltd., mutations showing the purchase of land by M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt.	None
Ltd. vide sale deeds dated 16.8.1993 and 18.8.1993, annual return of M s. Duracell India Pvt	None
. Ltd.	Facts
showing Shri Saroj Kumar Poddar, Shri Gurbunder Singh Gill and Ms. Jyotsana Poddar as the Directors and the statement of Albel Singh, but these documents neither singularly nor collectively support the petitioners plea that management of the two companies, i.e., the vendor and the vendee, was under the control of the same set of persons or that the vendee had paid unusually high price with some oblique motive.	None
As a matter of fact, Shri Saroj Kumar Poddar and Ms. Jyotsana Poddar were appointed as Directors of M s. Duracell India Pvt.	None
Ltd. on 9.6.1994	Facts
and Shri Gurbunder Singh Gill was so appointed on 9.2.1997 whereas the agreement for sale was executed on 31.5.1994.	None
The petitioner has not controverted the averments contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the reply affidavit filed in Review Petition No.239/2011, perusal of which makes it clear that in 1993 similar parcels of land had been sold at the rate of Rs.15,73,289/ and Rs.13,74,345/ per acre.	None
Therefore, it cannot be said that M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. had paid exorbitantly high price to M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt.	None
Ltd. for extraneous reasons and we do not find any valid ground for indirect review of order dated 13.1.2011.	None
At this stage it will be apposite to observe that the power of review is a creature of the statute and no Court or quasijudicial body or administrative authority can review its judgment or order or decision unless it is legally empowered to do so.	None
Article 137 empowers this Court to review its judgments subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament or any rules made under Article 145 of the Constitution.	None
The Rules framed by this Court under that Article lay down that in civil cases, review lies on any of the grounds specified in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 which reads as under Order 47, Rule 11.	None
Application for review of judgment.(1)	None
Any person considering himself aggrieved(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred,(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or(c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the court which passed the decree or made the order.(2) A party who is not appealing from a decree or order may apply for a review of judgment notwithstanding the pendency of an appeal by some other party except where the ground of such appeal is common to the applicant and the appellant, or when, being respondent, he can present to the Appellate Court the case of which he applies for the review.	None
Explanation The fact that the decision on a question of law on which the judgment of the Court is based has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of a superior Court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review of such judgment.	None
The aforesaid provisions have been interpreted in several cases.	None
We shall notice some of them.	None
In S. Nagaraj v. State of Karnataka 1993 Supp (4) SCC 595, this Court referred to the judgments in Raja Prithwi Chand Lal Choudhury v. Sukhraj Rai AIR 1941 FC 1 and Rajunder Narain Rae v. Bijai Govind Singh (1836)	None
1 Moo PC 117 and observed Review literally and even judicially means reexamination or re consideration.	None
Basic philosophy inherent in it is the universal acceptance of human fallibility.	None
Yet in the realm of law the courts and even the statutes lean strongly in favour of finality of decision legally and properly made.	None
Exceptions both statutorily and judicially have been carved out to correct accidental mistakes or miscarriage of justice.	None
Even when there was no statutory provision and no rules were framed by the highest court indicating the circumstances in which it could rectify its order the courts culled out such power to avoid abuse of process or miscarriage of justice.	None
In Raja Prithwi Chand Lal Choudhury v. Sukhraj Rai the Court observed that even though no rules had been framed permitting the highest Court to review its order yet it was available on the limited and narrow ground developed by the Privy Council and the House of Lords.	None
The Court approved the principle laid down by the Privy Council in Rajunder Narain Rae v. Bijai Govind Singh that an order made by the Court was final and could not be altered nevertheless, if by misprision in embodying the judgments, by errors have been introduced, these Courts possess, by Common law, the same power which the Courts of record and statute have of rectifying the mistakes which have crept in The House of Lords exercises a similar power of rectifying mistakes made in drawing up its own judgments, and this Court must possess the same authority.	None
The Lords have however gone a step further, and have corrected mistakes introduced through inadvertence in the details of judgments or have supplied manifest defects in order to enable the decrees to be enforced, or have added explanatory matter, or have reconciled inconsistencies.	None
Basis for exercise of the power was stated in the same decision as underIt is impossible to doubt that the indulgence extended in such cases is mainly owing to the natural desire prevailing to prevent irremediable injustice being done by a Court of last resort, where by some accident, without any blame, the party has not been heard and an order has been inadvertently made as if the party had been heard.	None
Rectification of an order thus stems from the fundamental principle that justice is above all.	None
It is exercised to remove the error and not for disturbing finality.	None
When the Constitution was framed the substantive power to rectify or recall the order passed by this Court was specifically provided by Article 137 of the Constitution.	None
Our Constitutionmakers who had the practical wisdom to visualise the efficacy of such provision expressly conferred the substantive power to review any judgment or order by Article 137 of the Constitution.	None
And clause (c) of Article 145 permitted this Court to frame rules as to the conditions subject to which any judgment or order may be reviewed.	None
In exercise of this power Order XL had been framed empowering this Court to review an order in civil proceedings on grounds analogous to Order XLVII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code.	None
The expression, for any other sufficient reason in the clause has been given an expanded meaning and a decree or order passed under misapprehension of true state of circumstances has been held to be sufficient ground to exercise the power.	None
Apart from Order XL Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules this Court has the inherent power to make such orders as may be necessary in the interest of justice or to prevent the abuse of process of Court.	None
The Court is thus not precluded from recalling or reviewing its own order if it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so for sake of justice.	None
In Moran Mar Basselios Catholicos v. Most Rev. Mar Poulose Athanasius AIR 1954 SC 526 , the threeJudge Bench referred to the provisions of the Travancore Code of Civil Procedure, which was similar to Order 47 Rule 1 CPC and observed It is needless to emphasise that the scope of an application for review is much more restricted than that of an appeal.	None
Under the provisions in the Travancore Code of Civil Procedure which is similar in terms to Order 47 Rule 1 of our Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the court of review has only a limited jurisdiction circumscribed by the definitive limits fixed by the language used therein.	None
It may allow a review on three specified grounds, namely, (i) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the applicants knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed, (ii) mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, and (iii) for any other sufficient reason.	None
It has been held by the Judicial Committee that the words any other sufficient reason must mean a reason sufficient on grounds, at least analogous to those specified in the rule.	None
See Chhajju Ram v. Neki AIR 1922 PC 12 (D).	None
This conclusion was reiterated by the Judicial Committee in Bisheshwar Pratap Sahi v. Parath Nath AIR 1934 PC 213 (E) and was adopted by on Federal Court in Hari Shankar Pal v.	None
Anath Nath Mitter AIR 1949 FC 106 at pp.	None
110, 111 (F).	None
Learned counsel appearing in support of this appeal recognises the aforesaid limitations and submits that his case comes within the ground of mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or some ground analogous thereto.	None
In Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Govt.	None
of A.P. (1964)	None
5 SCR 174 , another threeJudge Bench reiterated that the power of review is not analogous to the appellate power and observed A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but lies only for patent error.	None
We do not consider that this furnishes a suitable occasion for dealing with this difference exhaustively or in any great detail, but it would suffice for us to say that where without any elaborate argument one could point to the error and say here is a substantial point of law which stares one in the face, and there could reasonably be no two opinions, entertained about it, a clear case of error apparent on the face of the record would be made out.	None
In Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aibam Pishak Sharma (1979) 4 SCC 389 , this Court answered in affirmative the question whether the High Court can review an order passed under Article 226 of the Constitution and proceeded to observe But, there are definitive limits to the exercise of the power of review.	None
The power of review may be exercised on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record is found it may also be exercised on any analogous ground.	None
But, it may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.	None
That would be the province of a court of appeal.	None
A power of review is not to be confused with appellate powers which may enable an appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court.	None
In Meera Bhanja v. Nirmala Kumari Choudhury (1995) 1 SCC 170 , the Court considered as to what can be characterised as an error apparent on the fact of the record and observed .it has to be kept in view that an error apparent on the face of record must be such an error which must strike one on mere looking at the record and would not require any longdrawn process of reasoning on points where there may conceivably be two opinions.	None
We may usefully refer to the observations of this Court in the case of Satyanarayan Laxminarayan Hegde v. Mallikarjun Bhavanappa Tirumale AIR 1960 SC 137 wherein, K.C. Das Gupta, J., speaking for the Court has made the following observations in connection with an error apparent on the face of the recordAn error which has to be established by a longdrawn process of reasoning on points where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record.	None
Where an alleged error is far from selfevident and if it can be established, it has to be established, by lengthy and complicated arguments, such an error cannot be cured by a writ of certiorari according to the rule governing the powers of the superior court to issue such a writ.	None
In Parsion Devi v. Sumitri Devi (1997) 8 SCC 715 , the Court observed An error which is not selfevident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the Court to exercise its power of review under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC A review petition, it must be remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an appeal in disguise.	None
In Lily Thomas v. Union of India (2000) 6 SCC 224 , R.P. Sethi, J., who concurred with S. Saghir Ahmad, J., summarised the scope of the power of review in the following words Such powers can be exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the exercise of power.	None
The review cannot be treated like an appeal in disguise.	None
The mere possibility of two views on the subject is not a ground for review.	None
Once a review petition is dismissed no further petition of review can be entertained.	None
The rule of law of following the practice of the binding nature of the larger Benches and not taking different views by the Benches of coordinated jurisdiction of equal strength has to be followed and practised.	None
In Haridas Das v. Usha Rani Banik (2006) 4 SCC 78 , the Court observed The parameters are prescribed in Order 47 CPC and for the purposes of this lis, permit the defendant to press for a rehearing on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the records or for any other sufficient reason.	None
The former part of the rule deals with a situation attributable to the applicant, and the latter to a jural action which is manifestly incorrect or on which two conclusions are not possible.	None
Neither of them postulate a rehearing of the dispute because a party had not highlighted all the aspects of the case or could perhaps have argued them more forcefully and or cited binding precedents to the court and thereby enjoyed a favourable verdict.	None
In State of West Bengal v. Kamal Sengupta (2008) 8 SCC 612 , the Court considered the question whether a Tribunal established under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 can review its decision, referred to Section 22(3) of that Act, some of the judicial precedents and observed At this stage it is apposite to observe that where a review is sought on the ground of discovery of new matter or evidence, such matter or evidence must be relevant and must be of such a character that if the same had been produced, it might have altered the judgment.	None
In other words, mere discovery of new or important matter or evidence is not sufficient ground for review ex debito justitiae.	None
Not only this, the party seeking review has also to show that such additional matter or evidence was not within its knowledge and even after the exercise of due diligence, the same could not be produced before the court earlier.	None
The term mistake or error apparent by its very connotation signifies an error which is evident per se from the record of the case and does not require detailed examination, scrutiny and elucidation either of the facts or the legal position.	None
If an error is not selfevident and detection thereof requires long debate and process of reasoning, it cannot be treated as an error apparent on the face of the record for the purpose of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC or Section 22(3)(f) of the Act.	None
To put it differently an order or decision or judgment cannot be corrected merely because it is erroneous in law or on the ground that a different view could have been taken by the court tribunal on a point of fact or law.	None
In any case, while exercising the power of review, the court tribunal concerned cannot sit in appeal over its judgment decision.	None
In the light of the propositions laid down in the aforementioned judgments, we shall now examine whether the petitioner has succeeded in making out a case for exercise of power by this Court under Article 137 of the Constitution read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Issue
This consideration needs to be prefaced with an observation that the petitioner has not offered any explanation as to why it did not lead any evidence before the Reference Court to show that sale deed Exhibit P1 was not a bona fide transaction and the vendee had paid unusually high price for extraneous reasons.	Reasoning
The parties had produced several sale deeds, majority of which revealed that the price of similar parcels of land varied from Rs. 6 to 7 lakhs per acre.	Reasoning
A reading of the sale deeds would have prompted any person of ordinary prudence to make an enquiry as to	Reasoning
why M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. (vendee) had paid more than Rs.2,42,00,000/ for 12 acres land, which have been purchased by the vendor only a year back at an average price of Rs.6 lakhs per acre.	Reasoning
However, the fact of the matter is that neither the advocate for the petitioner nor its officers officials, who were dealing with the cases made any attempt to lead such evidence.	Reasoning
This may be because they were aware of the fact that at least in two other cases such parcels of land had been sold in 1993 for more than Rs.13 lakhs and Rs.15 lakhs per acre and in 1996, a sale deed was executed in respect of the land of village Naharpur Kasan at the rate of Rs.25 lakhs per acre.	Reasoning
This omission coupled with the fact that the petitioners assertion about commonality of the management of two companies is exfacie incorrect leads to an irresistible inference that judgment dated 17.8.2010 does not suffer from any error apparent on the face of the record warranting its review.	Reasoning
Surely, in guise of seeking review, the petitioner cannot ask for de novo hearing of the appeals.20.	Reasoning
The petitioners plea that the documents produced along with the review petitions could not be brought to the notice of the Reference Court and the High Court despite exercise of due diligence by its officers does not commend acceptance because it had not explained as to why the concerned officers officials, who were very much aware of other sale transactions produced by themselves and the landowners did not try to find out the reasons for wide difference in the price of land sold by Exhibit P1 and other parcels of land sold by Exhibits P2 to P13 and Exhibits R1 to R15.21.	Reasoning
Before concluding, we would like to add that while deciding the review petitions, this Court cannot make roving inquiries into the validity of the transaction involving the sale of land by M s. Heritage Furniture Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd. to	Reasoning
M s. Duracell India Pvt. Ltd. or declare the same to be invalid by assuming that the vendee had paid higher price to take benefit of an anticipated joint venture agreement with a foreign company.	Reasoning
Of course, the petitioner has not controverted the statement made by the respondents that the vendee had sold the land to M s. Lattu Finance and Investments Ltd. in 2004 for a sum of Rs.13,62,00,000/ i.e. at the rate of Rs.1,13,00,000/ per acre.22.	Reasoning
In the result, the review petitions are dismissed.	Decision
The interim order passed on 30.3.2011 stands automatically vacated.	Decision
The petitioner shall pay cost of Rs.25,000/ in each case.	Decision
The amount of cost shall be deposited with the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee within a period of three months.23.	Decision
However, it is made clear that the petitioner shall be free to withdraw the amount which it had deposited in compliance of this Courts order dated 30.3.2011.	Decision
In any case, the petitioner shall pay the balance amount of compensation to the landowners and or their legal representatives along with other statutory benefits within three months from today.24.	Decision
In view of the dismissal of the review petitions and the direction given for payment of the balance amount, the contempt petitions and all the pending interlocutory applications are disposed of as infructuous.	Decision
