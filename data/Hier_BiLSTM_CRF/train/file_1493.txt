The Corporation should, therefore, immediately withdraw the scheme for allotment of residential plots and refund the application money of the applicants so that there are no legal complications.	Facts
Sd  About two months prior to consideration of the issue relating to disposal of surplus land by Plan Approval Committee of the Corporation, an advertisement was issued, which was published in The Tribune dated 20.10.2003 inviting applications for 280 residential plots in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, focal point, Mohali under the Industrial Housing Scheme.	Facts
In the application form issued by the Corporation, the following stipulation was incorporated The acceptance of application form and earnest money does not place the corporation under any obligation to allot you a plot.	Facts
About 3500 persons including those who filed writ petitions before the High Court applied for allotment of residential plots in Mohali.	Facts
After five months, another advertisement was issued on 23.3.2004 under the authority of the Managing Director of the CorporationcumChairman, Allotment Committee informing the applicants that draw of lots for allotment of residential plots in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali, focal point, Patiala and Phase VIII (Jeevan Nagar), Ludhiana will be held on 31.3.2004.	Facts

Facts
It is further clarified that any applicant found successful in the draw of lots and not agreeable to above conditions, may seek refund of their earnest money any time till the letter of allotment is issued by PSIEC.	Facts
(Emphasis supplied)11.	None
All the writ petitioners were declared successful in the draw and their names were placed in the provisional list of successful applicants.	Facts
However, allotment letters were issued only to those who had applied for plots in focal point, Patiala and Phase VIII (Jeevan Nagar), Ludhiana.	Facts
Some of the petitioners, who had applied for the plots in focal point, Mohali filed Writ Petition No.12396/2004 with the complaint that they have been arbitrarily discriminated in the matter of allotment of plots.	Facts
However, they withdrew the writ petition with liberty to challenge the stipulation contained in the advertisement that the acceptance of application form or earnest money will not place the Corporation under an obligation to allot a plot to the applicant.	Facts
Thereafter, a batch of writ petitions was filed questioning the legality of the stipulation contained in the application form, note incorporated in advertisement dated 23.3.2004 and the decision contained in Memo dated 5.8.2004.	Facts
The writ petitioners invoked the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation and pleaded that on being declared successful in the draw of lots, they have acquired a right to be allotted plots in focal point, Mohali and the Corporation is bound to fulfil the promise made by issuing advertisement dated 20.10.2003.	Facts
They pleaded that the State Government does not have the power to direct the Corporation to abandon the policy of allotting residential plots in the industrial focal points and the decision contained in Memo dated 5.8.2004 is vitiated due to mala fides because the same was designed to favour some individuals who wanted to utilize the land for commercial purpose by building multiplex complexes.	Facts
They further pleaded that the Corporations failure to issue allotment letters has resulted in discrimination and violation of their fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution.	Facts
In the written statements filed on behalf of the State Government and the Corporation, it was pleaded that the decision contained in Memo dated 5.8.2004 was in consonance with policy of the State Government to promote industrialization of the State, which was expected to give impetus to the economy of different areas and generate employment.	Facts
It was further pleaded that in its capacity as owner of the land, the State Government was entitled to take appropriate policy decision and the writ petitioners are not entitled to claim allotment of plots merely because they had applied pursuant to advertisement dated 20.10.2003 or their names were included in the provisional list of successful applicants.	Facts
The Corporation relied upon Article 90 of its Memorandum of Association and pleaded that the State Government is empowered to issue directions on policy matters and its refusal to sanction change of land use in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali falls within the ambit of Article 90.	Facts
According to the Corporation, advertisement dated 23.3.2004 was issued for holding draw of lots because the Governments decision on the proposal for change of land use from industrial to residential was getting delayed and it was felt that the earnest money deposited by those who may be ultimately unsuccessful should not be retained for a long time.	Facts
The parties filed further pleadings in the form of rejoinder and supplementary affidavits reiterating their respective stand.12.	Facts
After adverting to the pleadings of the parties and arguments of the learned Counsel, the Division Bench of the High Court framed the following questions Whether the holding of a draw of lots for allotment of residential plots confers a right on the petitioners for the allotment of the plots on the principle of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectations?(b) Whether in any case a concluded contract has come into existence between the parties and if so, whether the petitioners can enforce the same by way of writ petition?(c)	Facts
What is the power of the State Government to issue directive to the PSIEC in terms of Article 90 of the Memorandum of Association of the PSIEC and if so, what is its binding effect?	Facts
Besides, whether only the governor can issue such directive in his personal capacity and not the State Government?(d)	Facts
What is the scope of judicial review of the policy decision of the State Government whereby it has vide its impugned decision dated 5.8.2004 (Annexure P12), decided not to be desirable to change the land use from industrial to residential and whether such policy decision is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court?	Facts
The Division Bench of the High Court first considered whether the writ petitioners were entitled to invoke the doctrines of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel, referred to the judgments of this Court in Food Corporation of India v. M s. Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries, (1993) 1 SCC 71 Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corporation Ors., (1993) 1 SCC 499 National Building Construction Corporation v. S.

v. Union of India and Anr., (1995) 1 SCC 274 and held that even though the State Government and the Corporation, which is an instrumentality of the State, are expected to act fairly and reasonably in their dealing with the members of public, mere inviting of applications and draw of lots by the Corporation did not create a right in favour of the writ petitioners and they cannot invoke the doctrines of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel for compelling the Corporation to allot plots to them in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, focal point, Mohali because in the format of application, it was clearly mentioned that acceptance of the application form and earnest money will not place the Corporation under an obligation to allot plot to the applicant.14.	Facts
The Division Bench then referred to Article 90 of the Memorandum of Association of the Corporation, noticed the judgments of this Court in Rakesh Ranjan Verma and Ors.	Facts

State of Punjab decided on 14.5.2004 and Punjab Financial Corporation Employees Welfare Association v. Punjab Financial Corporation, ILR 2004 (II) 113 (P H) , and held the decision of the Government not to sanction change of land use from industrial to residential was in the nature of a direction which could be issued under Article 90 of the Memorandum of Association of the Corporation.15.	Facts
The Division Bench finally considered the question whether the policy decision contained in Memo dated 5.8.2004 is arbitrary, irrational and illogical or is vitiated due to malafides.	Facts
After noticing the broad parameters of judicial review of policy decisions, the Division Bench referred to minutes of the meeting of the Allotment Committee held on 5.2.2004, notings dated 9.6.2004 and 20.6.2004 recorded by Principal Secretary, Industries and Commerce that the possibility of using the land in a manner which may generate maximum revenue may be explored rather than choosing the easy way out of changing land use to residential and held that the apprehension expressed by learned Counsel for the petitioners that the policy has been changed only to accommodate M s. A.B. Motions (Pvt.)	Facts
Limited which was intending to set up multiplexes on the land in question is not entirely without basis.	Facts
The Division Bench opined that the recommendations made by the Allotment Committee on 5.2.2004 have direct bearing on the final decision taken and conveyed vide Memo dated 5.8.2004 and, therefore, the same is liable to be quashed.	Facts
Mr. P.S. Patwalia and Mr. C.A. Sundaram, Senior Advocates and other learned Counsel appearing for the writ petitionersappellants extensively referred to the pleadings of the parties and documents produced by them and argued that the High Court committed an error by declining to invoke the doctrine of legitimate expectation despite the fact that the policy decision contained in Memo dated 26.12.2001 for earmarking 2030 area for Industrial Housing was acted upon more than once by carving out residential plots in different focal points and allotting the same to the successful applicants.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel relied upon the ratio of judgments in Food Corporation of India v. M s. Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries (supra) and Union of India v. Hindustan Development Corporation and Ors.	Arguments of Petitioner
(supra) and argued that refusal of the State Government to approve utilization of some portions of land in focal point, Mohali for carving out residential pockets was wholly arbitrary and the Division Bench was not at all justified in declining relief to the writ petitioners only on the ground that at the time of submitting applications, they knew that the Corporation will not be obliged to allot plots to the successful applicants and that draw of lots was held with a clear indication that the same would be provisional.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior Counsel emphasized that residential pockets were carved out by the Corporation in focal point, Mohali in consonance with the policy contained in Memo dated 26.12.2001 and when the Division Bench held that the decision contained in Memo dated 5.8.2004 is vitiated due to mala fides, a direction ought to have been given for allotment of residential plots to the successful applicants.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel further argued that even though the draw held in furtherance of advertisement dated 23.3.2004 was provisional, after having treated the same as final and allotted residential plots to those who had applied for plots in focal points at Patiala and Ludhiana, the Corporation cannot refuse to fulfil its promise of allotting plots to those who had applied for the plots in focal point, Mohali.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel appearing for the State and the Corporation argued that the writ petitioners are not entitled to invoke the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation because at the time of submitting applications, they were very much aware of the stipulation contained in the format of application that the Corporation will not be obliged to allot plots to them and this was made more explicit by incorporating a note in advertisement dated 23.3.2004 that the draw of lots will be provisional and the same would not confer any right upon the successful applicants to claim allotment of plot or interest on the earnest money.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Counsel submitted that inclusion of the writ petitioners name in the provisional list of the successful applicants did not confer a right upon them to seek allotment of plots because the decision of Plan Approval Committee of the Corporation to approve the layouts of residential pockets in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali was subject to sanction of change of land use and the Allotment Committee had categorically opined that no allotment may be made by the Corporation for housing purposes.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Counsel then submitted that the State Governments decision to approve the Corporations proposal for earmarking 2030 land for Industrial Housing did not result in change of the land use which continued to be industrial and the Corporation had no right to suo motu change the land use from industrial to residential.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Counsel submitted that any change of land use is required to be approved by the competent authority constituted under the 1995 Act and the State Government rightly declined to approve change of land use from industrial to residential because the same would have seriously undermined the object of industrialization of different parts of the State.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Counsel assailed the quashing of the decision contained in Memo dated 5.8.2004 by arguing that the Division Bench committed serious error in declaring that the said decision is vitiated due to mala fides merely because the Allotment Committee had considered the possibility of utilizing land in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali for commercial purposes including construction of multiplexes.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Counsel laid considerable emphasis on the fact that the State Government had not accepted the recommendations made by the Plan Approval Committee of the Corporation or the Allotment Committee and submitted that this, by itself, was indicative of the fact that ultimate decision of the Government was not influenced by any extraneous consideration.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Counsel lastly argued that the Corporation cannot, on its own, allot land in any focal point for a purpose other than industrial and, in any case, land use cannot be changed from industrial to residential without complying with the relevant provisions of the 1995 Act.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the respective arguments submissions and scrutinized the records.	Issue
We shall first consider whether the State Governments refusal to sanction change of land use from industrial to residential is vitiated due to mala fides or arbitrary exercise of power.	Issue
The Division Bench of the High Court answered this question in negative by relying upon notings dated 9.6.2004 and 20.6.2004 recorded by Principal Secretary, Industries and Commerce, minutes of the meeting of Allotment Committee held on 5.2.2004 wherein a conditional decision was taken to allot 46 Acres of land at Mohali to M s. Quark and proposal for allotment of 4050 Acres of land to M s. A.B. Motions (Pvt.)	None
Limited was considered.	None
In the opinion of the Division Bench, refusal of the Government to sanction change of land use had close link nexus with the decision taken and or recommendations made by the Allotment Committee, which gave an impression that the State Government wanted to favour those who were intending to set up multiplex complexes.	None
In our view, the aforesaid conclusion of the Division Bench of the High Court is not based on correct appreciation of the factual matrix and the background in which the Government declined to sanction change of land use from industrial to residential.	Reasoning
It is not in dispute that the State Government acquired land and handed over the same to the Corporation which, as mentioned above, was created for developing infrastructure necessary for industrialization of different areas of the State.	Reasoning
The land placed at the disposal of the Corporation was meant to be used for industrial purposes.	Reasoning
After carrying out necessary development, the Corporation allotted land to those interested in setting up industrial units.	Reasoning
In December 2001, the State Government approved the proposal of the Corporation for earmarking 2030 of the land for Industrial Housing in the existing and coming up focal points and growth centres developed by the Corporation.	Reasoning
The object underlying this policy decision was to provide some land for residential purpose to those who had set up or were intending to set up industrial units and the workers already employed or to be employed in such units.	Reasoning
It was felt that the availability of residential facility within the focal point or growth centre will help in accelerating industrialization of the area.	Reasoning
This is the reason why the phrase Industrial Housing was used in contrast to the term residential in Memo dated 26.10.2001.	None
This is also the reason why Plan Approval Committee of the Corporation had, while approving layouts of residential pockets in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB had made it subject to approval of change of land use under the 1995 Act.	None
In its meeting held on 5.2.2004, the Allotment Committee did recommend amendments in Industrial Policy, 2003 to facilitate development of industrial parks estates agroparks I.T. parks and multiplex complexes, but unequivocally opposed the idea of allotment of land for housing purposes.	None
The issue was then considered by the State Government and an unequivocal decision was taken not to allow change of land use from industrial to residential.	Reasoning
The record produced before the High Court and the documents produced before this Court do not show that the State Government had sanctioned change of land use in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali from industrial to commercial and allowed setting up of multiplex complexes within the focal points or growth centres.	Reasoning
The writ petitioners have also not placed any material before this Court to show that the State Government had approved conditional allotment of land to M s. Quark by the Allotment Committee or accepted the tentative recommendation made by it for allotment of land to M s. A.B. Motion (Pvt.)	Reasoning
Ltd.	Reasoning
Rather, the events which followed the State Governments refusal to sanction change of land use from industrial to residential demonstrate that the said decision was in consonance with the policy of industrialization which was unquestionably in public interest.	Reasoning
In August 2004, the Corporation issued an advertisement which was published in The Tribune dated 13.8.2004, inviting applications for 65 industrial plots.	Reasoning
In its meeting held on 13.12.2005, the Allotment Committee decided to allot 39.3 acres land in Phase VIIIA, focal point, Mohali to M s. Wipro Limited for setting up its unit of Software and I.T. Enabled Services because the same was expected to attract investment of Rs. 1,336 crores and generate employment opportunities for more than 9000 people.	Reasoning
The Committee also decided to allot 25 acres land to M s. Tata Consultancy Services for setting up their Software Development Centre by making an investment of Rs.25 crores with an employment potential of 575 persons.	Reasoning
The High Court appears to have been unduly influenced by the fact that the Allotment Committee had considered a proposal for allotment of land to M s. A.B. Motions (Pvt.)	Reasoning
Ltd	Reasoning
However, in the absence of any tangible or substantive evidence to show that the State Government had taken a conscious decision to allot the surplus land in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali for construction of multiplex complexes or for any purpose other than industrial, the Division Bench of the High Court was not at all justified in recording a finding that the decision contained in Memo dated 5.8.2004 is vitiated due to mala fides.	Reasoning
It is trite to say that while exercising power of judicial review, the superior Courts should not readily accept the charge of malus animus laid against the State and its functionaries.	None
The burden to prove the charge of mala fides is always on the person who moves the Court for invalidation of the action of the State and or its agencies and instrumentalities on the ground that the same is vitiated due to mala fides and the Courts should resist the temptation of drawing dubious inferences of mala fides or bad faith on the basis of vague and bald allegations or inchoate pleadings.	None
In such cases, wisdom would demand that the Court should insist upon furnishing of some tangible evidence by the petitioner in support of his her allegations.	None
It must always be remembered that in a democratic polity like ours, the functions of the Government are carried out by different individuals at different levels.	None
The issues and policy matters which are required to be decided by the Government are dealt with by several functionaries some of whom may record notings on the files favouring a particular person or group of persons.	None
Someone may suggest a particular line of action, which may not be conducive to public interest and others may suggest adoption of a different mode in larger public interest.	None
However, the final decision is required to be taken by the designated authority keeping in view the larger public interest.	None
The notings recorded in the files cannot be made basis for recording a finding that the ultimate decision taken by the Government is tainted by mala fides or is influenced by extraneous considerations.	None
The Court is duty bound to carefully take note of the same.	None
In this context, reference can usefully be made to the decision of the Constitution Bench in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu, (1974) 4 SCC 3.	None
In that case, the petitioner, who was, at one time holding the post of Chief Secretary of the State, questioned the decision of the Government to post him as an OfficeronSpecial Duty.	None
One of the grounds on which he attacked the decision of the Government was that the Chief Minister of the State, Shri K. Karunanidhi was illdisposed against him.	None
While dealing with the question whether the transfer and posting of the petitioner was vitiated due to mala fides, Bhagwati, J. speaking for self and Y.V. Chandrachud and V.R. Krishna Iyer, JJ., observed Now, when we examine this contention we must bear in mind two important considerations.	None
In the first place, we must make it clear, despite a very strenuous argument to the contrary, that we are not called upon to investigate into acts of maladministration by the political Government headed by the second respondent.	None
It is not within our province to embark on a farflung inquiry into acts of Commission and omission charged against the second respondent in the administration of the affairs of Tamil Nadu.	None
That is not the scope of the inquiry before us and we must decline to enter upon any such inquiry.	None
It is one thing to say that the second respondent was guilty of misrule and another to say that he had malus animus against the petitioner which was the operative cause of the displacement of the petitioner from the post of Chief Secretary.	None
We are concerned only with the latter limited issue, not with the former popular issue.	None
We cannot permit the petitioner to side track the issue and escape the burden of establishing hostility and malus animus on the part of the second respondent by diverting our attention to incidents of suspicious exercise of executive power.	None
That would be nothing short of drawing a red herring across the trail.	None
The only question before us is whether the action taken by the respondents includes any component of mala fides whether hostility and malus animus against the petitioner were the operational cause of the transfer of the petitioner from the post of Chief Secretary.	None
Secondly, we must not also overlook that the burden of establishing mala fides is very heavy on the person who alleges it.	None
The allegations of mala fides are often more easily made than proved, and the very seriousness of such allegations demands proof of a high order of credibility.	None
Here the petitioner, who was himself once the Chief Secretary, has flung a series of charges of oblique conduct against the Chief Minister.	None
That is in itself a rather extraordinary and unusual occurrence and if these charges are true, they are bound to shake the confidence of the people in the political custodians of power in the State, and therefore, the anxiety of the Court should be all the greater to insist on a high degree of proof.	None
In this context it may be noted that top administrators are often required to do acts which affect others adversely but which are necessary in the execution of their duties.	None
These acts may lend themselves to misconstruction and suspicion as to the bona fides of their author when the full facts and surrounding circumstances are not known.	None
The Court would, therefore, be slow to draw dubious inferences from incomplete facts placed before it by a party, particularly when the imputations are grave and they are made against the holder of an office which has a high responsibility in the administration.	None
Such is the judicial perspective in evaluating charge of unworthy conduct against ministers and other high authorities, not because of any special status which they are supposed to enjoy, nor because they are highly placed in social life or administrative set upthese considerations are wholly irrelevant in judicial approachbut because otherwise, functioning effectively would become difficult in a democracy.	None
(Emphasis supplied)	None
The issue deserves to be considered from another angle.	Reasoning
Section 79 of the 1995 Act, the applicability of which to the case in hand has not been questioned by the writ petitionerappellants, mandates that after coming into operation of any Master Plan in any area, no person shall use or permit to be used any land or carry out development in that area otherwise than in conformity with such Master Plan.	Reasoning
Proviso to this section empowers the competent authority to allow continuance of any use of any land for a maximum period of 10 years for the purpose for which it was being used on the date of enforcement of the Master Plan.	Reasoning
Section 81 of that Act lays down the procedure for change of land use.	Reasoning
In terms of Subsection (2) of Section 81, even a department of the State Government or the Central Government or a local authority is required to notify to the competent authority of its intention to carry out any development in respect of any land or change of use.	Reasoning
The competent authority can object to such development or change of land use.	Reasoning
In that event, the matter is required to be considered and decided by the State Government.	Reasoning
In view of these provisions, the State Government was well within its power to take appropriate decision on the proposal made by the Corporation to change the land use from industrial to residential and we do not find any fault with its decision not to sanction such change.	Reasoning
We shall now deal with the question whether the writ petitioners are entitled to allotment of residential plots in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali.	Issue
As noted herein above, the writ petitioners had invoked the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation and urged that even though the application form contained a stipulation that acceptance of application and earnest money will not put the Corporation under an obligation to allot a plot to the applicant, they were reasonably sure of getting residential plots because in 2002 the Corporation had undertaken a similar exercise and allotted 138 freehold plots in focal point, Mohali by inviting applications and holding draw of lots.	Facts
We are in complete agreement with the Division Bench of the High Court that no promise much less an enforceable promise was made by the Corporation to the prospective applicants that by making an application pursuant to the advertisement and on being declared successful in the draw of lots, they will get residential plots.	Reasoning
Rather, being conscious of the fact that in terms of the approval accorded by the State Government vide Memo dated 26.12.2001, it could utilize 2030 area of the focal point only for Industrial Housing, the Corporation had made it clear to the prospective applicants that there is no certainty of their getting residential plots in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali.	Reasoning
The decision taken by Plan Approval Committee of the Corporation to approve the layouts of residential pockets in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali was not final.	Reasoning
The same was subject to sanction of change of land use in accordance with the provisions of the 1995 Act.	Reasoning
The Allotment Committee made a clear recommendation against utilization of surplus land for housing purposes.	Reasoning
The writ petitioners were very much aware of the tentative character of the initial advertisement as also the advertisement issued for holding draw of lots.	Reasoning
By incorporating note in the second advertisement, which has been reproduced herein above, the Corporation had made it known to every one that the entire exercise was provisional and those who did not want to participate in that exercise were at liberty to seek refund of the earnest money.	Reasoning
To put it differently, the Corporation did not make any representation to the prospective applicants which induced them to part with their money or adversely change their position.	Reasoning
Therefore, the High Court rightly refused to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel in favour of the writ petitioners.	Reasoning
In Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P., (1979) 2 SCC 409 , a twoJudge Bench of this Court discussed the doctrine of promissory estoppel in great detail and laid down the various propositions including the following The true principle of promissory estoppel, therefore, seems to be that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise in the future, knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise is made and it is in fact so acted upon by the other party, the promise would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it, if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties, and this would be so irrespective of whether there is any preexisting relationship between the parties or not.	None
extracts from paragraph 8 The law may, therefore, now be taken to be settled as a result of this decision, that where the Government makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promisee and, in fact, the promisee, acting in reliance on it, alters his position, the Government would be held bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the Government at the instance of the promisee, notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article 299 of the Constitution.	None
extracts from paragraph 15 A contrary view was expressed by another twoJudge Bench in Jit Ram v. State of Haryana, (1981) 1 SCC 11 , but the law laid down in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P. (supra) was reiterated in Union of India v. Godfrey Philips India Ltd., (1985) 4 SCC 369 , which was decided by a threeJudge Bench.	None
Bhagwati, C.J. with whom the other two members of the Bench agreed on the exposition of law relating to the doctrine of promissory estoppel, observed Of course we must make it clear, and that is also laid down in Motilal Sugar Mills case that there can be no promissory estoppel against the Legislature in the exercise of its legislative functions nor can the Government or public authority be debarred by promissory estoppel from enforcing a statutory prohibition.	None
It is equally true that promissory estoppel cannot be used to compel the Government or a public authority to carry out a representation or promise which is contrary to law or which was outside the authority or, power of the officer of the Government or of the public authority to make.	None
We may also point out that the doctrine of promissory estoppel being an equitable doctrine, it must yield when the equity so requires if it can be shown by the Government or public authority that having regard to the facts as they have transpired, it would be inequitable to hold the Government or public authority to the promise or representation made by it, the Court would not raise an equity in favour of the person to whom the promise or representation is made and enforce the promise or representation against the Government or public authority.	None
The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case, because on the facts, equity would not require that the Government or public authority should be held bound by the promise or representation made by it.	None
This aspect has been dealt with fully in Motilal Sugar Mills case and we find ourselves wholly in agreement with what has been said in that decision on this point.	None
In Hira Tikoo v. Union Territory, Chandigarh, III (2004) SLT 850(2004) 6 SCC 765 , this Court considered whether the High Court was justified in refusing to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel for issuing a mandamus to the respondentChandigarh Administration to allot industrial plots to the petitioners, who had applied in response to an advertisement issued in 1981.	None
The Court noted that some of the successful applicants were given possession of the plots but majority of them were not given allotment letters on the ground that the land formed part of the reserved forest and partially approved the decision of the High Court by making the following observations Surely, the doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied against public authorities when their mistaken advice or representation is found to be in breach of a statute and therefore, against general public interest.	None
The question, however, is whether the parties or individuals, who had suffered because of the mistake and negligence on the part of the statutory public authorities, would have any remedy of redressal for the loss they have suffered.	None
The rules of fairness by which every public authority is bound, require them to compensate loss occasioned to private parties or citizens who were misled in acting on such mistaken or negligent advice of the public authority.	None
There are no allegations and material in these cases to come to a conclusion that the action of the authorities was mala fide.	None
It may be held to be careless or negligent.	None
In some of the English cases, the view taken is that the public authorities cannot be absolved of their liability to provide adequate monetary compensation to the parties who are adversely affected by their erroneous decisions and actions.	None
But in these cases, any directions to the public authorities to pay monetary compensation or damages would also indirectly harm general public interest.	None
The public authorities are entrusted with public fund raised from public money.	None
The funds are in trust with them for utilisation in public interest and strictly for the purposes of the statute under which they are created with specific statutory duties imposed on them.	None
In such a situation when a party or citizen has relied, to his detriment, on an erroneous representation made by public authorities and suffered loss and where the doctrine of estoppel will not be invoked to his aid, directing administrative redressal would be a more appropriate remedy than payment of monetary compensation for the loss caused by nondelivery of the possession of the plots and consequent delay caused in setting up industries by the allottees.	None
The plea of the writ petitioners that they had legitimate expectation of being allotted residential plots in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB in Mohali because in 2002 138 plots were allotted to the successful applicants sans merit.	Reasoning
At the cost of repetition, it is necessary to mention that the writ petitioners had submitted applications knowing fully well that the same would not obligate the Corporation to allot plots to them.	Reasoning
It is rather intriguing that even though approval of the layouts of residential pockets in Phases VIIIA and VIIIB, Mohali by Plan Approval Committee of the Corporation was subject to approval being accorded by the competent authority under the 1995 Act for change of land use from industrial to residential, and the Allotment Committee in which Managing Director of the Corporation had taken part, made a negative recommendation in the matter of allotment of land for housing purposes, the same officer authorized issue of advertisement dated 23.3.2004 for holding provisional draw of lots.	Reasoning
In our view, this exercise was wholly unnecessary and uncalled for.	Reasoning
If the concerned officer had not acted in haste and waited for the decision of the competent authority on the issue of change of land use, the parties may not have been forced to fight this unwarranted litigation.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, the writ petitioners cannot, by any stretch of imagination, claim that they had a legitimate expectation in the matter of allotment of plots despite the fact that change of land use was yet to be sanctioned.	Reasoning
The doctrine of legitimate expectation has been described in Halsburys Laws of England, 4th Edn.	None
in the following words A person may have a legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment.	None
The expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority, including an implied representation, or from consistent past practice.	None
In Food Corporation of India v. Kamdhenu Cattle Feed Industries (supra), this Court considered whether by submitting tender in response to notice issued by the Food Corporation of India for sale of stocks of damaged food grains, the respondent had acquired a right to have its tender accepted and the appellant was not entitled to reject the same.	None
While approving the view expressed by the High Court that rejection of the highest tender of the writ petitionerrespondent was legally correct, this Court observed The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of nonarbitrariness, a necessary concomitant of the rule of law.	None
Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decisionmaking process.	None
Whether the expectation of the claimant is reasonable or legitimate in the context is a question of fact in each case.	None
Whenever the question arises, it is to be determined not according to the claimants perception but in larger public interest wherein other more important considerations may outweigh what would otherwise have been the legitimate expectation of the claimant.	None
A bona fide decision of the public authority reached in this manner would satisfy the requirement of nonarbitrariness and withstand judicial scrutiny.	None
The doctrine of legitimate expectation gets assimilated in the rule of law and operates in our legal system in this manner and to this extent.	None
In Union of India v.Hindustan Development Corporation (supra), the doctrine of legitimate expectation was explained in the following words .	None
For legal purposes, the expectation cannot be the same as anticipation.	None
It is different from a wish, a desire or a hope nor can it amount to a claim or demand on the ground of a right.	None
However earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a hope may be and however confidently one may look to them to be fulfilled, they by themselves cannot amount to an assertable expectation and a mere disappointment does not attract legal consequences.	None
A pious hope even leading to a moral obligation cannot amount to a legitimate expectation.	None
The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure followed in regular and natural sequence.	None
Again it is distinguishable from a genuine expectation.	None
Such expectation should be justifiably legitimate and protectable.	None
Every such legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify into a right and therefore it does not amount to a right in the conventional sense.	None
The same principle has been stated and reiterated in Punjab Communications Ltd. v. Union of India, V (1999)	None

SLT 457(2009) 1 SCC 180.	None
In the last mentioned judgment, the Court referred to various precedents and observed the golden thread running through all these decisions is that a case for applicability of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, now accepted in the subjective sense as part of our legal jurisprudence, arises when an administrative body by reason of a representation or by past practice or conduct aroused an expectation which it would be within its powers to fulfil unless some overriding public interest comes in the way.	None
However, a person who bases his claim on the doctrine of legitimate expectation, in the first instance, has to satisfy that he has relied on the said representation and the denial of that expectation has worked to his detriment.	None
The Court could interfere only if the decision taken by the authority was found to be arbitrary, unreasonable or in gross abuse of power or in violation of principles of natural justice and not taken in public interest.	None
But a claim based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a right to invoke these principles.	None
The plea of discrimination raised by the appellants is being mentioned only to be rejected because no similarity has been pointed out between their cases and the cases of those who had applied for allotment of plots in focal point, Patiala and Phase VIII (Jeevan Nagar), Ludhiana except that a common draw was held in furtherance of advertisement dated 23.3.2004.	Reasoning
In any case, in view of our interpretation of the policy decision contained in Memo dated 26.12.2001, the allotment made in two other focal points, cannot enure to the appellants advantage and a mandamus cannot be issued in their favour because that would result in compelling the competent authority to sanction change of land use from industrial to residential in contravention of the policy decision taken by the State Government.33.	Reasoning
In the result, the appeals arising out SLP(C) Nos.1969/2006, 2786/2006, 3874/2006, 4761/2006, 15967/2006 and 13609/2007 are dismissed and the one arising out of SLP (C) No.14133/2006 filed by the State of Punjab is allowed.	Decision
Consequently, all the writ petitions filed before the High Court shall stand dismissed.	Decision
The parties are left to bear their own costs.	Decision
