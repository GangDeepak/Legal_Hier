 GOSWAMI, J.1.	None
This is an appeal by special leave against the Judgment of the Gujarat High Court dated 8th/9th December, 1970.2.	None
The respondent (hereinafter to be described as the assessee) entered into a contract with the Public Works Department of the Government of Gujarat on September 6, 1965 for manufacture and sup ply of kilnburnt bricks to the said Department for the construction of the Capital Project, Ghandhinagar.	Facts
Large quantities of bricks were manufactured and supplied under the contract and the applicant received payment for the same in accordance with the agreed rates.	Facts
The assessee made an application under section 52 of the Bombay Sales lax Act, 1959, on November 19, 1967, to the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, to determine the question whether the said supplies of bricks by the ass essee to the Public Works Department were sales or works contract.	Facts
The Deputy Commissioner held the supplied of bricks by the assessee as sales.	Facts
The assessee then appealed to the Tribunal against that order.	Facts
The Tribunal following the ratio of the decision of this Court in Chandra Bhan Gosain v. The State of Orissa and others (14 S.T.C. 766 119641 2 S.C.R. 879.) came to the conclusion that the supplies of bricks were sales.	Facts
At the instance of the assessee, the Tribunal referred the following question of law to t he High CourtWhether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the transaction envisaged by the contract entered into by the applicant with the Public Works Department of the Government of Gujarat on 6th September 1965 for the manufacture and supply of kilnburnt bricks to the said Department and the supply of bricks to the said Department in terms of their running B ill No. XI dated 28th October 1967 is a sale or a works contract ?	Facts
The High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee holding that the transaction was a works contract.	None
In coming to that conclusion the High Court hold as followsIn our opinion the decision of the Supreme Court in Chandra Bhan Gosais case (supra) is clearly distinguishable on facts.	Facts
The contract in that case though prima facie word cd as regards the relevant clauses i n similar fashion as the contract in the instant case is in fact cast in a different mould and it would be difficult to hold in the light of the special features and characteristics of the contract with which we are concerned that the decision of the Supreme Court in that case would completely govern the facts of this case.	Facts
3.	None
Mr. S. T. Desai, the learned counsel for the appellant submits that the present case is squarely governed by the decision in Chandra Bhan Gosains case (supra) and the High Court is wrong in holding to the contrary.4.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. V. S. Desai learned counsel appearing on behalf of the assesee, on the other hand submits that the High Court is right in distinguishing the present case in view of certain distinguishing features of the contract With which we are concerned.5.	Arguments of Respondent
It is wellsettled that whether a particular transaction is a contract of sale or works contract depends upon the true construction of all the terms and conditions of the document when there is one.	None
The question will depend upon the intention of the parties executing the contract.	None
As we have observed ill our judgment in State of Gujarat v. Variety Body Builders(1976 3 S.C.R. 131) which we have just de livered there is no standard formula by which one can distinguish a contract of Sale from contract for work and labour.	None
The question is not always easy and has for all time vexed jurists all over.	None
The distinction between a contract of sale of goods and a contract for work and labour is often a fine one.	None
A contract of sale is contract whose main object is the transfer of the property in and the delivery of the possession of a chattel as a chattel to the buyer.	None
(Halsbury s Laws of England Third Edition Volume 34 page 6.)The contract with which we are concerned in this appeal is found in a tender for the supply of materials containing a memorandum of the conditions.	None
The nature of work is described as manufacturing and supplying kilnburn bricks for construction of Gandhinagar .	None
The question will depend upon the true construction of the tender which on acceptance is treated here as the contract containing all the terms and conditions agreed upon between t he two parties.	None
In the tender the assessee stated I We chairman Sabarmati Rati Udyog Sahakari Mandi Ltd., the undersigned do hereby tender for the supply of the materials described in the Schedule attached herewith subject to the conditions annexed.	None
The schedule described materials as bricks and also stated quantities to be delivered, and rate at which to be supplied.	None
The tender is described as Supply of Materials Tender.	None
Although the above nomenclature, by itself, is not decisive, we find that the same is justified by the principal terms governing the contract to which we will presently refer.	None

While giving the specifications Item No. l herein refers to manufacturing and supplying of 1 Class kiln burnt bricks of standard size including stacking in regular consignments etc. camp.	None
as directed.7.	None
Mr. V. S. Desai brings to our notice the common as well as the distinguishing features of this case and of Chandra Bhan Gosains case (supra).	None
According to him the common features are the followingThe land was given free for manufacture of bricks in both the cases.	None
The materials shall remain at the contractors risk till the date of final delivery.	None
in Chandra Bhan Gosains case (supra) the contractor could not sell the bricks to third parties without previous permission of the company .	None
Here also the contractor has no right to sell the bricks etc.	None
but if he does sell he will have.	None
to pay 10 percent of the value of the materials at the tender rates.	None
Both the Clauses are, therefore, permissive Clauses and a re substantially the same.	None
In both the contracts the contracting parties have used the words such as sell, purchase, deliver or rate of supply etc. in the contract.8.	None
In Chandra Bhan Gosains case (supra) dealing, with those very common features this Court observed as followsIt may be presumed that it was understood that in quoting his rate for the bricks, the appellant would take into account the free supply of earth for making the bricks.	None
A gain what was supplied to the company by the appellant was not the earth which he got from it but bricks, which, we think, are something entirely different.	None
It could not have been in intended that the property in the earth would continue in The company in spite of its conversion into such a different thing as bricks.	None
Further we find that the contract provided that the bricks would remain at the appellants risk till delivery to the comp any.	None
Now, obviously bricks could not remain at the appellants risk unless they were his property.	None
Another Clause provided that the appellant would not be able to sell the bricks to other parties without the permission of the company.	None
Apparently, it was contemplated that without such a provision the appellant could have sold the bricks to others.	None
Now  he could not sell the bricks at all unless they belonged to him.	None
Then we find that in the tender which the appellant submitted and the acceptance of which made the contract, he stated, I we hereby tender for the supply to the Hindus than Steel Private Ltd.	None
Of the materials described in the undermentioned memorandum.	None
The memorandum described the materials as bricks, and also stated the quantities to be delivered and the rate at which materials are to be supplied.	None
All these provisions plainly show that the contract was for sale of bricks.	None
If it were so, the property in the bricks must have been in the appellant and passed from him to the subjectmatter.	None
From the above extract, it is clear.	None
that the decision in Chandra Bhan Gosains case (supra) will govern the p resent case where terms and conditions are almost identical so far as relating to the relevant subjectmatter.9.	None
Mr. Desai, however, took pains to point out certain distinguishing features of the present case such as maintenance of qualified Executive Engineer for supervision of work subject to removal at the instance of the Government restriction on employment of children under 12 years labour welfare provisions regarding wages workmens compensation, etc. provisions in relation to prevention of cruelty to animals nonpayment of royalty for excavating earth use of tubewells standing on the Government site manner of execution of the work regarding moulding and drying and provision against subletting which shall constitute a breach of the contract resulting in forfeiture of security deposit.10.	Reasoning
All the above terms relate to a stage in the process of proper and efficient manufacturing of bricks and are not inconsistent in a contract of sale.	None
These terms do not appear to impinge on the character of the contract as one for sale of the bricks manufactured.	Reasoning
The Government in its overall interest and anxiety for general welfare could insist on compliance with certain beneficial legal measures.	Reasoning
It could also insist on certain terms which will ensure efficient production of the material.	Reasoning
Provision against subletting when the land was given free by Government is also understandable.	Reasoning
All the above features do not negate the concept of a contract of sale of the bricks that are ultimately manufactured.	Reasoning
The true test in this case is whether in making the contract to brick produced was transferred as a chattel for consideration and we are clearly of opinion that this has taken place in this case.	Reasoning
The property in the bricks was entirely of the assessee.	Reasoning
He had not only to manufacture that but also to stack them for facilitating delivery.	Reasoning
The essence of the contract was, therefore.	Reasoning
the delivery of the bricks after manufacture.	Reasoning
The present case cannot be distinguished from the decision of the Chandra Bhan Gosains case (supra).	Reasoning
We are, therefore, clearly of opinion that the contract in this case is a contract of sale and not a works contract.	None
The assessee is, therefore liable to sales tax.	None
The question is answered accordingly.	Decision
The High Court was not right in answering the question in favour of the assessee.	Reasoning
The decision of the High Court is set aside.	Decision
The appeal is allow ed with costs.11.	None
Appeal allowed.	None
