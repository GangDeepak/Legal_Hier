However, by his order dated 18.06.2010 the 3 rd Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad found that no ground to summon the appellants for trial was made out and the complaint being devoid of merits was liable to be dismissed under Section 203 CrPC.	Facts

THAT thereafter 3 new Companies were formed in the names of Reliance Capital Limited, Reliance Energy Limited and Reliance Power Limited under the Company Policy after merging all the above named 4 companies and following shares were issued in the joint names of Arun Kumar Goyal (i.e. complainant) and Devinder Kumar Goyal (a) M s.

THAT in this manner it would be apparent from the above facts that 100 shares of Reliance Industries Co. 2 shares of Reliance Capital Limited 3 shares of Reliance Energy Limited and 12 shares of Reliance Power Limited have been issued in the joint names of Arun Kumar Goyal (i.e. complainant) and Devinder Kumar Goyal.	Facts
These shares were sent by the company at House No.KC102/2, Kavi Nagar, Ghaziabad i.e. the address maintained in their records.	Facts
The originals of all the above shares are available with Devinder Kumar Goyal.	Facts
In this manner, it would be apparent from the above that neither the applicants nor the complainant have purchased these shares from the open market.	Facts
All the shares have been allotted by the company in lieu of the money paid by Suresh Kumar Goyal (i.e. father of Arun Kumar Goyal and Devinder Kumar Goyal) although these shares have been issued by company in the joint names of Arun Kumar Goyal and Devinder Kumar Goyal.	Facts
None of the applicants had given any application in writing for collecting bonus shares nor any one of them ever attempted to sell any of these shares.	Facts
Therefore allegation of the complainant that applicants have obtained bonus shares by cheating and or by forging his signatures, is patently wrong and false and accused emphatically deny the same.	Facts
(illegible).	None
THAT it thus becomes evident from perusal of above facts that no shares have been purchased by Arun Kumar Goyal either from the Company or from the open market.	Facts
Similarly, the acquisition of shares of M s. Amrit Vanaspati Company Ltd. was also dealt with	Facts
and it was asserted THAT all the above shares are in joint names.	None
It is pertinent to mention here that no one can either sell or transfer the shares which are in the joint names nor anyone can change the address, unless and until both the shareholders agree and sign for this.	Facts
THAT no other shares have been purchased except the above shares.	Facts
Therefore, the allegations of complainant that he will furnish details information of one other folio as and when he becomes aware of that, are patently wrong, false and baseless and applicants emphatically deny such allegations.	Facts
THAT it is thus evident from the above facts that all the shares allotted by M s. Reliance Industries have been issued in the joint names of Arun Kumar Goyal (i.e. complainant) and Devinder Kumar Goyal.	Facts
Resultantly Complainant and Devinder Kumar Goyal have equal share in the above shares.	Facts
Originals of all these shares are in the possession of Devinder Kumar Goyal.	Facts
THAT similarly shares allotted by M s. Amrit Vanaspati Company are also in the joint names of Arun Kumar Goyal (i.e. complainant) and Devinder Kumar Goyal and consequently both the complainant and Devinder Kumar Goyal have equal shares in them.	Facts
The originals of these shares are also in possession of Devinder Kumar Goyal.	Facts
THAT Anil Kumar Garg has absolutely nothing to do with this case.	Facts
He is the real Sonin law of Suresh Kumar Goyal and that is why he too has been falsely implicated in this case.	Facts
THAT Suresh Kumar Goyal and Devinder Kumar Goyal even offered the ComplainantArun Kumar Goyal to collect money of his half share in the above shares after selling them in the open market.	Facts
But he is not ready for this offer.	Facts
He is not entitled to demand all the shares.	Facts
The application for discharge was rejected by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court No.3, Ghaziabad vide his order dated 14.06.2011.	Facts
While so rejecting, it was observed that sufficient grounds to frame charges under Sections 420, 323 and 504 IPC were made out.	None
The aforesaid order was challenged by the appellants by filing application under Section 482 CrPC namely Application No.22324 of 2011.	Facts
The High Court noted the contentions on behalf of the appellants as under As applicant no. 1 was not happy with the conduct of the opposite party no.2, he disowned him and also filed O.S. No.406 of 2007 in the court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Ghaziabad for a decree of declaration.	Facts
A criminal complaint was also initiated by applicant no.1 against the opposite party no.2 under Sections 420, 406, 409, 321, 323, 385, 442 IPC.	None
On 2.12.2009, the opposite party no. 2 filed a Complaint Case No.3884 of 2009 against the applicants on the ground that opposite party no. 2 had purchased shares from the Reliance Industries in the name of complainant and applicant no. 2.	Facts
It is further alleged in the complaint that in the year 1997 and in the year 2006 by making forged signature of the complainant bonus shares were received by the applicants and original shares were also in the possession of the applicants.	Facts
In spite of demand same has not been handed over to the complainant.	Facts
It is further alleged in the complaint that applicants with mala fide intention on 9.10.2007 sent a letter to the company which was received to the company on 10.10.2007 and thereafter complainant on 15.8.2009 and 17.8.2009 sent mails to the company in this regard.	Facts
It is submission of the learned counsel for the applicants that shares were purchased by the applicant no. 1, although they were also in the name of opposite party no.2.	Facts
At no point of time any forgery has been committed and preparation of any act cannot be termed as forgery.	Facts
However, the High Court observed that in a petition under Section 482 CrPC disputed questions of fact could not be gone into and whether the shares were purchased by the appellants or by Respondent No.2 was a matter of evidence and as such no interference was called for.	Facts
The aforesaid application was thus dismissed by the High Court on 29.05.2018, which decision is presently under challenge.	Issue
In support of the appeal, it was submitted that the instant complaint was a counter blast after Appellant No.1 had disowned Respondent No.2 by issuing an advertisement in the newspaper and swearing an affidavit to that effect and after he had filed a civil suit seeking injunction against Respondent No.2 from coming to the house of the appellants and causing any hindrance and after a criminal complaint was filed by the Appellant No.1 against Respondent No.2.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that as disclosed in the application under Section 245(2) CrPC, the entire funding for acquisition of the shares in question had come from Appellant No.1 in the year 19921993 when Respondent No.2 was a youngster aged about 24 years.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of the assertion that the acquisition was from the funds of Appellant No.1, the photocopies of the concerned bank accounts were also placed on record.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, the learned counsel for Respondent No.2 reiterated the submission that the issue of ownership was essentially a question of fact which had to be decided in the pending complaint and that the matter ought not to be entertained in an application for discharge.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of the submission that Respondent No.2 had acquired those shares from his own funds, reliance was placed upon a typewritten extract showing debit entries of Rs.1250/, Rs.1250/ and Rs.500/ dated 04.05.1993, 08.06.1994 and 15.10.1994 which extract was however without any details.	Arguments of Respondent
This Court adjourned the matter to enable the parties to arrive at an amicable settlement whereafter the appellants agreed to withdraw all the cases filed by them against Respondent No.2 on the condition that similar such cases filed by Respondent No.2 against them also be withdrawn, giving quietus to all the proceedings between the parties.	None
Respondent No.2, however, did not agree to the proposal.	None
The thrust of the allegations in the complaint is that the shares in question were acquired from the funds of the complainant, though they have always stood in the names of the complainant and his brother.	None
It is also accepted that the shares have always been in the custody of the father i.e. Appellant No.1.	None
Beyond mere allegation that the funds for acquisition came from his bank account, nothing has even been suggested by the complainant.	None
The entries dated 04.05.1993, 08.06.1994 and 15.10.1994 relied upon by him are much after the issuance of 100 debentures by Reliance Polythene Ltd.	None
on15.04.1993.	None
As detailed in the application under Section 245(2) CrPC the basic acquisition was these 100 debentures which investment, with the passage of time, got converted and progressed to the present level.	None
The complainant was not even aware of these details.	None
The allegations of beating and intimidation are of the year 1998 and completely devoid of any substance.	None
The question is are these aspects sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction to discharge the appellants or should the appellants be made to go through the rituals and rigour of trial.	Issue
While dealing with the jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC to quash the proceedings at the stage of issuance of process, or at the stage of committal, or at the stage of framing of charges, that is to say before thecommencement of actual trial, in the light of material placed on record by the accused, this Court in Rajiv Thapar and Others v. Madan Lal Kapoor 1 laid down as under The High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC, must make a just and rightful choice.	None
This is not a stage of evaluating the truthfulness or otherwise of the allegations levelled by the prosecution complainant against the accused.	None
Likewise, it is not a stage for determining how weighty the defences raised on behalf of the accused are.	None
Even if the accused is successful in showing some suspicion or doubt, in the allegations levelled by the prosecution complainant, it would be impermissible to discharge the accused before trial.	None
This is so because it would result in giving finality to the accusations levelled by the prosecution complainant, without allowing the prosecution or the complainant to adduce evidence to substantiate the same.	None
The converse is, however, not true, because even if trial is proceeded with, the accused is not subjected to any irreparable consequences.	None
The accused would still be in a position to succeed by establishing his defences by producing evidence in accordance with law.	None
There is an endless list of judgments rendered by this Court declaring the legal position that in a case where the prosecution complainant has levelled allegations bringing out all ingredients of the charge(s) levelled, and have placed material before the Court, prima facie evidencing the truthfulness of the allegations levelled, trial must be held.	None
1 (2013) 3 SCC 330 The issue being examined in the instant case is the jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 CrPC, if it chooses to quash the initiation of the prosecution against an accused at the stage of issuing process, or at the stage of committal, or even at the stage of framing of charges.	None
These are all stages before the commencement of the actual trial.	None
The same parameters would naturally be available for later stages as well.	None
The power vested in the High Court under Section 482 CrPC, at the stages referred to hereinabove, would have far reaching consequences inasmuch as it would negate the prosecutions complainants case without allowing the prosecution complainant to lead evidence.	None
Such a determination must always be rendered with caution, care and circumspection.	None
To invoke its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC the High Court has to be fully satisfied that the material produced by the accused is such that would lead to the conclusion that his their defence is based on sound, reasonable, and indubitable facts the material produced is such as would rule out and displace the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused and the material produced is such as would clearly reject and overrule the veracity of the allegations contained in the accusations levelled by the prosecution complainant.	None
It should be sufficient to rule out, reject and discard the accusations levelled by the prosecution complainant, without the necessity of recording any evidence.	None
For this the material relied upon by the defence should not have been refuted, or alternatively, cannot be justifiably refuted, being material of sterling and impeccable quality.	None
The material relied upon by the accused should be such as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the actual basis of the accusations as false.	None
In such a situation, the judicial conscience of the High Court would persuade it to exercise its power under Section 482 CrPC to quash such criminal proceedings, for that would prevent abuse of process of the court, and secure the ends of justice.	None
Based on the factors canvassed in the foregoing paragraphs, we would delineate the following steps to determine the veracity of a prayer for quashment raised by an accused by invoking the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 CrPC 30.1.	None
Step one whether the material relied upon by the accused is sound, reasonable, and indubitable i.e. the material is of sterling and impeccable quality?	None
30.2.	None
Step two whether the material relied upon by the accused would rule out the assertions contained in the charges levelled against the accused i.e. the material is sufficient to reject and overrule the factual assertions contained in the complaint i.e. the material is such as would persuade a reasonable person to dismiss and condemn the factual basis of the accusations as false?	None
30.3.	None
Step three whether the material relied upon by the accused has not been refuted by the prosecution complainant and or the material is such that it cannot be justifiably refuted by the prosecution complainant?	None
30.4.	None
Step four whether proceeding with the trial would result in an abuse of process of the court, and would not serve the ends of justice?	None
30.5.	None
If the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, the judicial conscience of the High Court should persuade it to quash such criminal proceedings in exercise of power vested in it under Section 482 CrPC.	None
Such exercise of power, besides doing justice to the accused, would save precious court time, which would otherwise be wasted in holding such a trial (as well as proceedings arising therefrom) specially when it is clear that the same would not conclude in the conviction of the accused.	None
In the present case the shares in question, right since the date of acquisition have always been in the custody of Appellant No.1.	Reasoning
The material on record is absolutely clear that the acquisition was from the funds of Appellant No.1.	Reasoning
The complainant has merely alleged that the funds came from his bank account but beyond such allegations no material has been placed on record at any stage.	Reasoning
The stand taken by the appellants in their application under Section 245(2) CrPC is quite clear that the shares can be sold in the market and the proceeds can be divided between Appellant No.2 and Respondent No.2.	Reasoning
If Respondent No.2 is insisting on having complete ownership in respect of the concerned shares, the matter must first be established before a competent forum.	Reasoning
We have considered the material on record through the steps indicated in Rajiv Thapar v. Madan Lal Kapoor (supra) and are convinced that the instant case calls for interference under Section 482 CrPC.	Reasoning
Further, from the facts that Appellant No.1 had disowned Respondent No.2 and had filed civil proceedings seeking appropriate orders against them, we are also convinced that the present criminal complaint is nothing but an attempt to wreck vengeance against the father, brother and the brother in law of the complainant.	Reasoning
The instant criminal complaint is an abuse of the process of Court and is required to be quashed.	Reasoning
We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the orders passed by the Courts below and allow the application for discharge under Section 245(2) CrPC in complaint No.3804 of 2009 on the file of third Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ghaziabad.	Decision
Since we have found that the initiation of complaint was not a bona fide exercise, we direct Respondent No.2 to pay a sum of Rs.25,000/ (Rupees twenty five thousand only) within two months from today to each of the appellants by way of costs for initiating frivolous litigation	Decision
