During the course of investigation it was found that on 18.5.1988 when the deceased and his friend Nilkanth PW7 had gone to a pan shop when the first accused Gowardhan met him there and took the deceased away from PW7 but PW7 could hear that conversation between A1 and the deceased.	Facts
During the said conversation, PW7 states that A1 asked the deceased for a loan of Rs. 30,000/ but the deceased told A1 that he had only Rs. 25,000/ in his bank account which he would lend to him.	Facts
It is the case of the prosecution that during the course of investigation, PW10 Dinesh Shukla remembered that on 21.5.1988 he had actually seen the deceased in the company of both the accused near the lake which he informed the investigating officer after about a week because he had then left for his village.	Facts
The accused persons were then arrested on 27.5.1988 and A1 allegedly told the I.O. that out of Rs. 25,000 taken by him from the deceased, a sum of Rs. 20,000/ was given to the sister of A2 for safe keeping and Rs. 4,900/ were given to A2 while the balance was pocketed by A1 himself.	Facts

He is also supposed to have told the Police that he had hidden the money given to him by A1 after spending a part thereof under some red stones on the way leading to Dammakheri.	Facts
Even in this regard A2 is supposed to have offered the Police to lead them to the place for recovery of the said money.	None
A2 also allegedly told the Police that he had kept hidden a watch taken from the deceased under the earth in a corner of a wall of the temple near the pond.	None
These statements according to the prosecution, were made to the Police in the presence of PWs.	Facts
17 and 19 and pursuant thereto, the accused persons took these witnesses along with the Police to various places mentioned by him and facilitated the Police to recover the knife, the money and the watch.	Facts
Prosecution through various witnesses examined in the trial, have contended that the watch in question actually belonged to a friend of the deceased who had kept the same with him for safe custody which the deceased had worn at the time when he allegedly left for Indore.	Facts
The prosecution through the evidence of the Bank Manager had also tried to establish the fact that the deceased on 21.5.1988 had withdrawn a sum of Rs. 25,000 in the denomination of 100 rupee notes.	Facts
It is based on the above evidence that the trial court found both A1 and A2 guilty of the offence charged but the High Court while allowing the appeal of A1, has convicted A2.	Facts
We have heard Ms. Rachna Gupta, learned counsel fort he appellant and Ms. Bibha Datta Makhija, learned counsel for the respondentState.	None
It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the only evidence that has been accepted as against this appellant by the High Court is that of the recovery which part of the prosecution evidence has not been accepted by the said court in regard to the first accused who even according to the prosecution, was the person who had taken the loan of Rs. 25,000, still the High Court erroneously accepted this part of the prosecution case to confirm the conviction as against the appellant which ought not to have been done.	Arguments of Petitioner
That apart, it is contended that the story of recovery of knife, watch and the money is so artificial that the same cannot be accepted by any prudent person.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also pointed out that out of the 2 witnesses who were Panchayatdars for all these recoveries, PW17 is a stock recovery witness for the Police in a large number of cases and his evidence in the court in this case shows that in reality the recoveries were not made at the behest of A2 or from the place as alleged by the prosecution.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel for the respondentState, per contra, has contended that the mere fact that PW17 was a witness for recovery in many earlier cases, ipso facto does not make the recovery bad in the eye of law.	Arguments of Respondent
That apart, it is not only PW17 who has been a witness to the recoveries, there was PW19 also who cannot be termed as a stock witness therefore the argument that the recoveries should not be believed, has no merit.	Arguments of Respondent
She contended that a recent and unexplained possession of properties of the deceased by the accused justifies the presumption that it was the said accused and no one else had committed the murder which according to learned counsel, is permissible under Section 114(a) of the Evidence Act.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of this contention of hers, learned counsel relied on a judgment of this Court in Baiju alias Bharosa vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (1978 1 SCC 588 ).	Arguments of Respondent
She further pointed out from the material on record that the appellant herein had taken a specific stand that on the date of the incident, he was not in Mandsaur but was away from there.	Arguments of Respondent
He had set up a plea of alibi which has been found to be not true by both the courts below therefore setting up of a false alibi in a case involving only circumstantial evidence would also be a circumstance to be taken note of as a link indicating the guilt of the accused.	Arguments of Respondent
In support of this proposition, she relied on a judgment of this Court in Mani Kumar Thapa vs. State of Sikkim (2002 (7) SCC 157 ).	Arguments of Respondent
As could be seen from the prosecution case itself the motive for the murder seems to be the receipt of Rs. 25,000 by A1 from the deceased.	None
We really do not find from the facts of this case how that could be a motive be it for A1 or A2 to do away with the deceased.	None
It is the prosecution case itself that the deceased and A1 were good friends and when he asked for a loan of Rs. 30,000 the deceased willingly agreed to give him Rs. 25,000/ which he had.	Reasoning
If that be so, we do not find any reason whatsoever for any one of these accused to kill the deceased after having received the said amount.	Reasoning
We also do not see the reasoning behind the prosecution case that A1 having received a sum of Rs. 25,000 why he would give the money to the sister of A2 and a part of it to A2 himself without retaining any substantial part with him.	Reasoning
From the evidence on record we notice that it was PW7 who has spoken in regard to this monetary transaction which from his own evidence we find difficult to believe.	None
It is his case that on 18.5.1988, i.e. 3 days prior to the alleged murder, A1 met the deceased at the pan shop where deceased and PW7 had gone and A1 had taken the deceased away from PW7 which distance according to the evidence of PW7 himself is about 500700 meters.	None
If that be so, we fail to understand how PW7 could have really overheard the conversation between the deceased and A1.	None
At any rate, we notice that the High Court has not accepted this part of the prosecution case in regard to A1.	None
Then the learned counsel appearing for the appellant had very seriously contended that the evidence led by the prosecution in regard to recovery of knife, money and wristwatch is so artificial that the same cannot be accepted by any reasonable person.	None
Having perused the evidence of PW17, one of the Panchayatdars for recovery and the Investigating officer, PW20, we find sufficient force in this argument of learned counsel for the appellant.	None
It is seen that the shop of PW17 is about 11/2 kms.	None
away from the Police Station in question, there were many other shops and houses inbetween, still the I.O. decided to specifically look for and get PW17 as a Panchayatdar for the recovery.	None
From the evidence of PW17, we notice that undoubtedly, he is a stock witness who has been appearing as a witness for recovery on behalf of the prosecution even as far back as the year 1965, we will have to be very cautious in accepting his evidence.	None
The manner in which the alleged recovery is made also creates a lot of doubt in our mind.	None
It is seen from the evidence led by the prosecution that at every place where the accused took the Panchayatdars and the Police, according to the prosecution witnesses themselves, there were thousands of people present witnessing the recovery.	None
We find it extremely difficult that such a large gathering would be present at the recovery unless people in the village had already come to know that there is going to be such a recovery.	None
Then the manner in which the currency notes were allegedly kept in a damp area under a rock also creates doubt in our mind since no prudent man would conceal currency notes in such a place.	None
Then there is a very serious doubt about the recovery of the wrist watch.	None
It is stated that on 28.5.1988 the wrist watch in question was recovered from the place where it was hidden and was seized and sealed in an envelope to which PWs.	None
10, 17 and 19 appended their signatures.	None
But surprisingly, when the sealed packet was opened in the court, it was found that the watch was wrapped in a newspaper dated 3.6.1988  a newspaper published about 6 days after the date of seizure.	None
PW10 who is the I.O. when confronted with this contradiction, has pleaded his inability to given any explanation in regard to this.	None
However, the prosecution through the evidence of PW11 has made an effort to explain away this serious infirmity in the recovery of the wrist watch.	None
This witness says that the sealed packet which contained the wrist watch was opened in his presence on 15.6.1988 on which date he was posted as a Naib Tehsildar in the Tehsil office for the purpose of getting the watch identified by PW10, Dinesh Shukla.	None
But for this opening of the packet which was sealed on 28.5.1988, PWs.	None
17 and 19 who had put their signatures were not parties nor are they parties for resealing of this watch in the newspaper of 3.6.1988.	None
If that be so, we fail to understand what evidentiary value can be attached to the recovery of the wrist watch.	None
The very purpose for which the wrist watch was packed and sealed with signatures of PWs.17 and 19 on 28.5.1988 is lost by the opening of the packet in their absence.	None
The prosecution cannot prove that the wrist watch recovered on 28.5.1988 at the instance of A2 is the same watch which was produced in court during the trial.	None
Our suspicion in regard to the genuineness of the recoveries gets compounded by this factum of opening of the sealed articles in the absence of original Panchayatdars.	None
In the present case, the inability of the I.O. to explain the change in packaging makes the seizure further doubtful.	Reasoning
This serious error in the background of the fact that even though many independent witnesses were available as Panchayatdars for the recovery, the prosecutions act of using an admittedly stock witness like PW17 and the manner and the place in which these recovered objects were allegedly concealed, throws great suspicion in the alleged recoveries which is foundation of the prosecution case against the appellant.	Reasoning
The argument of learned counsel for the respondent in regard to the presumption that could be drawn from the alleged recovery as to the crime committed by the person from whom such recovery is made or his false alibi as supported by the decisions relied on by her, will be of no assistance to the prosecution case.	Reasoning
A presumption under Section 114(a) could be drawn only if the factum of recovery is proved beyond reasonable doubt which in this case we have held is not done because the recoveries are highly doubtful.	Reasoning
Therefore, on such doubtful recoveries, a presumption as to the guilt of the accused cannot be drawn.	Reasoning
We agree with the learned counsel for the respondentState that in a case of circumstantial evidence, a false alibi set up by the accused would be a link in the chain of circumstances as held by this Court in the case of Mani Kumar Thapa (supra) but then it cannot be the sole link or the sole circumstance based on which a conviction could be passed.	Reasoning
In the instant case we have held that a substantial part of the prosecution case which involves both A1 and A2 has been disbelieved by the High Court so far as A1 is concerned and the conviction was confirmed as against A2 by the High Court based on the recoveries made and the said recovery having been disbelieved by us, the sole circumstance against the appellant remains to be his alibi which in our opinion, is not sufficient for basing a conviction.	Reasoning
We are of the considered opinion that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that this appellant is responsible for the murder of the deceased, and for throwing his body is the lake, consequently, the charge under Section 201 should also fail.5.	Reasoning
For the reasons stated above, this appeal is allowed.	Decision
The judgment, the conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant herein are set aside.	Decision
The appellant shall be released forthwith, if not wanted in any other case.	Decision
