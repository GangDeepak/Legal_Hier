Certain other connected cases were also dealt with.	Facts
In all these appeals the question is whether the Department would prefer appeals and or file petitions without obtaining clearance from the Committee of Disputes (in short COD) constituted in terms of order of this Court.	Issue
According to the High Court it was necessary to refer the matter to the said Committee.	Facts
The High Court held that the same was to be done within a period of one month in terms of the order of this Court in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Collector of Central Excise (2004 (6) SCC 437 ).	Facts
Accordingly the appeals were dismissed.3.	Facts
The High Court held that since this Court had set the time frame there is no scope for any deviation therefrom.	None
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is really no statutory and or rigidly framed time limit.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Court only highlighted the desirability of early action so that unnecessary litigation can be avoided.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that in some cases the concerned Committee has also declined to grant permission and those appeals have become infructuous.	Arguments of Respondent
In Oil and Natural Gas Commissions case (supra) this Court observed as follows It is also clarified that even the pending matters before any court or tribunal should also be the subjectmatter of the deliberations of the HighPowered Committee.	Arguments of Respondent
All the matters pending as of today either instituted by the Union of India or any of the public sector undertakings shall within one month from today be referred by the appellant or the petitioner, as the case may be, to the HighPowered Committee.	Arguments of Respondent
The HighPowered Committee will deal with these matters most expeditiously and endeavour to resolve the matters.6.	Arguments of Respondent
Accordingly, there should be no bar to the lodgement of an appeal or petition either by the Union of India or the public sector undertakings before any court or tribunal so as to save limitation.	Reasoning
But, before such filing every endeavour should be made to have the clearance of the HighPowered Committee.7.	Reasoning
However, as to what the court or tribunal should do if such judicial remedies are sought before such a court or tribunal, the order of 111019911 clarifies (SCC p. 542, para 4)4.	Reasoning
It shall be the obligation of every court and every tribunal where such a dispute is raised hereafter to demand a clearance from the Committee in case it has not been so pleaded and in the absence of the clearance, the proceedings would not be proceeded with.8.	Reasoning
Wherever appeals, petitions, etc. are filed without the clearance of the HighPowered Committee so as to save limitation, the appellant or the petitioner, as the case may be, shall within a month from such filing, refer the matter to the HighPowered Committee, with prior notice to the designated authority in the Cabinet Secretariat of the Government of India authorised to receive notices in that behalf.	Reasoning
Shri K.T.S. Tulsi, learned Additional Solicitor General stated that in order to coordinate these references of the HighPowered Committee the Government proposes to nominate the UnderSecretary (Coordination) in the Cabinet Secretariat as the nodal authority to coordinate these references.	Reasoning
The reference shall be deemed to have been made and become effective only after a notice of the reference is lodged with the said nodal authority.	Reasoning
The reference shall be deemed to be valid if made in the case of the Union of India by its Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, and in the case of public sector undertakings by its Chairman, Managing Director or Chief Executive, as the case may be.	Reasoning
It is only after such reference to the HighPowered Committee is made in the manner indicated that the operation of the order or proceedings under challenge shall be suspended till the HighPowered Committee resolves the dispute or gives clearance to the litigation.	Reasoning
If the HighPowered Committee is unable to resolve the matter for reasons to be recorded by it, it shall grant clearance for the litigation.	Reasoning

Referring to the order passed by this Court on 11.10.1991 i.e. Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Anr.	Reasoning
V. Collector of Central Excise (1995 Supp (4) SCC 541), this Court held that in the matter of setting up of the function of the High Powered Committee for resolving disputes between Union of India on one hand and Public Undertaking on the other required some clarification as some misconception arose.7.	Reasoning
In ONGC Case No.	Reasoning
I i.e. (1995 Supp (4) SCC 541) in para 3 it was noted as follows We direct that the Government of India shall set up a Committee consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Industry, the Bureau of Public Enterprises and the Ministry of Law, to monitor disputes between Ministry and Ministry of Government of India, Ministry and public sector undertakings of the Government of India and public sector undertakings in between themselves, to ensure that no litigation comes to Court or to a Tribunal without the matter having been first examined by the Committee and its clearance for litigation.	Reasoning
Government may include a representative of the Ministry concerned in a specific case and one from the Ministry of Finance in the Committee.	Reasoning
Senior officers only should be nominated so that the Committee would function with status, control and discipline.	Reasoning
In para 4 it was further observed as follows It shall be the obligation of every Court and every Tribunal where such a dispute is raised hereafter to demand a clearance from the Committee in case it has not been so pleaded and in the absence of the clearance, the proceedings would not be proceeded with.	Reasoning
Subsequently, the disputes involving the State Governments and the Public Sector Undertakings have been considered by this Court and one such matter was dealt with in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. V. City Industrial Development Corporation, Maharashtra Ltd. And Ors.	Reasoning
(2007 (7) SCC 39 ).10.	Reasoning
It needs to be emphasized that there was actually no rigid time frame indicated by this Court.	Reasoning
The emphasis on one months time was to show urgency needed.	Reasoning
Merely because there is some delay in approaching the Committee that does not make the action illegal.	Reasoning
The Committee is required to deal with the matter expeditiously so that there is no unnecessary backlog of appeals which ultimately may not be pursued.	Reasoning
In that sense, it is imperative that the concerned authorities take urgent action otherwise the intended objective would be frustrated.	Reasoning
There is no scope for lethargy.	Reasoning
It is to be tested by the Court as to whether there was any indifference and lethargy and in appropriate cases refuse to interfere.	Reasoning
In these cases factual position is not that.	Reasoning
Therefore, we set aside the order of the High Court in each case and direct consideration of the question of desirability to proceed in the matter before it on receipt of the report from the concerned Committee.	Reasoning
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that even if the Committee has declined to grant permission it is still open to raise the issues in appropriate proceedings.	Arguments of Petitioner
We express no opinion in that regard.	Arguments of Petitioner
But where the Committee has declined to deal with the matter on the ground of belated approach, the same cannot be sustained in view of our present order.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Committee has to consider the matter on merits.	None
It is to be noted that where permission has been granted by the Committee there is no impediment on the Court to examine the matter and take a decision on merits.	None
But where there is no belated approach as noted above, the matter has to be decided.	None
Court has to decide whether because of unexplained delay and lethargic action it would decline to entertain the matters.	None
That would depend on the factual scenario in each case, and no straight jacket formula can be adopted.	None
The appeals are accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent.	Decision
There will be no order as to costs.	Decision
