On appeal before the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the Division Bench of the High Court by the impugned judgment affirmed the convictions and sentences passed against the appellants and also against the deceased appellant Labhu Ram and dismissed the appeal.	Facts
Mr. Sushi Kumar, the learned Senior counsel appearing for the remaining three appellants, has submitted that the case of the prosecution is not believable at all.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was highly improbable that the appellants having purchased the house in the village with their eyes open that it was tenanted where Piara Singh had been residing with the members of his family would demolish the wall of the said house in an attempt to take forcible possession.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has also submitted that it is also highly improbable that only because the deceased and some other persons intended to mediate in the matter and wanted to settle the dispute between the appellants and the said Piara Singh after looking to the said sale deed, the appellants would become so enraged they would go to the house of the deceased in early hours of the morning and start abusing the deceased and threaten him with dire consequences.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has submitted that if the appellants had really intended to kill the deceased, they would not have murdered him after shouting and thereby inviting others to come and witness the commission of the crime.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has also submitted that admittedly the body of the deceased was found inside the house of the appellants and no blood mark could be noticed in support of the prosecution case of carrying the said body from the place of incident to the house of the appellants which was admittedly about 60 to 70 yards away.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has also submitted that wife of Labhu Ram has deposed that the deceased had come to their house in drunken state at night and started abusing the members of the family and had been threatening to molest the daughters in the house.	Arguments of Petitioner
But the deceased being drunken, could not take care of him and fell down from the wall thereby receiving injuries which caused his death.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has submitted that in the instant case only contusions, lacerated wounds and abrasions were found on the body of the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
If sua and lathis had been freely used by the all the appellants with intention to murder the deceased, the doctor ought to have noted several other serious injuries on head and other vital parts of the body.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has submitted that it is significant to note that there was no punctured wound which would be caused if sua blows were given.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has also submitted that fracture of ribs and consequential damage of pleura and lungs was also not improbable, if a person falls from a height.9.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has strongly contended that the appellant Malkiat Singh has been falsely implicated by the prosecution.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said Malkiat Singh was fairly educated and was an Enforcement Inspector in the Agricultural Department.	Arguments of Petitioner
He had been staying in a separate house at New Janta Nagar and not at the family residence at Dashmesh Nagar.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has submitted that Malkiat Singh being informed at about 2.30 a.m. by three neighbours of the Mohalla Dashmesh Nagar that some persons being drunk had been abusing and creating nuisance at the Dashmesh Nagar Mohalla where the family residence was situated, he left his residence at New Janta Nagar and in the company of the said persons went to the police out post Basant Park for lodging the said information so that no untoward incident would happen in his Mohalla.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar had submitted that the fact that Malkiat Singh had in fact gone to the police out post, stands corroborated by the copy of the report lodged by him since acknowledged in writing by the Munshi of the said police out post.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has submitted that even if it is assumed that the said Malkiat Singh, on the date of the incident was present in the Dashmesh Nagar residence, it is highly improbable that he and his ailing old father would come out of their house in the early morning and would go near the house of the deceased and start hurling abuses on the deceased and even when the widow and other witnesses had come there and had persuaded the accused not to create trouble, he and other accused would indulge in assaulting the deceased in the presence of eyewitnesses.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has submitted that such case is highly improbable.	Arguments of Petitioner
Malkiat, his old ailing father and other family members were deliberately and falsely implicated in order to wreak vengeance on the deceased Labhu Ram and his three sons.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has also submitted that in the instant case no punctured wound was noticed on the person of the deceased even when according to the prosecution case, one of the appellants was armed with sua.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has submitted that in any event, the nature of injuries only indicates that the persons who had assaulted the deceased had no intention of killing him but had intended to give him some thrashing.	Arguments of Petitioner
Unfortunately some vital parts got injured in the incident resulting in death of the said deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has submitted that in such case, the conviction under Section 302 read with section 34 is not at all warranted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has submitted that it transpires from postmortem examination that sua was not used and no injury was caused on the head of the deceased by lathis.	Arguments of Petitioner
Absence of such injuries only indicates that the accused did not share any common intention to cause the death of the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
Hence, the conviction for murder with the aid of section 34 of the IPC was wholly unjustified.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has, therefore, submitted that the Court should discard the prosecution case and acquit the appellants.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any event, the court will not accept the prosecution case in implicating Malkiat Singh.	Arguments of Petitioner
Considering the defence evidence which amply supports the defence of Malkiat Singh that he was not present at the time of incident, Malkiat should be acquitted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Sushil Kumar has also submitted even if the involvement of the other two appellants is believed to be true they do not deserve to be punished under Section 302 read with section 34 of the IPC.	Arguments of Petitioner
But if the prosecution case about causing lathi injuries by them on the deceased is accepted, the remaining two appellants may be punished for causing grievous hurt.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel for the State has, however, disputed the said contention of Mr. Sushil Kumar.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the State that in the instant case there are three injured witnesses.	Arguments of Respondent
Besides Bhagwan Kaur, the widow of the deceased, (PW.4), who received simple injuries on her person, Piara Singh PW 5 and Gurdial Singh PW 6 also received injuries at the hands of the accused.	Arguments of Respondent
Such injuries convincingly establish the presence of the injured witnesses at the time of the incident.	Arguments of Respondent
Such injuries also completely rule out the defence case that the deceased had climbed the wall of the house of the accused and on account of fall from the wall he had died inside their house.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel for the State has submitted that in the event of a fall from a wall which was only five feet high, there would not have been serious injuries as noted by the doctor.	Arguments of Respondent
He has submitted that the defence case was blatantly false.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been convincingly established that the incident happened at the spot mentioned in the FIR.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel for the State has also submitted that immediately within an hour of the incident, FIR was lodged at the Police Station which was about 11/2 miles away from the place of the incident and the learned Magistrate also received a copy of the FIR within two hours of lodging the FIR.	Arguments of Respondent
It is highly improbable that within such a short time a false story would be cooked up and FIR would be lodged on the basis of a false case.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel has also submitted that PW 5 Piara Singh and PW 6 Gurdev Singh both the injured witnesses are neighbours of the deceased.	Arguments of Respondent
Their presence, at the time of the incident, is quite probable.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel has also submitted that the evidence of Bhagwan Kaur PW 4 should not be discarded.	Arguments of Respondent
The widow would have natural inclination to implicate the assailant of her husband and it is not reasonably expected that she would falsely implicate the accused even when she had witnessed the incident and suffered injuries at the hands of the assailants.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel for the State has also submitted that alibi of the accused Malkiat Singh about his going to the police out post shortly before the incident does not stand scrutiny.	Arguments of Respondent
It is with a clever attempt to create alibi, that a false report was made at Basant Park out post at a later stage.	None
It could not be convincingly established by Malkiat Singh that the said report had in fact been lodged at 3 a.m.	None
It is also highly improbable that three neighbours of his Mohalla after noticing some persons in drunken state and creating nuisance by abusing, would come to Malkiat Singh at dead of night at 2.30 a.m. by travelling 11/2 miles only to inform about such nuisance being created by some drunkards instead of going straight to the police station and informing the police, particularly when police station is closer, being only at a distance of one mile from their Mohalla.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel has submitted that it is equally improbable that the said Malkiat Singh, simply on getting an information that some persons were creating disturbance in intoxicated condition in the Mohalla, would come out of his house at that odd hour and personally go to the police out post just to lodge a report of the information received by him from some residents of the Mohalla.	None
It is also significant to note that in the said report to the police out post (Exhibit DO), Malkiat Singh has given his address as house No. 345, street No. 5, Dashmesh Nagar, Ludhiana and not his residence at New Janta Colony which according to him is his usual place of residence.	None
It is quite probable that having participated the crime, Malkiat Singh wanted to cover up his complicity in the offence and in an attempt to create an alibi, he introduced a false story and lodged a report to a police outpost long after the incident.	None
According to learned counsel for the State, the prosecution case has been very convincingly proved by clinching and reliable evidences given by the eyewitnesses.	None
Both the learned Sessions Judge and also the High Court accepted the prosecution case.	None
In the aforesaid circumstance, no interference is called for by this Court and the appeal should be dismissed.	Decision
After giving our anxious considerations of the facts and circumstances of the case and the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for the parties, it appears to us that in the instant case the depositions of Bhagwan Kaur PW 4 and two injured eyewitnesses, namely, PW 5 and PW 6 are wholly reliable.	Reasoning
Such depositions do not suffer from any inconsistency.	Reasoning
In our view, conviction can be based on the said depositions of the eyewitnesses.	None
The case sought to be made out by the accused about the circumstances causing the death of Bhanan Singh is not only false but absolutely absurd.	None
The nature of injuries sustained by the deceased also rules out the case of the defence that the deceased went to the house of the accused being drunk and attempted to go inside the house of the accused by scaling the wall while abusing the inmates and threatening to molest the daughters in the house of Labhu Ram, but suffered a fall from the wall of the house of the accused and died at the spot on receiving injuries on account of such fall from the wall.	Reasoning
The wall is only five feet high and serious injuries suffered by the deceased could not have occurred by a fall from such small height.	Reasoning
It is a pity that the wife of accused Labhu Ram was examined by the accused to give a false and absurd account of the defence case.12.	Reasoning
In our view, the learned counsel for the State is also justified in contending that the alibi of Malkiat Singh that he had been to the said police outpost at 3 a.m. to lodge an information about the presence of some drunkards in Dashmesh Nagar Mohalla is absolutely false and should be discarded.	Reasoning
It appears to us that after the commission of the crime alleged against him, Malkiat wanted to create an alibi and lodged a report at a later stage in the said police outpost.	None
It appears from the postmortem examination that the deceased had been brutally assaulted by the accused thereby causing 19 injuries on his person.	None
The evidences adduced by the eye witnesses about the injuries caused to the deceased also tallies with the postmortem report and deposition of the doctor.	Reasoning
In our view, such injuries would not have been caused if the accused did not intend to kill him.	Reasoning
There is also evidence that even when the deceased fell down after receiving injuries, he was not spared but the accused further assaulted him.	Reasoning
Such conduct of the accused is only consistent with an intention to kill the deceased.13.	Reasoning
Therefore, no interference is called for in this case and the appeal is dismissed.	Decision
It may be stated here that initially bail was granted by this Court to the deceased Labhu Ram and the appellant Malkiat Singh.	Decision
Later on, the other appellants had also been granted bail by this Court.	Decision
In view of the dismissal of their appeal, the appellants should be taken into custody forth with so as to serve out the sentences passed against them.	Decision
