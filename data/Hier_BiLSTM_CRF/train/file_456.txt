Arguments of Petitioner
We have heard Shri Fali S. Nariman, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant and Shri Aditya Swarup, learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.1.	None
Shri Fali s. Nariman in his imitable style in support of review petitions submits that substantial questions of law has been raised in the present review petitions, which need to be addressed and decided by this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Nariman submits that after amendment of Section 8 of 1996 Act by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of 2016), by which Parliament had added the words notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court in Section 8 of the Arbitration Act w.e.f. 23.10.2015, the Parliamentary intendment is clear that after the said amendment, the judicial authority is mandated to refer a dispute for arbitration if there is a valid arbitration agreement and parties apply not later than the date of submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submits that the above words cannot be treated as redundant while interpreting the amended Section 8.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that this Court acting as an Appellate Court under Section 23 of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 read with Section 37(1)(a) of 1996 Act has duty to go into every fact and law including the amendment made in Section 8 of the 1996 Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that Constitution Bench of this Court has already held that consumer fora are covered by the term judicial authority for the purposes of Section 8 of the 1996 Act, hence, it was obligatory for the Commission to refer the dispute to arbitration in view of the arbitration clause between the parties.	Arguments of Petitioner
NCDRC has wrongly termed consumer disputes as nonarbitrable, which is contrary to the decision of this Court in National Seeds Corporation Limited Vs. M. Madhusudan Reddy and Another, (2012) 2 SCC 506.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Court had interpreted the words notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court as occurring in newly added Section 11(6A) of the 1996 Act in Duro Felguera, S.A. Vs. Gangavaram Port Limited, (2017) 9 SCC 729 , which interpretation is equally applicable to Section 8 as amended by Act 3 of 2016.	Arguments of Petitioner
NCDRC has erred in relying on judgment of this Court in A. Ayyasamy Vs. A. Paramasivam and Others, (2016) 10 SCC 386.	Arguments of Petitioner
The amendment in Section 8 of Arbitration Act by Act 3 of 2016 now makes it obligatory to judicial authority to refer disputes to arbitration notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Judgments of this Court interpreting Section 8 prior to 2016 amendment, thus, have become wholly irrelevant and have to be disregarded while deciding the application under Section 8 filed after 2016 amendment.	None
10.	Arguments of Petitioner
Referring to Section 2(3) of the 1996 Act, it is submitted that it cannot be said that by reason of provision of Consumer Protection Act, consumer disputes cannot be submitted to arbitration.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that far from the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, providing either expressly or by necessary implication that consumer disputes may not be submitted to arbitration, the law as explained in the National Seeds Corporation Limited (supra) and in Rosedale Developers Private Limited (supra) clearly shows that arbitration of consumer disputes is definitely envisaged and contemplated in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, itself, before the amendment by way of substitution of Section 8(1) of the 1996 Act, it was at the option of the complainant (under Section 8(1) as enacted) to either go to arbitration as provided for in the arbitration agreement or to file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that after the substitution of Section 8(1) even this option is no longer available, it being mandatory for the judicial authority (NCDRC) to refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists .	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Aditya Swarup, learned counsel appearing for the respondent in his short and impressive submissions contends that the Consumer Act, 1986 provides for an additional and beneficial remedy to the consumer to avail of the speedy, expeditious disposal of his or her dispute.	Arguments of Respondent
The consequences of allowing the present petition and setting aside the impugned order would, inter alia, be that every consumer, no matter how small or big the dispute, would now be forced to adjudicate his dispute before an arbitral tribunal and not avail of the beneficial remedy provided to him or her.	Arguments of Respondent
Under the 1986 Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Accepting the interpretation placed by the appellant on the 1996 Act will mean collapsing of entire edifice of consumer jurisprudence but also jurisprudence relating to trusts, tenancy disputes, industrial disputes, telecom disputes, intellectual property disputes and other nonarbitral disputes.	Arguments of Respondent
Repeating the words of NCDRC, it is submitted that the ripples of the amendment to Section 8(1) cannot be so large as to inundate the domains of other legislations and jurisprudence, painstakingly built by the Legislators and Courts, especially without any engagement, debate and critique with the foundations of these related laws .	Arguments of Respondent
Section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act expressly states that Part I of the Arbitration Act shall not affect any other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be referred to arbitration .	Arguments of Respondent
Under this Section, if any law provides, either expressly or by necessary implication that specified disputes may not be submitted to arbitration, then, in spite of the non obstante provision in Section 5 of the Arbitration Act, the law will be saved by Section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act restricts the overriding effect apparent in Section 5 of the Arbitration Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The Consumer Act being a beneficial legislation enacted to give an additional remedy for the settlement of disputes, the same cannot be taken away by Section 8 of the 1996 Act.	Arguments of Respondent
This Court in jurisdiction cases have already held that Arbitration Act does not exclude the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum to decide disputes under the Consumer Act.	Arguments of Respondent
The amendment to Section 8(1) of the Arbitration Act by Act 3 of 2016 was never intended to interfere with the jurisdiction of Consumer Forum to decide consumer disputes.	Arguments of Respondent
He submits that amendment in Section 8(1) is being read in a manner which was never the intention of the Parliament.	Arguments of Respondent
He submits that the NCDRC has rightly rejected the application under Section 8 filed by the appellant and no error has been committed by this Court in dismissing the appeal, hence, the present petitions are liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
From the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and pleadings of the parties following are the principal issues which arise for consideration in these petitions (i) Whether NCDRC committed error in rejecting the application of the appellant filed under Section 8 of 1996, Act praying for reference to the arbitrator as per Arbitration clause in the builders agreement?	Issue
(ii) Whether after the amendments made in Section 8 by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment)Act, 2015 the application filed under Section 8 by the appellant could not have been rejected in view of substantial changes brought in the statutory scheme by inserting the words notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court in subsection (1) of Section 8?	None
(iii) Whether NCDRC as well as this Court committed error in not adverting to the above statutory amendment which completely changed the legal position as was earlier existing prior to the aforesaid amendment?	Issue
(iv) Whether by the insertion of words notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court under Section 8(1) by the (Amendment) Act, 2015 legislature intended to do away with the decision of judgments of Supreme Court laying down that Consumer Protection Act being special remedy can be initiated and continued despite there being any arbitration agreement between the parties?	Issue
All the issues being interconnected are being taken together.	None
The main emphasis of Shri Fali S. Nariman, learned senior counsel for the petitioner is that entire legal regime pertaining to the 1996, Act in relation to Consumer Protection Act when seen after the amendment fully supports the interpretation put by the petitioner which has not at all adverted by the NCDRC and this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Before we come to the amendments made by the 2015, Act and its real intent and consequences, it is necessary to look into the law as was existing prior to the said amendment in relation to proceedings under Consumer Protection Act in reference to arbitration agreement under 1996 Act.	None
The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has been enacted to provide for better protection of the interests of consumers and for the purpose, to make provision for the establishment of Consumer Councils and other authorities for the settlement of consumer disputes and for matter connected therewith.	None
This Court had occasion to consider the object and purpose of the Act in Lucknow Development Act vs. M.K. Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243 , this Court elaborately noticed the object and purpose of the Act in the following words To begin with the preamble of the Act, which can afford useful assistance to ascertain the legislative intention, it was enacted, to provide for the protection of the interest of consumers.	None
Use of the word protection furnishes key to the minds of makers of the Act.	None
Various definitions and provisions which elaborately attempt to achieve this objective have to be construed in this light without departing from the settled view that a preamble cannot control otherwise plain meaning of a provision.	None
In fact the law meets long felt necessity of protecting the common man from such wrongs for which the remedy under ordinary law for various reasons has become illusory.	None
Various legislations and regulations permitting the State to intervene and protect interest of the consumers have become a haven for unscrupulous ones as the enforcement machinery either does not move or it moves ineffectively, inefficiently and for reasons which are not necessary to be stated.	None
The importance of the Act lies in promoting welfare of the society by enabling the consumer to participate directly in the market economy.	None
It attempts to remove the helplessness of a consumer which he faces against powerful business, described as, a network of rackets or a society in which, producers have secured power to rob the rest and the might of public bodies which are degenerating into storehouses of inaction where papers do not move from one desk to another as a matter of duty and responsibility but for extraneous consideration leaving the common man helpless, bewildered and shocked.	None
The malady is becoming so rampant, widespread and deep that the society instead of bothering, complaining and fighting against it, is accepting it as part of life.	None
The enactment in these unbelievable yet harsh realities appears to be a silver lining, which may in course of time succeed in checking the rot.	None
Section 3 of the Act provided that the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force.	None
Noticing the object and purpose of the Act as well as Section 3, this Court in Secretary, Thirumurugan Cooperative Agricultural Credit Society vs. M. Lalitha (dead) Through LRs.	None
And others, (2004) 1 SCC 395, laid down following in paragraph 11 and 12 From the Statement of Objects and Reasons and the scheme of the 1986 Act, it is apparent that the main objective of the Act is to provide for better protection of the interest of the consumer and for that purpose to provide for better redressal, mechanism through which cheaper, easier, expeditious and effective redressal is made available to consumers.	None
To serve the purpose of the Act, various quasi judicial forums are set up at the district, State and national level with wide range of powers vested in them.	None
These quasijudicial forums, observing the principles of natural justice, are empowered to give relief of a specific nature and to award, wherever appropriate, compensation to the consumers and to impose penalties for noncompliance with their orders.	None
As per Section 3 of the Act, as already stated above, the provisions of the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other provisions of any other law for the time being in force.	None
Having due regard to the scheme of the Act and purpose sought to be achieved to protect the interest of the consumers better, the provisions are to be interpreted broadly, positively and purposefully in the context of the present case to give meaning to additional extended jurisdiction, particularly when Section 3 seeks to provide remedy under the Act in addition to other remedies provided under other Acts unless there is a clear bar.	None
This court had occasion to consider the provisions of Section 34 of Arbitration Act, 1940 in reference to the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 in Fair Air Engineering Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. N.K. Modi, (1996) 6 SCC 385.	None
This Court in the said case held that consumer fora is a judicial authority.	None
In the above case, the appellant had entered into a contract with the respondent to carry out installation of a centrally airconditioned plant in the residential house of the respondent.	None
The respondent filed a complaint before the State Commission under the Consumer Protection At, 1986 which proceedings were stayed by the State Commission and it relegated the parties to arbitration proceedings.	None
The NCDRC held that the proceedings before the Consumer fora is not a legal proceedings and Commission is not a judicial authority, therefore, Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 is not available to stay the proceedings.	None
The said order of NCDRC was challenged in this Court.	None
This Court reversed the order of the State Commission and remitted the matter to the State Commission to decide the matter on merits according to law.	None
This Court held that the Parliament was well aware of the Arbitration Act, 1940 when the Consumer Protection Act was enacted providing for additional remedy.	None
In paragraphs 15 and 16 following has been laid down 15.	None
Accordingly, it must be held that the provisions of the Act are to be construed widely to give effect to the object and purpose of the Act.	None
It is seen that Section 3 envisages that the provisions of the Act are in addition to and are not in derogation of any other law in force.	None
It is true, as rightly contended by Shri Suri, that the words in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force would be given proper meaning and effect and if the complaint is not stayed and the parties are not relegated to the arbitration, the Act purports to operate in derogation of the provisions of the Arbitration Act.	None
Prima facie, the contention appears to be plausible but on construction and conspectus of the provisions of the Act we think that the contention is not well founded.	None
Parliament is aware of the provisions of the Arbitration Act and the Contract Act, 1872 and the consequential remedy available under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, i.e., to avail of right of civil action in a competent court of civil jurisdiction.	None
Nonetheless, the Act provides the additional remedy.	None
It would, therefore, be clear that the legislature intended to provide a remedy in addition to the consentient arbitration which could be enforced under the Arbitration Act or the civil action in a suit under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.	None
Thereby, as seen, Section 34 of the Act does not confer an automatic right nor create an automatic embargo on the exercise of the power by the judicial authority under the Act.	None
It is a matter of discretion.	None
Considered from this perspective, we hold that though the District Forum, State Commission and National Commission are judicial authorities, for the purpose of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, in view of the object of the Act and by operation of Section 3 thereof, we are of the considered view that it would be appropriate that these forums created under the Act are at liberty to proceed with the matters in accordance with the provisions of the Act rather than relegating the parties to an arbitration proceedings pursuant to a contract entered into between the parties.	None
The reason is that the Act intends to relieve the consumers of the cumbersome arbitration proceedings or civil action unless the forums on their own and on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case, come to the conclusion that the appropriate forum for adjudication of the disputes would be otherwise those given in the Act.	None
This Court had occasion to consider the provisions of Consumer Protection Act as well as the Arbitration Act, 1996.	None
In Skypak Couriers Ltd. v. Tata Chemicals, (2000) 5 SCC 294, this Court laid down the following Even if there exists an arbitration clause in an agreement and a complaint is made by the consumer, in relation to a certain deficiency of service, then the existence of an arbitration clause will not be a bar to the entertainment of the complaint by the Redressal Agency, constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, since the remedy provided under the Act is in addition to the provisions of any other law for the time being in force.	None
Another judgment which is relevant for the present issue is National Seeds Corporation Limited vs. M. Madhusudhan Reddy and another, (2012) 2 SCC 506.	None
In the above case, the respondent filed a complaint in the District Consumer Redressal Forum that they had suffered loss due to failure of the crops less yield because the seeds sold supplied by the appellant were defective.	None
The compensation was awarded against which appeal was dismissed.	None
The appellant challenged the order of the Commission and main contention was that the District Forum has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint, in view of the provisions of Seeds Act, 1966 it was contended that there was arbitration clause contained in the agreement and the only remedy available to the respondent is an appropriate arbitration and the District Forum has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint.	None
This Court repelled the submission and dismissed the appeal.	None
In paragraph 64 this Court had noticed the contention of the appellant which is to the following effect According to the learned counsel for the appellant, if the growers had applied for arbitration then in terms of Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act the dispute arising out of the arbitration clause had to be referred to an appropriate arbitrator and the District Consumer Forums were not entitled to entertain their complaint.	None
This contention represents an extension of the main objection of the appellant that the only remedy available to the farmers and growers who claim to have suffered loss on account of use of defective seeds sold supplied by the appellant was to file complaints with the Seed Inspectors concerned for taking action under Sections 19 and or 21 of the Seeds Act.	None
The contention was dealt with in paragraph 66 where following was laid down The remedy of arbitration is not the only remedy available to a grower.	None
Rather, it is an optional remedy.	None
He can either seek reference to an arbitrator or file a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act.	None
If the grower opts for the remedy of arbitration, then it may be possible to say that he cannot, subsequently, file complaint under the Consumer Protection Act.	None
However, if he chooses to file a complaint in the first instance before the competent Consumer Forum, then he cannot be denied relief by invoking Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.	None
Moreover, the plain language of Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act makes it clear that the remedy available in that Act is in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force.	None
Another judgment where this Court reiterated the position of law is Rosedale Developers Private Limited Vs Aghore Bhattacharya And Others, (2018) 11 SCC 337 (decided on 06.09.2013).	None
In the above case, a complaint was filed by the respondent before NCDRC.	None
An application was filed by the appellant praying for making reference to the arbitrator in view of the arbitration agreement.	None
The issue has been noticed in paragraphs 1 and 2 which are to the following effect 1.	None
Delay condoned.	None
This appeal filed against order dated 1352013 ( 2013 SCC OnLine Ncdrc 486, DLF Ltd. v. Mridul Estate (P) Ltd.338b) passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short the National Commission) whereby the appellants prayer for making a reference to the arbitrator was rejected can appropriately be termed as a frivolous piece of litigation which merits nothing but dismissal at the threshold with exemplary costs.	None
The respondents filed complaint alleging deficiency in service on the appellants part and claimed compensation to the tune of Rs 17,41,09,000 with costs of Rs 1,00,000.	None
On being noticed by the National Commission, the appellant filed a written statement to contest the complaint.	None
It also filed an application under Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short the 1996 Act) for making a reference to the arbitrator.	Facts
A twomember Bench of the National Commission referred the matter to the larger Bench.	None
After considering the relevant statutory provisions and adverting to several judgments including the judgments in Fair Air Engineers (P) Ltd. v. N.K. Modi Skypak Couriers Ltd. v. Tata Chemicals Ltd. and National Seeds Corpn.	None
Ltd. v. M. Madhusudhan Reddy, the larger Bench of the National Commission held that the consumer forums constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short the 1986 Act) are not bound to refer the dispute raised in the complaint to an Arbitral Tribunal in terms of the arbitration clause contained in the agreement entered into between the parties.	None
The contention was raised before this Court that once an application under Section 8 of 1996 Act is filed, Consumer Forum is dutybound to make a reference to the arbitrator.	None
The above submission was noticed in paragraph 3 which is to the following effect Shri Sanjay Ghose, learned counsel for the appellant relied upon the judgment of the Constitution Bench in SBP Co. v. Patel Engg.	None
Ltd. as also the judgments in Agri Gold Exims Ltd. v. Sri Lakshmi Knits and Wovens and Magma Leasing and Finance Ltd. v. Potluri Madhavilata	None
and argued that once an application is filed under Section 8 of the 1996 Act, the consumer forum is dutybound to make a reference to the arbitrator because that section is mandatory in character.	None
This Court rejected the above submission and laid down in paragraph 4 In our opinion, there is no merit in the submission of the learned counsel.	None
The question whether the existence of an arbitration clause contained in the agreement executed between the parties excludes the jurisdiction of the consumer forum and on an application made by either party, the consumer forum is dutybound to make a reference to the arbitrator was extensively considered in National Seeds Corpn.	None
Ltd. v. M. Madhusudhan Reddy	None
and it was observed (SCC pp.	None
53435, paras 6466.)	None
This Court held that there is no merit in the above submission of the counsel.	None
This Court referred to judgments of this Court in National Seeds Corporation Ltd. (supra) and Fair Air Engineers Pvt. Ltd.(supra) and laid down following in paragraph 6 and 7 The judgments relied upon by Shri Ghose do not have any bearing on the issue raised in this appeal.	None
In neither of those cases, has this Court interpreted the provisions of the 1996 Act in the light of the provisions contained in the 1986 Act.	None
Therefore, the propositions laid down in those judgments that Section 8 of the 1996 Act is mandatory cannot lead to an inference that the consumer forum is bound to make a reference to the Arbitral Tribunal.	None
In view of the abovestated legal position, the National Commission did not commit any error by holding that the remedy of arbitration available to the complainant does not bar the jurisdiction of the consumer forums and the consumer forums are not under an obligation to refer the matter to the Arbitral Tribunal.	None
With the above observation, the appeal is dismissed.	None
This Court in the series of judgments as noticed above considered the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as well as Arbitration Act, 1996 and laid down that complaint under Consumer Protection Act being a special remedy, despite there being an arbitration agreement the proceedings before Consumer Forum have to go on and no error committed by Consumer Forum on rejecting the application.	Reasoning
There is reason for not interjecting proceedings under Consumer Protection Act on the strength an arbitration agreement by Act, 1996.	Reasoning
The remedy under Consumer Protection Act is a remedy provided to a consumer when there is a defect in any goods or services.	Reasoning
The complaint means any allegation in writing made by a complainant has also been explained in Section 2(c) of the Act.	Reasoning
The remedy under the Consumer Protection Act is confined to complaint by consumer as defined under the Act for defect or deficiencies caused by a service provider, the cheap and a quick remedy has been provided to the consumer which is the object and purpose of the Act as noticed above.	Reasoning
Not only the proceedings of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 are special proceedings which were required to be continued under the Act despite an arbitration agreement, there are large number of other fields where an arbitration agreement can neither stop or stultify the proceedings.	Reasoning
For example, any action of a party, omission or commission of a person which amounts to an offence has to be examined by a criminal court and no amount of agreement between the parties shall be relevant for the said case.	Reasoning
For example, there may be a commercial agreement between two parties that all issues pertaining to transaction are to be decided by arbitration as per arbitration clause in the agreement.	Reasoning
In case where a cheque is dishonoured by one party in transaction, despite the arbitration agreement party aggrieved has to approach the criminal court.	Reasoning
Similarly, there are several issues which are non arbitrable.	Reasoning
There can be prohibition both express or implied for not deciding a dispute on the basis of an arbitration agreement.	Reasoning
This Court had occasion to consider the above aspect and has noticed various disputes which are nonarbitrable, reference is made to the judgment of this Court in Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. vs. SBI Home Finance Limited and others, (2011) 5 SCC 532.	None
In paragraphs 35 to 38 following has been laid down The Arbitral Tribunals are private fora chosen voluntarily by the parties to the dispute, to adjudicate their disputes in place of courts and tribunals which are public fora constituted under the laws of the country.	Reasoning
Every civil or commercial dispute, either contractual or noncontractual, which can be decided by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated and resolved by arbitration unless the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunals is excluded either expressly or by necessary implication.	Reasoning
Adjudication of certain categories of proceedings are reserved by the legislature exclusively for public fora as a matter of public policy.	Reasoning
Certain other categories of cases, though not expressly reserved for adjudication by public fora (courts and tribunals), may by necessary implication stand excluded from the purview of private fora.	Reasoning
Consequently, where the cause dispute is inarbitrable, the court where a suit is pending, will refuse to refer the parties to arbitration, under Section 8 of the Act, even if the parties might have agreed upon arbitration as the forum for settlement of such disputes.	None
The wellrecognised examples of non arbitrable disputes are (i) disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody (iii) guardianship matters (iv) insolvency and windingup matters (v) testamentary matters (grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate) and (vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or decide the disputes.	None
It may be noticed that the cases referred to above relate to actions in rem.	Reasoning
A right in rem is a right exercisable against the world at large, as contrasted from a right in personam which is an interest protected solely against specific individuals.	Reasoning
Actions in personam refer to actions determining the rights and interests of the parties themselves in the subjectmatter of the case, whereas actions in rem refer to actions determining the title to property and the rights of the parties, not merely among themselves but also against all persons at any time claiming an interest in that property.	Reasoning
Correspondingly, a judgment in personam refers to a judgment against a person as distinguished from a judgment against a thing, right or status and a judgment in rem refers to a judgment that determines the status or condition of property which operates directly on the property itself.	Reasoning
(Vide Blacks Law Dictionary.)	Reasoning
Generally and traditionally all disputes relating to rights in personam are considered to be amenable to arbitration and all disputes relating to rights in rem are required to be adjudicated by courts and public tribunals, being unsuited for private arbitration.	Reasoning
This is not however a rigid or inflexible rule.	Reasoning
Disputes relating to subordinate rights in personam arising from rights in rem have always been considered to be arbitrable.	Reasoning
The complaints filed under the Consumer Protection Act can also be proceeded with despite there being any arbitration agreement between the parties which have been well settled by the catena of decisions as noticed above.	Reasoning
Now, the issue to be addressed is effect and consequences of the above stated position of law consequent to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 amending Section 8.	Issue
Section 8(1) and 8(2) of Act, 1996 (as existed prior to amendment of the Act, 1996) are as follows Power to refer parties to arbitration where there is an arbitration agreement.	None
(1) A judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so applies not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration.	Issue
(2) The application referred to in sub section (1) shall not be entertained unless it is accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or a duly certified copy thereof.	Issue
Section 8(1) and 8(2)	None
after Amendment by Act, 2015 are as follows Section 8(1)	None
A judicial authority, before which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party to the arbitration agreement or any person claiming through or under him, so applies not later than the date of submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, then, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists.	Issue
(2) the following proviso shall be inserted, namely Provided that where the original arbitration agreement or a certified copy thereof is not available with the party applying for reference to arbitration under subsection (1), and the said agreement or certified copy is retained by the other party to that agreement, then, the party so applying shall file such application along with a copy of the arbitration agreement and a petition praying the Court to call upon the other party to produce the original arbitration agreement or its duly certified copy before that Court. .	Issue
Two more provisions of the 1996 Act need to be noted before we proceed further to consider the issues.	None
The 1996 Act contains two Parts Part I and Part II.	None
Part I contains heading Arbitration and Part II contains heading Enforcement of certain Foreign Awards.	None
Chapter I of Part	None
I is General Provisions, in which Section 2 deals with definitions.	None
Section 2(1) begins with the words In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires.	None
Section 2(1) contains definitions.	None
Section 2(3) provides Section 2(3)	None
This Part shall not affect any other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration.	None
There are two aspects to be noticed in the Scheme of Section 2, firstly, Section 2 contains a heading Definitions but it is covered by general heading of Chapter I General Provisions.	None
Section 2(3) does not contain any definition but contain a general provision which clarifies that This Part shall not affect any other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration .	None
Section 2(3) gives predominance of any other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration.	None
We have already noted several categories of cases, which are not arbitrable.	Reasoning
While referring to judgment of this Court in Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. (supra), those principles have again been reiterated by this Court in A. Ayyasamy (supra), Dr. A.K. Sikri, J. delivering the judgment in that case has noticed certain cases, which are not arbitrable in paragraph No.14, which is as follows In the instant case, there is no dispute about the arbitration agreement inasmuch as there is a specific arbitration clause in the partnership deed.	Reasoning
However, the question is as to whether the dispute raised by the respondent in the suit is incapable of settlement through arbitration.	Reasoning
As pointed out above, the Act does not make any provision excluding any category of disputes treating them as nonarbitrable.	None
Notwithstanding the above, the courts have held that certain kinds of disputes may not be capable of adjudication through the means of arbitration.	None
The courts have held that certain disputes like criminal offences of a public nature, disputes arising out of illegal agreements and disputes relating to status, such as divorce, cannot be referred to arbitration.	None
The following categories of disputes are generally treated as non arbitrable (i) patent, trade marks and copyright (ii) antitrust competition laws (iii) insolvency winding up (iv) bribery corruption (v) fraud (vi) criminal matters.	None
Fraud is one such category spelled out by the decisions of this Court where disputes would be considered as nonarbitrable.	None
Dr. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, J. in his concurring opinion has referred to Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. (supra) and noticed the categories of cases, which are not arbitrable.	Reasoning
Paragraph No. 35 of the judgment is quoted as below 35.	None
Ordinarily every civil or commercial dispute whether based on contract or otherwise which is capable of being decided by a civil court is in principle capable of being adjudicated upon and resolved by arbitration subject to the dispute being governed by the arbitration agreement unless the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal is excluded either expressly or by necessary implication.	Reasoning
In Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd., this Court held that (at SCC p. 546, para 35) adjudication of certain categories of proceedings is reserved by the legislature exclusively for public fora as a matter of public policy.	Reasoning
Certain other categories of cases, though not exclusively reserved for adjudication by courts and tribunals may by necessary implication stand excluded from the purview of private fora.	Reasoning
This Court set down certain examples of nonarbitrable disputes such as (SCC pp. 54647, para 36) (i) disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of criminal offences (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial separation, restitution of conjugal rights and child custody (iii) matters of guardianship (iv) insolvency and winding up (v) testamentary matters, such as the grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificates and (vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where a tenant enjoys special protection against eviction and specific courts are conferred with the exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the dispute.	None
This Court held that this class of actions operates in rem, which is a right exercisable against the world at large as contrasted with a right in personam which is an interest protected against specified individuals.	None
All disputes relating to rights in personam are considered to be amenable to arbitration while rights in rem are required to be adjudicated by courts and public tribunals.	Reasoning
The enforcement of a mortgage has been held to be a right in rem for which proceedings in arbitration would not be maintainable.	Reasoning
In Vimal Kishor Shah v. Jayesh Dinesh Shah, (2016) 8 SCC 788 this Court added a seventh category of cases to the six nonarbitrable categories set out in Booz Allen, namely, disputes relating to trusts, trustees and beneficiaries arising out of a trust deed and the Trust Act.	Reasoning
Another Section, which needs to be noted is Section 5, which is as follows Section 5.	None
Extent of judicial intervention.	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in this Part.	None
Section 5 contains an injunction to judicial authority from intervening except where so provided in this Part.	Reasoning
Section 2(3), Section 8, Section 11 and Section 34 are some of the provisions, which provides for judicial intervention in matters.	Reasoning
Here, we are concerned with power of judicial authority under Section 8, hence Section 5 is not much relevant in the present case.	Reasoning
Now, we come back to the interpretation of Section 8 as amended by Act No. 3 of 2016.	None
What is the legislative intent and object in bringing the amendment to Section 8 is the main question to be answered in this case.	None
Amendment under Section 8 has been undertaken by the Parliament after taking into consideration the 246 th Law Commission Report (2014).	None
Taking into consideration the working of the 1996 Act, there was an earlier attempt to carry out certain amendments in the 1996 Act.	None
176 th Report of the Law Commission on the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2001 was submitted by the Commission, although, the Government decided to accept the recommendations and introduced a bill namely Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2003, the bill was referred to Department relating Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice for a further analysis, which opined that many provisions of the bill were insufficient hence the bill was withdrawn.	None
The Ministry of Law and Justice issued a consultation paper and asked the Law Commission to take a study of the amendments proposed to the 1996 Act.	None
The Law Commission submitted 246 th Report Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in August, 2014.	None
The Commission in its Report has observed judicial intervention in arbitration proceedings adds significantly to the delays in the arbitration process and ultimately negates the benefits of arbitration .	None
Commission referring to amendments, which were recommended in Section 8 and 11 in paragraph	None
No. 33 stated following It is in this context, the Commission has recommended amendments to sections 8 and 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.	None
The scope of the judicial intervention is only restricted to situations where the Court Judicial Authority finds that the arbitration agreement does not exist or is null and void.	None
In so far as the nature of intervention is concerned, it is recommended that in the event the Court Judicial Authority is prima facie satisfied against the argument challenging the arbitration agreement, it shall appoint the arbitrator and or refer the parties to arbitration, as the case may be.	None
The amendment envisages that the judicial authority shall not refer the parties to arbitration only if it finds that there does not exist an arbitration agreement or that it is null and void.	None
If the judicial authority is of the opinion that prima facie the arbitration agreement exists, then it shall refer the dispute to arbitration, and leave the existence of the arbitration agreement to be finally determined by the arbitral tribunal.	None
However, if the judicial authority concludes that the agreement does not exist, then the conclusion will be final and not prima facie.	None
The Report of the Commission on amendment to Section 8 as well as Note thereon contains a Note, which is to the following effect NOTE	None
The words such of the parties to the arbitration agreement and proviso (i) of the amendment have been proposed in the context of the decision of the Supreme Court in Sukanya Holdings Pvt.	None
Ltd. v. Jayesh H. Pandya and Anr., (2003) 5 SCC 531 , in cases where all the parties to the dispute are not parties to the arbitration agreement, the reference is to be rejected only where such parties are necessary parties to the action and not if they are only proper parties, or are otherwise legal strangers to the action and have been added only to circumvent the arbitration agreement.	None
Proviso (ii) of the amendment contemplates a twostep process to be adopted by a judicial authority when considering an application seeking the reference of a pending action to arbitration.	None
The amendment envisages that the judicial authority shall not refer the parties to arbitration only if it finds that there does not exist an arbitration agreement or that it is null and void.	None
If the judicial authority is of the opinion that prima facie the arbitration agreement exists, then it shall refer the dispute to arbitration, and leave the existence of the arbitration agreement to be finally determined by the arbitral tribunal.	None
However, if the judicial authority concludes that the agreement does not exist, then the conclusion will be final and not prima facie.	None
The amendment also envisages that there shall be a conclusive determination as to whether the arbitration agreement is null and void.	None
(iii) In subsection (2), after the words duly certified copy thereof add or a copy accompanied by an affidavit calling upon the other party to produce the original arbitration agreement or duly certified copy thereof in a circumstance where the original arbitration agreement or duly certified copy is retained only by the other party.	Issue
NOTE	None
In many transactions involving Government bodies and smaller market players, the original duly certified copy of the arbitration agreement is only retained by the former.	None
This amendment would ensure that the latter class is not prejudiced in any manner by virtue of the same.	None
The Commission proposed amendment in Section 11 by adding subsection (6A).	None
In its Report, following Note was submitted in the above context NOTE	None
The proposed section 11 (6A) envisages the same process of determination as is reflected in the proposed amendment to section Explanation 2 envisages that reference by the High Court to any person or institution designated by it shall not be regarded as a delegation of judicial power.	None
Explanation 3 has been inserted with the hope and expectation that High Courts would encourage the parties to refer the disputes to institutionalize arbitration by a professional Indian or international arbitral institute.	None
After taking into consideration the Report of the Law Commission, a Bill namely The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 was submitted.	None
The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill throws considerable light on the Objects and Reasons of the amendments.	None
Relevant part of the Statement of Objects and Reasons is as follows The Act was enacted to provide for speedy disposal of cases relating to arbitration with least court intervention.	None
With the passage of time, some difficulties in the applicability of the Act have been noticed.	None
Interpretation of the provisions of the Act by courts in some cases have resulted in delay of disposal of arbitration proceedings and increase in interference of courts in arbitration matters, which tend to defeat the object of the Act 6.	None
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (iv) to provide that while considering any application for appointment of arbitrator, the High Court or the Supreme Court shall examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Notes on the Clauses on amendment in Section 8 reads as follows Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 8 of the principal Act to specify that the judicial authority shall refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exits.	None
A proviso below subsection (2) is inserted to provide that where the original arbitration agreement or certified copy thereof is not available with the party who apply under subsection (1), and is retained by the other party, such party shall file a copy of the arbitration agreement along with application under subsection (1) praying the Court to call upon the other party to produce the original arbitration agreement or its duly certified copy before the Court.	None
On amendment to Section 11 by inserting subsection (6A), following was stated Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to amend section 11 of the principal Act to provide that appointment of arbitrator shall be made by the Supreme Court or the High Court, as the case may be, instead of the Chief Justice of India or the Chief Justice of the High Court.	None
Subsection (6A) is inserted to provide that the Supreme Court or the High Court while considering application under subsection (4) to (6) shall confine to the examination of an arbitration agreement Prior to above amendment, this Court in several cases has interpreted Section 8.	None
Several conditions for exercising power under Section 8 were laid down by this Court.	None
In P. Anand Gajapathi Raju and Others Vs. P.V.G. Raju (Dead) and Others, (2000) 4 SCC 539 , several conditions were noticed by this Court, which are to be satisfied before Court can exercise its power under Section 8.	None
In paragraph No.5, following has been stated The conditions which are required to be satisfied under subsections (1) and (2) of Section 8 before the court can exercise its powers are (1) there is an arbitration agreement (2) a party to the agreement brings an action in the court against the other party (3) subjectmatter of the action is the same as the subjectmatter of the arbitration agreement (4) the other party moves the court for referring the parties to arbitration before it submits his first statement on the substance of the dispute.	None
Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx In Paragraph No. 8 of the judgment, it was further stated that the language of Section 8 is peremptory and it is, therefore, obligatory for the Court to refer the parties to arbitration in terms of their arbitration agreement.	None
In Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd.	None
Vs.	None
Jayesh H. Pandya and Another, (2003) 5 SCC 531 , this Court had occasion to consider the ingredients of Section 8.	None
This Court noticed certain circumstances, where matter was not required to be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal.	None
In Paragraph No. 12, 13 and 15, following has been held 12.	None
Further, the matter is not required to be referred to the Arbitral Tribunal, if (1) the parties to the arbitration agreement have not filed any such application for referring the dispute to the arbitrator (2) in a pending suit, such application is not filed before submitting first statement on the substance of the dispute or (3) such application is not accompanied by the original arbitration agreement or duly certified copy thereof	None
Secondly, there is no provision in the Act that when the subjectmatter of the suit includes subjectmatter of the arbitration agreement as well as other disputes, the matter is required to be referred to arbitration.	None
There is also no provision for splitting the cause or parties and referring the subject matter of the suit to the arbitrators.	None
The relevant language used in Section 8 is in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement .	None
The court is required to refer the parties to arbitration.	None
Therefore, the suit should be in respect of a matter which the parties have agreed to refer and which comes within the ambit of arbitration agreement.	None
Where, however, a suit is commenced as to a matter which lies outside the arbitration agreement and is also between some of the parties who are not parties to the arbitration agreement, there is no question of application of Section 8.	None
The words a matter indicate that the entire subjectmatter of the suit should be subject to arbitration agreement.	None
Court further held that Section 8 does not admit interpretation to partly referring the disputes to arbitration.	None
In Paragraph No.16, following was laid down The next question which requires consideration is even if there is no provision for partly referring the dispute to arbitration, whether such a course is possible under Section 8 of the Act.	None
In our view, it would be difficult to give an interpretation to Section 8 under which bifurcation of the cause of action, that is to say, the subject matter of the suit or in some cases bifurcation of the suit between parties who are parties to the arbitration agreement and others is possible.	None
This would be laying down a totally new procedure not contemplated under the Act.	None
If bifurcation of the subjectmatter of a suit was contemplated, the legislature would have used appropriate language to permit such a course.	None
Since there is no such indication in the language, it follows that bifurcation of the subjectmatter of an action brought before a judicial authority is not allowed.	None
The law as declared by this Court in the above cases was in existence when the Law Commission submitted its 246 th Report and Parliament considered the Bill, 2015 for Amendment Act, 2016.	Reasoning
The Law Commission itself in its Report has referred to amendment in Section 8 in context of decision of this Court in Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. (supra), which was clearly noticed in the Note to Section 8 as extracted above.	Reasoning
The words notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court added by amendment in Section 8 were with intent to minimise the intervention of judicial authority in context of arbitration agreement.	Reasoning
As per the amended Section 8(1), the judicial authority has only to consider the question whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement?	Reasoning
The Court cannot refuse to refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists .	Reasoning
The amended provision, thus, limits the intervention by judicial authority to only one aspect, i.e. refusal by judicial authority to refer is confined to only one aspect, when it finds that prima facie no valid arbitration agreement exists.	Reasoning
Other several conditions, which were noticed by this court in various pronouncements made prior to amendment were not to be adhered to and the Legislative intendment was clear departure from fulfilling various conditions as noticed in the judgment of P. Anand Gajapathi Raju (supra) and	Reasoning
Sukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. (supra).	None
Same Legislative intendment is decipherable by amendment of Section 11 by adding subsection (6A).	None
Section 11(6A) is as follows Appointment of arbitrators.	None
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (6A)	None
The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under subsection (4) or sub section (5) or subsection (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.	None
The same words notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court finds place in sub section (6A) of Section 11 and Supreme Court and High Court is confined to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.	None
This Court had occasion to consider the amendment made in Section 11(6A) in Duro Felguera, S.A. (supra).	None
Justice Kurian Joseph in his concurring opinion in Paragraph No. 48 has laid down following 48.	None
Section 11(6A) added by the 2015 Amendment, reads as follows 11.	None
(6A)	None
The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while considering any application under sub section (4) or subsection (5) or sub section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court, confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.	None
(emphasis supplied) From a reading of Section 11(6A), the intention of the legislature is crystal clear i.e. the court should and need only look into one aspectthe existence of an arbitration agreement.	None
What are the factors for deciding as to whether there is an arbitration agreement is the next question.	None
The resolution to that is simpleit needs to be seen if the agreement contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement.	None
Section 8 of the 1996 Act as amended also came for consideration in Ameet Lalchand Shah and Others Vs.	None
Rishabh Enterprises and Another, AIR 2018 SC 3041 (2018) 6 SCALE 621 2018 SCC Online SC 487.	None
This Court noticed the object and purpose of amended Section 8.	None
In Paragraph No. 29 to 31, following has been laid down Principally four amendments to Section 8(1) have been introduced by the 2015 Amendments(i)	None
the relevant party that is entitled to apply seeking reference to arbitration has been clarified amplified to include persons claiming through or under such a party to the arbitration agreement (ii) scope of examination by the judicial authority is restricted to a finding whether no valid arbitration agreement exists and the nature of examination by the judicial authority is clarified to be on a prima facie basis (iii) the cutoff date by which an application Under Section 8 is to be presented has been defined to mean the date of submitting the first statement on the substance of the dispute and (iv) the amendments are expressed to apply notwithstanding any prior judicial precedent.	None
The proviso to Section 8(2) has been added to allow a party that does not possess the original or certified copy of the arbitration agreement on account of it being retained by the other party, to nevertheless apply under Section 8 seeking reference, and call upon the other party to produce the same.	None
(Ref Justice R.S. Bachawats Law of Arbitration and Conciliation, Sixth Edition, Vol.	None
I (Sections 1 to 34) at page 695 published by LexisNexis).	None
The language of amendment to Section 8 of the Act is clear that the amendment to Section 8(1) of the Act would apply notwithstanding any prayer, judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any other Court.	None
The High Court laid emphasis upon the word unless it finds that primafacie no valid agreement exists.	None
The High Court observed that there is no arbitration agreement between Astonfield and Rishabh.	None
After referring to Sukanya Holdings and the amended Section 8 and Section 45 of the Act, the High Court pointed out the difference in language of Section 8 and Section 45 of the Act.	None
The High Court distinguished between Sukanya Holdings and Chloro Controls, and observed that Sukanya Holdings was not overruled by Chloro Controls.	None
This Court, thus, in the above cases has noticed that amendments are expressed to apply notwithstanding any prior judicial precedents, but the scope of amendment under Section 8(1) was confined to three categories as has been noted in Paragraph No.29.	Reasoning
Amendments under Section 8, thus, were aimed to minimise the scope of judicial authority to refuse reference to arbitration and only ground on which reference could have been refused was that it prima facie finds that no valid arbitration agreement exists.	Reasoning
Notwithstanding any prior judicial precedents referred to under Section 8(1) relates to those judicial precedents, which explained the discretion and power of judicial authority to examine various aspects while exercising power under Section 8.	Reasoning
The Legislative intent and object were confined to only above aspects and was not on those aspects, where certain disputes were not required to be referred to arbitration.	Reasoning
Can it be said that after amendment under Section 8(1), the law laid down by this Court in reference to Section 2(3), where large number of categories have been held to be nonarbitrable has been reversed or set at naught.	Reasoning
Neither any such Legislature intendment was there nor any such consequence was contemplated that law laid down by this Court in context of Section 2(3) has to be ignored or reversed.	Reasoning
While carrying out amendment under Section 8(1) of Act, 1996, the statutes providing additional remedies special remedies were not in contemplation.	Reasoning
The legislative intent is clear that judicial authoritys discretion to refuse arbitration was minimise in respect of jurisdiction exercise by judicial authority in reference to Section 8.	Reasoning
The amendment was also aimed to do away with special or additional remedies is not decipherable from any material.	Reasoning
The Law Commission 246 th Report, the Statement and Objects of Bill and the notes on clauses do not indicate that amendments were made for overriding special additional remedies provided under different statutes.	Reasoning
In the event, the interpretation as put by the learned counsel for the petitioner is accepted, Section 8 has to be read to override the law laid down by this Court in reference to various special additional jurisdictions as has been adverted to and noted in judgment of this Court in Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc.(supra) which was never the intent of amendment in Section 8.	Reasoning
The amendment in Section 8 cannot be given such expansive meaning and intent so as to inundate entire regime of special legislations where such disputes were held to be not arbitrable.	Reasoning
Something which legislation never intended cannot be accepted as side wind to override the settled law.	Reasoning
The submission of the petitioner that after the amendment the law as laid down by this Court in National Seeds Corporation Limited(supra) is no more a good law cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
The words notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any Court were meant only to those precedents where it was laid down that the judicial authority while making reference under Section 8 shall entitle to look into various facets of the arbitration agreement, subject matter of the arbitration whether the claim is alive or dead, whether the arbitration agreement is null and void.	Reasoning
The words added in Section 8 cannot be meant for any other meaning.	Reasoning
Reference is also made to the judgment of this Court in Vimal Kishor Shah and others vs. Jayesh Dinesh Shah and others, (2016) 8 SCC 788.	Reasoning
This Court in the above case had occasion to consider the provisions of Section 8 of the Act, 1996 in reference to special remedy provided under Trusts Act, 1882.	Reasoning
This Court noticed the judgment of this Court in Booz Allen and Hamilton Inc.(supra) with approval in paragraphs 40 and 42 which is to the following effect 40.	Reasoning
Before we examine the scheme of the Trusts Act, 1882, we consider it apposite to take note of the case law, which has a bearing on this issue.	Reasoning
The question came up for consideration before this Court in Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd. as to what is the meaning of the term arbitrability and secondly, which type of disputes are capable of settlement by arbitration under the Act.	Reasoning
Their Lordships framed three questions to answer the question viz.	Reasoning
(SCC p. 546, para 34) (1) Whether the disputes having regard to their nature could be resolved by a private forum chosen by the parties (Arbitral Tribunal) or whether such disputes exclusively fall within the domain of public fora (courts)?	Reasoning
(2) Whether the disputes are covered by the arbitration agreement?	None
and (3) Whether the parties have referred the disputes to arbitrator?	Reasoning
The question to be considered in this appeal is whether the disputes relating to affairs and management of the Trust including the disputes arising inter se trustees, beneficiaries in relation to their appointment, powers, duties, obligations, removal, etc. are capable of being settled through arbitration by taking recourse to the provisions of the Act, if there is a clause in the trust deed to that effect or such disputes have to be decided under the Trusts Act, 1882 with the aid of forum prescribed under the said Act?	Reasoning
After noticing the issues which have arisen in the above case this Court laid down following in paragraphs 51 and 53 51.	Reasoning
The principle of interpretation that where a specific remedy is given, it thereby deprives the person who insists upon a remedy of any other form of remedy than that given by the statute, is one which is very familiar, and which runs through the law, was adopted by this Court in Premier Automobiles Ltd. v. Kamlekar Shantaram Wadke while examining the question of bar in filing civil suit in the context of remedies provided under the Industrial Disputes Act (see G.P. Singh, Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 12th Edn., pp.	Reasoning
763 64).	None
We apply this principle here because, as held above, the Trusts Act, 1882 creates an obligation and further specifies the rights and duties of the settlor, trustees and the beneficiaries apart from several conditions specified in the trust deed and further provides a specific remedy for its enforcement by filing applications in civil court.	Reasoning
It is for this reason, we are of the view that since sufficient and adequate remedy is provided under the Trusts Act, 1882 for deciding the disputes in relation to trust deed, trustees and beneficiaries, the remedy provided under the Arbitration Act for deciding such disputes is barred by implication.	Reasoning
We, accordingly, hold that the disputes relating to trust, trustees and beneficiaries arising out of the trust deed and the Trusts Act, 1882 are not capable of being decided by the arbitrator despite existence of arbitration agreement to that effect between the parties.	Reasoning
A fortiori, we hold that the application filed by the respondents under Section 11 of the Act is not maintainable on the ground that firstly, it is not based on an arbitration agreement within the meaning of Sections 2(1)(b) and 2(1)(h) read with Section 7 of the Act and secondly, assuming that there exists an arbitration agreement (Clause 20 of the trust deed) yet the disputes specified therein are not capable of being referred to private arbitration for their adjudication on merits.	Reasoning
This Court held that disputes within the trust, trustees and beneficiaries are not capable of being decided by the arbitrator despite existence of arbitration agreement to that effect between the parties.	Reasoning
This Court held that the remedy provided under the Arbitration Act for deciding such disputes is barred by implication.	Reasoning
The ratio laid down in the above case is fully applicable with regard to disputes raised in consumer fora.	Reasoning
We may, however, hasten to add that in the event a person entitled to seek an additional special remedy provided under the statutes does not opt for the additional special remedy and he is a party to an arbitration agreement, there is no inhibition in disputes being proceeded in arbitration.	Decision
It is only the case where specific special remedies are provided for and which are opted by an aggrieved person that judicial authority can refuse to relegate the parties to the arbitration.	Decision
We, thus, do not find that any error has been committed by the NCDRC in rejecting the application filed by the appellant under Section 8.	Decision
No exception can be taken to the dismissal of the appeals by this Court against the judgment of NCDRC.	Decision
No ground is made out to review the order dated 13.02.2018.	Decision
The review petitions are dismissed.	Decision
