Ms. Rachna Joshi Issar, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit(i)	Arguments of Petitioner
No issue having been framed despite a specific plea having been raised by the appellant that he had not been driving the tractor, the Tribunal and consequently the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment.(ii)	Arguments of Petitioner
Appellant at the relevant time must be held to have been holding an effective licence as he had been granted a learners licence earlier, the finding of the Tribunal and consequently the High Court exonerating the Insurance Company from its liability to reimburse the owner in respect of the awarded amount suffers from serious legal infirmity.(iii)	Arguments of Petitioner
Having regard to the statutory duties imposed upon the Insurance Company to reimburse the owner of the vehicle or driver as provided for in Section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the impugned judgment must be held to be unsustainable.(iv)	Arguments of Petitioner
The Insurance Company having not proved breaches of conditions of contract of insurance as has been held by this Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v.

Arguments of Respondent
Appellant indisputably is the owner of the vehicle in question.	Issue
He was admittedly in the vehicle when it met with the accident.	Issue
A First Information Report was lodged against him.	Issue
He was proceeded against in a criminal trial having been chargesheeted by the Investigating Agency.	Issue
It is also not in dispute that the vehicle was insured.	None
The relevant portion of the Contract of Insurance reads as under Persons of classes of persons entitled to drive(A)	None
Any person including insured.	None
(B) PROVIDED that a person driving hold an effective driving Licence at the time of the accident and is not disqualified from holding or obtaining such a licence.	None
(C) PROVIDED also that the person holding an effective learners licence may also drive the vehicle and such a person satisfies the requirement of the Rule 3 of the Central Motor Vehicle Rule 1988.	None
Limitations as to useAgri.	None
Use.	None
Concededly the appellant had been holding a learners licence.	None
It expired on 22.12.2000.	None
The accident took place on 5.1.2001.	None
He applied for grant of a regular licence only on 22.1.2001, whereafter only the licence was granted to him.	None
Rule 14 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 provides for the manner in which an application for driving licence is to be filed.	None
Such an application is to be filed in Form 4 and is required to be inter alia accompanied by an effective learners licence to drive the vehicle of the type to which the application relates.	None
Different provisions in the Motor Vehicles Act as also rules framed thereunder exist for filing applications for grant of learners licence and a licence.	None
Whereas an application for grant of a learners licence is filed in form 3 prescribed by the rules an application for grant of licence is filed in Form 4.	None
The word effective licence is defined in Section 3 of the Act.	None
Sub Section 2 of Section 149, however, uses the word duly licensed.	None
In Swaran Singh (supra), a threeJudge Bench of this Court has drawn a distinction between the said two terms.	None
The Act provides for grant of a learners licence.	Reasoning
It indisputably is a licence within the meaning of provisions thereof.	Reasoning
A person holding a learners licence is also entitled to drive a vehicle but it is granted for a specific period.	Reasoning
The terms and conditions for grant of a learners licence are different from those of a regular licence.	Reasoning
Holding of a learners licence is imperative for filing an application for grant of licence as provided for in Rule 4 of the Rules.	Reasoning
Converse however is not true.	Reasoning
Only because the appellant held a learners licence which had expired and was not valid on the date of accident, he cannot be said to be duly licensed.	Reasoning
It is true that despite expiry of a regular licence, it may be renewed, but no provision has been brought to our notice providing for automatic renewal of learners licence.	Reasoning
In Ram Babu Tiwari v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd.	None
Ors., III (2008) ACC 776 (SC)VIII (2008)	None
SLT 167(2008) 8 SCC 165 , this Court held It is beyond any doubt or dispute that only in the event an application for renewal of licence is filed within a period 30 days from the date of expiry thereof, the same would be renewed automatically which means that even if an accident had taken place within the aforementioned period, the driver may be held to be possessing a valid licence.	None
The proviso appended to Subsection (1) of Section 15, however, clearly states that the driving licence shall be renewed with effect from the date of its renewal in the event the application for renewal of a licence is made more than 30 days after the date of its expiry.	None
It is, therefore, evident that as, on renewal of the licence on such terms, the driver of the vehicle cannot be said to be holding a valid licence, the insurer would not be liable to indemnify the insured.	None
Appellant herein raised a specific plea that he was not driving the vehicle and one Diwan Singh was driving the same.	None
The said fact was within his special knowledge.	None
Burden of proof, therefore, to prove the same was on him.	None
He did not examine Diwan Singh.	None
The claimants in their claim petition described the appellant as owner as well as driver of the vehicle.	None
The Insurance Company, as noticed hereinbefore, has also categorically raised the plea that the appellant was not holding a valid and effective licence.	None
The burden of proof ordinarily would be on Insurance Company to establish that there has been a breach of conditions of the contract of insurance.	None
In this case, however, the burden in terms of Section 106 of the Evidence Act was on the appellant.	None
He failed to discharge the said burden.	None
As indicated hereinbefore, not only a criminal case was pending against him, he was also chargesheeted.	None
A finding of fact has been arrived at that he had been driving the vehicle.	Reasoning
He in view of the pleadings raised by the Insurance Company cannot be said to have been prejudiced by nonframing of specific issue as to whether he was driving the vehicle or not.	Reasoning
He was aware of the pleadings of the parties.	Reasoning
He adduced evidence in that behalf.	Reasoning
The Tribunal as also the High Court arrived at a finding of fact that it was the appellant who had been driving the vehicle.18.	Reasoning
If that be so, the question raised before us must be determined having regard to the proved facts namely as on the date of accident he was not holding any valid and effective licence.19.	Reasoning
In terms of Section 149 of the Act, the Insurance Company would be liable to pay the awarded amount to the claimants provided the accident is covered by the terms of the policy, although the burden in respect thereof would be in the Insurance Company.20.	Reasoning
It is now well settled in view of Section 58 of the Indian Evidence Act that facts admitted need not to be proved.21.	Reasoning
The question as to whether the appellant was holding a valid licence or not was within his knowledge.	Reasoning
The driver was to show that he held licence in respect of the vehicle for which he had filed an application.	Reasoning
Filing of an application and grant thereof would therefore are prerequisite for holding a valid and effective licence.22.	Reasoning
As on 5.1.2001 the appellant was not duly licensed as his learners licence expired on 22.12.2000.	Reasoning
He filed an application for grant of licence much later.	Reasoning
Insurance Company, therefore, in our opinion was not bound to reimburse him in terms of the Contract of Insurance.23.	Reasoning
There is, thus, no merit in the case.	Decision
The appeal is dismissed.	Decision
However, in the facts and circumstances of this case, there shall be no order as to costs.	Decision
