It is admitted by the second respondents that bonus had been paid in accordance with the method contained in the agreement and the award, dated March 13, 1956 for the years 1953 and 1954.	Arguments of Respondent
There were disputes between the appellant and the second respondents with regard to the bonus to be paid for the years 1955 and 1956.	Arguments of Respondent
The dispute was referred to the arbitration of Sri M. D. Bhat.	Arguments of Respondent
The arbitrator gave his award on April 25, 1958.	Arguments of Respondent
After certain correspondence between the parties the award was filed with the Registrar, Industrial Court under S. 74(1) of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
As the appellant failed to carry out directions contained in the award the second respondents made an application to the Labour Court  Application No. 574 of 1958  contending that the appellant had committed an illegal change under the Act by not paying to their employees bonus as directed by the award, dated April 25, 1958 and prayed for an order that the appellant should be directed to withdraw the illegal change with immediate effect.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant denied its liability, but the Labour Court allowed the application of the second respondents by its order, dated August 4, 1959 and directed the appellant to withdraw the illegal change by complying with the directions contained in the award within one month from the date of the order.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant took the matter in appeal to the Industrial Court, being appeal No. 226 of 1959.	Arguments of Respondent

It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the notification of the State Government, dated July 31, 1956 under S. 114(2) of the Act was the subjectmatter of consideration in Prakash Cotton Mills (Private) Ltd. v. State of Bombay, (1962) 1	Arguments of Petitioner
SCR 105 (AIR 1961 SC 977 ), and it was held by this Court that the notification was ultra vires of the powers conferred on the State Government under S. 114(2) of the Act and must be struck down.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. S. T. Desai put forward the contention that the High Court should, therefore, have quashed the order of the Industrial Court by grant of a writ for an error of law apparent on the face of record.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. B. Sen on behalf of the respondents, however, said that the case of the appellant is different from that of Prakash Cotton Mills, (1962)	Arguments of Petitioner
1	Arguments of Petitioner
SCR 105 (AIR 1961 SC 977 ), supra, and the decision of this Court in that case does not govern this case.	Arguments of Petitioner
We are unable to accept the argument of the respondents as correct.	Reasoning
It was held by the majority judgment of this Court in Prakash Cotton Mills case, (1962) 1	Reasoning
SCR 105 (AIR 1961 SC 977 ), that the notification, dated July 31, 1956 was beyond the powers of the State Government under S. 114(2) of the Act, because there are three limitations on the State Governments power enacted under that subsection (1)It is limited by the subjectmatter of the agreement or settlement, submission or award sought to be extended, (2) it has to be in conformity with the Industrial Law laid down by the Full Bench of the Industrial Court and also by any decision of this Court, and (3) the State Governments power to make a direction under that section is coterminus with the power of an adjudicator and the State cannot do what an adjudicator cannot do under the Act.	Reasoning
At p. 112 of the Report, (SCR) (at p. 979 of AIR), Wanchoo, J., speaking for the Court stated as follows The contention on behalf of the appellant is that it would not be open to an Industrial Court to grant bonus when profit was not adequate to meet all prior charges or where there was an actual loss and, therefore, when the impugned notification made it possible for grant of bonus even in these cases (for prima facie the appellant had made losses upto 1955), it directed something which even an Industrial Court could not do.	Reasoning
In consequence, it is urged that the notification inasmuch as it makes this possible is beyond the powers conferred on the State Government under S. 114(2) because it allows something to be done which even an Industrial Court could not allow.	Reasoning
Reliance in this connection is placed on the decision of this Court in New Manekchowk Spinning Co. Ltd. v. Textile Labour Association, (1961) 3	Reasoning
SCR 1 (AIR 1961 SC 867 ).	Reasoning
In that case this Court was considering a similar agreement relating to Ahmedabad.	Reasoning
The Industrial Court had imposed that agreement after its expiry for one year on the mills in spite of their contention that they were not bound to pay any bonus for the years in dispute in view of the law laid down by this Court in The Associated Cement Companies Ltd. v. The Workmen, 1959 SCR 925 (AIR 1959 SC 967 ).	Reasoning
After examining the terms of the agreement then in dispute this Court came to the conclusion that in view of the law laid down in the Associated Cement Companies, case, the Industrial Court had no jurisdiction to impose that agreement on the mills.	Reasoning
It further held that an agreement of that kind could only continue by consent of parties and could not be enforced by industrial adjudication against the will of any of the parties.	Reasoning
The agreement in the present case directed to be enforced by the impugned notification is similar in terms and as held in The New Maneckchowks case, it could not be enforced by industrial adjudication against the will of any of the parties.	Reasoning
The power of the State Government under Section 114(2) being coterminus with the power of an adjudicator under the Act, such an agreement cannot therefore, be directed to be enforced against the will of the appellant even under S. 114(2) inasmuch as by doing so the State Government would be going beyond the powers conferred on it by that section.	Reasoning
The impugned notification, therefore, must be held to be bad inasmuch as it goes beyond the powers conferred on the State Government under S. 114(2) and must therefore, be struck down.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the present case falls directly within the ratio of the decision of this Court in Prakash Cotton Mills case (1962) 2	Reasoning
SCR 105 (AIR 1961 SC 977 ), and it follows, therefore, that the award of Mr. Bhat, dated April 25, 1958 is illegal and ultra vires and the decision of the Labour Court dated August 4, 1959 and of the Industrial Court, dated October 24, 1959 must be quashed by grant of a writ of certiorari.	Reasoning
6.	None
On behalf of the respondents Mr. B. Sen, however, pointed out that the conduct of the appellant does not entitle it to the grant of a writ, because it has been guilty of acquiescence or delay.	Arguments of Respondent
It was pointed out that the award of Mr. Bhat was given on April 25, 1958 but an application to the High Court for grant of a writ was made long after on November 16, 1959.	Arguments of Respondent
We do not think there is any substance in this argument, because the second respondents had made an application, dated August 19, 1958 to the Labour Court for enforcement of the award and the appellant had contested that application by a Written Statement, dated September 15, 1958.	None
The Labour Court allowed the application on August 4, 1959 and the appellant had preferred an appeal to the Industrial Court on August 31, 1959.	Reasoning
The decision of the Industrial Court was given on October 24, 1959 and after the appeal was dismissed the appellant moved the High Court for grant of a writ on November 16, 1959.	None
Mr. B. Sen then put forward the argument that the appellant itself had acted on the bonus agreement and on October 14, 1957 had issued a notice informing its workers that pursuant to the award of the Industrial Court in terms of the agreement, dated March l, 1956 reached between the Millowners Association, Bombay, and the Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, regarding payment of bonus would be paid to them at 4.8 per cent of the total basic earning during 1956.	Arguments of Respondent
On October 27, 1956 the appellant and the Secretary of the second respondents signed a joint statement in which it was stated as follows Since it has not yet been possible to complete bonus calculations for all these years, it is hereby agreed between the Rashtriya Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay, and the Moon Mills Ltd, Bombay, that under the Bonus Agreement the Moon Mills should pay a bonus at the rate of 4.8 per cent for each of the years 1953, 1954 and 1955 as a tentative payment.	Arguments of Respondent
It was, therefore, contended that the appellant itself had agreed with the second respondents to pay bonus for 1953, 1954, 1955 and 1956 according to the terms of the bonus agreement.	Arguments of Respondent
It was also pointed out that the appellant had not pressed its objection with regard to jurisdiction before the Labour Court or the Industrial Court.	Arguments of Respondent
But it appears that the decision of this Court in Prakash Cotton Mills case, (1962)	Reasoning
2	Reasoning
SCR 105 (AIR 1961 SC 977 ), was given on February 16, 1961 after the decision of K. K. Desai, J. on July 1, 1960 and before the decision of the Letters Patent Bench on February 6, 1962.	Reasoning
In the circumstances of this case, we do not consider that there is such acquiescence on the part of the appellant as to disentitle it to a grant of a writ under Art.	Reasoning
226 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
It is true that the issue of a writ of certiorari is largely a matter of sound discretion.	Reasoning
It is also true that the writ will not be granted if there is such negligence or omission on the part of the applicant to assert his right as, taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other circumstances, causes prejudice to the adverse party.	None
The principle is to a great extent, though not identical with, similar to the exercise of discretion in the Court of Chancery.	None
The principle has been clearly stated by Sir Barnes Peacock in Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Prosper Armstrong Hurd, Abram Farewell, and John Kemp, (1874) 5 PC 221 at p. 239, as follows Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of Equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine.	None
Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy, either because the party has, by his conduct, done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time and delay are most material.	Reasoning
But in every case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations, the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable.	Reasoning
Two circumstances, always important in such cases, are, the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval, which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other, so far as related to the remedy.	Reasoning
In the present case, we are of opinion that there is no such negligence or laches or acquiescence on the part of the appellant as may disentitle it to the grant of a writ.	Reasoning
7.	None
For the reasons already stated, we hold that the judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, dated February 6, 1962 must be set aside and the appellant must be granted a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the order of the Industrial Court, dated October 24, 1959 and of the Labour Court, dated August 4, 1959.	Decision
The appeal is accordingly allowed but in the circumstances of the case there will be no order as to costs.	Decision
8.	None
We should, however, like to make it clear that this decision will not prejudice the trial of any References with respect to bonus which may be pending, or which may hereafter be made between the appellant and its employees in respect of the years 1955 and 1956, if such References are pending or should thereafter be made they will be proceeded with and decided in accordance with law.	Decision
9.	None
Appeal allowed.	Decision
