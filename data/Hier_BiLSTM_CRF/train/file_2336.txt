The relevant provisions of the said Act are as under Directions by State Government	Facts
The State Government may issue to the Board such directions of a general nature as it may think necessary or expedient for the purpose of carrying out the purposes of this Act, and the Board shall be bound to follow and act upon such directions.	Facts

Facts
Submissions Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, the learned Addl.	None
Solicitor General and Mr. D.A. Dave, the learned senior counsel, appearing for the appellants would submit that the High Court committed a manifest error in passing the impugned judgment insofar as it entered into the question of validity or otherwise of the policy decision adopted by the State.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel would submit that the requirements of the Company for setting up its industrial units can be judged by the experts wherefor High Level Committee was constituted and, thus, the High Court could not sit in appeal thereover.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that the High Court further committed a manifest error by arriving at the conclusion that the State had shown undue haste in the matter of grant of allotment and that too at a price of Rs. 3,72,324/ per acre although it received the consideration of Rs. 8,00,000/ per acre from another entrepreneur.15.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel would further urge that the High Court has failed to consider that the writ petitioners had no locus standi to file the writ application as they had been set up by those whose lands had been acquired.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that whereas the lands were allotted on 7.4.1995, the writ petition having been filed on 11.11.1996 suffered from gross delay and laches and in that view of the matter too the High Court should have refused to exercise its jurisdiction in favour of the appellants particularly in view of the fact that the Company in the meantime have changed their position by investing about Rs. 80/ crores.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. T.L.V. Iyer, the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, would submit that the purported allotment was made in favour of the company by the Board without making any enquiry as regard the area of the land it actually needed not there had been any application of mind in relation thereto.	Arguments of Respondent
The property having been acquired under a statute is a public property, contends Mr. Iyer, and being trustees thereof, the Board was required to take extreme care and caution in relation thereto.	Arguments of Respondent
It was contended that the High Court had rightly found that for all intent and purport such vast tract of land had been sold to the Company although apparently allotted for a period of 11 years and thereafter the Company would be entitled to obtain sale deed in relation to the demised Land.	Arguments of Respondent
At the relevant time, Mr. Iyer argued, neither any project report had been submitted by the Company nor any material was placed to show that the Company required such vast tract of land.	Arguments of Respondent
Scope of the Public Interest Litigation.	Arguments of Respondent
The Company intended to set up more than one unit.	None
For the purpose of achieving the objective of economic development of the State, the State is entitled to deal with the applications of the entrepreneurs in an appropriate manner.	None
For the said purpose a High Level Committee was constituted.	Facts
The said Committee held its meeting on 10.10.1994 wherein not only the members referred to hereinbefore but also various other officers were present.	None
Presumably, prior thereto the applications filed by the Company were scrutinized by the competent authorities.	None
After detailed discussions, the High Level Committee resolved a) to permit the unit to change the location from Malur Indl.	None
Area.	None
to Dobespet Industrial Area b) to allot a total of 500 acres of land for the three projects viz., Colour Picture Tube, Colour Televisions and Battery, in Dobespet Industrial Area, Nelamangala to, in lieu of the earlier allotment of 100 acres of land at Malur Indl Area for the Colour TV sets project, subject to the promoters indicating the individual land requirement for Colour Picture Tube project, Colour TV project and the battery project duly justifying the requirement with necessary plans, block diagrams, etc.	None
As regard incentives, it was resolved INCENTIVES	None
The HLC resolved to offer the following incentives 100 exemption of sales tax (KST.	None
CST Turnover Tax) on sale of finished goods for a period of 8 years or deferment for a period of 10 years from the date of commencement of commercial production subject to a limit of 100 of the value of the fixed assets.	None
The present level of ST revenue from the company from TV manufacturing is to be maintained.	None
(ii) Exemption from payment of Purchase Tax (ST on purchase by the co.) on capital goods equipment worth more than Rs. 1.00 crore (Rupees one crores) in each individual case during the construction phase of the project.	None
Similar considerations were made in respect of Colour Television Picture Tube Project of the Company and Manufacture of Batteries.	None
The matter relating to allotment of land is a statutory function on the part of the Board.	None
In terms of the provisions of the Act, consultations with the State Government is required if Regulation 13 of the Regulations in place of Regulation 7 is to be taken recourse to.	None
Does it mean that consultations must be held in a particular manner, i.e. by exchange of correspondences and in no other?	None
Answer to the said questions must be rendered in negative.	None
The High Level Committee was chaired by the Minister who in terms of the Rules of Executive Business framed under Article 166 of the Constitution of India was entitled to represent the State.	None
Once a consultation takes place by mutual discussion and a consensus is arrived at between different authorities performing different functions under the statutes, the purpose for which consultation was to be made would stand satisfied.	None
Under the Act or the Regulations framed thereunder, no procedure for holding such consultations had been laid down.	None
In that situation it was open to the competent authorities to evolve their own procedure.	None
Such a procedure of taking a decision upon deliberations does not fall foul of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.	None
No malice of fact has been alleged in the instant case.	None
The High Court has proceeded to pronounce its judgment inter alia on the ground that the price of the land should have been fixed at Rs. 8,00,000/ per acre.	None
In the support of the said decision, the High Court has relied upon a grant at the aforementioned rate.	None
However, it was pointed out by the Board It is submitted that the land allotted to respondent No.4 was not fully developed by this petitioner except some infrastructural facilities which have been counted while calculating the price of the land.	None
The land allotted to individual entrepreneurs is fully developed with all infrastructural facilities.	None
There cannot be any equality between unequals.	None
The cost of the land is arrived at by this petitioner taking into consideration the cost of acquisition, cost of partial development, service and establishment charges.	None
This aspect of the matter did not receive due attention of the High Court despite its merit.	None
It is a wellsettled principle of law that different considerations arises for the purpose of fixation of price in respect of price of land i.e. for a small area visavis a large area.	Reasoning
The allotment price was Rs. 3,73,324/ per acre which, having regard to the policy decision of the State as also the facts and circumstances of the case cannot be said to be wholly arbitrary warranting interference by the Court.	Reasoning
There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that normally allotment of such industrial plots should be done in terms of Regulation 7 aforementioned.	Reasoning
But the same by itself did not preclude the authorities of the Board and the State having regard to the fact situation obtaining herein to take recourse to Regulation 13.	Reasoning
Once the Court finds that the power exercised by the statutory authorities can be traced to a provision of statute, unless and until violation of mandatory provisions thereof are found out and or it is held that a decision is taken for unauthorised or illegal purpose, the court will not ordinarily interfere either with the policy decision or any decision taken by the executive authorities pursuant to or in furtherance thereof.	Reasoning
Malice in common law or acceptance means ill will against a person, but in legal sense means a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse.	None
Case Laws Operating in the Field In G.B. Mahajan and others vs. Jalgaon Municipal Council and others (1991) 3 SCC 91 ), this Court stated While it is true that principles of judicial review apply to the exercise by a government body of its contractual powers, the inherent limitations on the scope of the inquiry are themselves a part of those principles.	None
For instance, in a matter even as between the parties, there must be shown a public law element to the contractual decision before judicial review is invoked.	None
In the present case the material placed before the court falls far short of what the law requires to justify interference.	None
In Tata Cellular vs. Union of India (1994) 6 SCC 651 ), the Court laid down the following principles in the matter of judicial review The principles deducible from the above are 1)	None
The modern trend points to judicial restraint in administrative action.	None
2)	None
The court does not sit as a court of appeal but merely reviews the manner in which the decision was made.	None
3)	None
The court does not have the expertise to correct the administrative decision.	None
If a review of the administrative decision is permitted it will be substituting its own decision, without the necessary expertise which itself may be fallible.	None
4) The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation to tender is in the realm of contract.	None
Normally speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the contract is reached by process of negotiations through several tiers.	None
More often than not, such decisions are made qualitatively by experts.	None
5)	None
The Government must have freedom of contract.	None
In other words, a fair play in the joints is a necessary concomitant for an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere or quasiadministrative sphere.	None
However, the decision must not only be tested by the application of Wednesbury principle of reasonableness (including its other facts pointed out above) but must be free from arbitrariness not affected by bias or actuated by mala fides.	None
(6) Quashing decisions may impose heavy administrative burden on the administration and lead to increased and unbudgeted expenditure.	None
In M.P. Oil Extraction and another vs. State of M.P. and others (1997) SCC 592), this Court observed The renewal clause in the impugned agreements executed in favour of the respondents does not also appear to be unjust or improper.	None
Whether protection by way of supply of sal seeds under the terms of agreement requires to be continued for a further period, is a matter for decision by the State Government and unless such decision is patently arbitrary, interference by the Court is not called for.	None
In the facts of the case, the decision of the State Government to extend the protection for further period cannot be held to be per se irrational, arbitrary or capricious warranting judicial review of such policy decision.	None
Therefore, the High Court has rightly rejected the appellants contention about the invalidity of the renewal clause.	None
The appellants failed in earlier attempts to challenge the validity of the agreement including the renewal clause.	None
The subsequent challenge of the renewal clause, therefore, should not be entertained unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the fact situation has undergone such changes that the discretion in the matter of renewal of agreement should not be exercised by the State.	None
It has been rightly contended by Dr. Singhvi that the respondents legitimately expect that the renewal clause should be given effect to in usual manner and according to past practice unless there is any special reason not to adhere to such practice.	None
The doctrine in legitimate expectation has been judicially recognised by this Court in a number of decisions.	None
The doctrine of legitimate expectation operates in the domain of public law and in an appropriate case, constitutes a substantive and enforceable right.	None
It was further pointed out Although to ensure fair play and transparency in State action, distribution of largesse by inviting open tenders or by public auction is desirable, it cannot be held that in no case distribution of such largesse by negotiation is permissible.	None
In the instant case, as a policy decision protective measure by entering into agreements with selected industrial units for assured supply of sal seeds at concessional rate has been taken by the Government.	None
The rate of royalty has also been fixed on some accepted principle of pricing formula as will be indicated hereafter.	None
Hence, distribution or allotment of sal seeds at the determined royalty to the respondents and other units covered by the agreements cannot be assailed.	None
It is to be appreciated that in this case, distribution by public auction or by open tender may not achieve the purpose of the policy of protective measure by way of supply of sal seeds at concessional rate of royalty to the industrial units covered by the agreements on being selected on valid and obejective considerations.	None
In Netai Bag and others vs. State of W.B. and others (2000) 8 SCC 262 ), Sethi J. speaking for the Bench observed Though the State cannot escape its liability to show its actions to be fair, reasonable and in accordance with law, yet wherever challenge is thrown to any of such action, initial burden of showing the prima facie existence of violation of the mandate of the Constitution lies upon the person approaching the court.	None
We have found in this case, that the appellants have miserably failed to place on record or to point out to any alleged constitutional vice or illegality.	None
Neither the High Court nor this Court would have ventured to make a rowing inquiry particularly in a writ petition filed at the instance of the erstwhile owners of the land, whose main object appeared to get the land back by any means as, admittedly, with the passage of time and development of the area, the value of the land had appreciated manifold.	None
It may be noticed that in the year 1961 the erstwhile owners were paid about Rs. 5.5 lakhs and the State Government assessed the market value of the property which was paid by Respondent 5 at Rs. 71,59,820.	None
The Appellants have themselves stated that the value of the land roundabout the time, when it was leased to Respondent 5 was about Rs. 11 crores.	None
There cannot be any dispute with the proposition that generally when any State land is intended to be transferred or the State largesse decided to be conferred, resort should be had to be public auction or transfer by way of inviting tenders from the people.	None
That would be a sure method of guaranteeing compliance with the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
Nonfloating of tenders or not holding of public auction would not in all cases be deemed to be the result of the exercise of the executive power in an arbitrary manner.	None
Making an exception to the general rule could be justified by the State executive, if challenged in appropriate proceedings.	None
The constitution courts cannot be expected to presume the alleged irregularities, illegalities or unconstitutionality nor the courts can substitute their opinion for the bona fide opinion of the State executive.	None
The courts are not concerned with the ultimate decision but only with the fairness of the decisionmaking process.	None
In the backdrop of the legal position noticed herein, it has to be seen, in the instant case, as to whether the action of Respondent 1 was illegal, arbitrary or mala fide.	None
To justify their action of entering into an agreement of lease by negotiation, even in the absence of pleadings on behalf of the appellants, the State has submitted that the entire transaction of granting the lease to Respondent 5 for an integrated food processing unit with an abattoir in a semirural area, which was a lowlying land, despite their best efforts, the State Government were unable to set up any project.	None
The lease was given to Respondent 5 upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances with the object of setting up an industry in the State of West Bengal which was likely to generate employment to more than 300 persons and earn foreign exchange worth more than Rs. 50 acrores.	None
The negotiations were resorted to ensure the disposal of the slaughterhouse at Durgapur which was proved to have been running in losses.	None
The respondent State had failed to get any buyer for Durgapur Project despite newspaper advertisement.	None
In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case we are not persuaded to hold that the action of the respondent State in executing the lease deed with Respondent 5 was unreasonable, illegal, arbitrary or actuated by extraneous considerations.	None
In this regard it is worth noticing that none except the erstwhile owners and the propounders of vegetarianism have made any grievance to the effect that the market value of the property, as charged from Respondent 5, was either allegedly for a song or at a throwaway price.	None
In Raunaq International Ltd. vs. I.V.R. Construction Ltd. and others (1999) 1 SCC 492 )	None
it was held When a writ petition is filed in the High Court challenging the award of a contract by a public authority or the State, the court must be satisfied that there is some element of public interest involved in entertaining such a petition.	None
If, for example the dispute is purely between two tenderers, the court must be vary careful to see if there is any element of public interest involved in the litigation.	None
A mere difference in the prices offered by the two tenderers may or may not be decisive in deciding whether any public interest is involved in intervening in such a commercial transaction.	None
It is important to bear in mind that by court intervention, the proposed project may be considerably delayed thus escalating the cost for more than any saying which the court would ultimately effect in public money by deciding the dispute in favour of one tenderer or the other tenderer.	None
Therefore, unless the court is satisfied that there is a substantial amount of public interest, or the transaction is entered into mala fide, the court should not intervene under Article 226 in disputes between two rival tenderers.12)	None
When a petition is filed as a public interest litigation challenging the award of a contract by the State or any public body to a particular tenderer, the court must satisfy itself that the party which has brought the litigation is litigating bona fide for public good.	None
The public interest litigation should not be merely a cloak for attaining private ends or a third party or of the party bringing the petition.	None
The court can examine the previous record of public service rendered by the organisation bringing public interest litigation.	None
Even when a public interest litigation is entertained, the court must be careful to weigh conflicting public interests before intervening.	None
Intervention by the court may ultimately result in delay in the execution of the project.	None
The obvious consequence of such delay is price escalation.	None
If any retendering is prescribed, cost of the project can escalate substantially.	None
What is more important is that ultimately the public would have to pay a much higher price is the form of delay in the commissioning of the project and the consequent delay in the contemplated public service becoming available to the public.	None
If it is a power project which is thus delayed, the public may lose substantially because of shortage in electricity supply and the consequent obstruction in industrial development.	None
If the project is for the construction of a road or an irrigation canal, the delay in transportation facility becoming available or the delay in water supply for agriculture being available, can be a substantial setback to the countrys economic development.	None
Where the decision has been taken bona fide and a choice has been exercised on legitimate considerations and not arbitrarily, there is no reason why the court should entertain a petition under Article 226.13)	None
Hence before entertaining a writ petition and passing any interim orders in such petitions, the court must carefully weigh conflicting public interests.	None
Only when it comes to a conclusion that there is an overwhelming public interest in entertaining the petition, the court should intervene.14) Where there is an allegation of mala fides or an allegation that the contract has been entered into for collateral purposes and the court is satisfied on the material before it that the allegation needs further examination, the court would be entitled to entertain the petition.	None
But even here, the court must weigh the consequences in balance before granting interim orders.	None
In Narmada Bachao Andolan vs. Union of India and others (2000) 10 SCC 664 ) this Court opined The project, in principle, was cleared more than 25 years ago when the foundation stone was laid by late Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru.	None
Thereafter, there was an agreement of the four Chief Ministers, in 1974, namely, the Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan for the project to be undertaken.	None
Then dispute arose with regard to the height of the dam which was settled with the award of the Tribunal being given in 1978.	None
For a number of years, thereafter, final clearance was still not given.	None
In the meantime some environmental studies were conducted.	None
The final clearance was not given because or the environmental concern which is quite evident.	None
Even though complete data which regard to the environment was not available, the Government did not 1987 finally give environmental clearance.	None
It is thereafter that the construction of the dam was undertaken and hundreds of crores have been unvested before the petitioner chose to file a writ petition in 1994 challenging the decision to construct the dam and the clearance as was given.	None
In our opinion, the petitioner which had been agitating against the dam since 1986 is guilty of laches in not approaching the Court at an earlier point of time.	None
In Balco Employees Union (Regd.)	None
vs. Union of India Another others (2002) 2 SCC 333 ), it was held Public interest litigation, or PIL as it is more commonly known, entered the Indian judicial process in 1970.	None
It will not be incorrect to say that it is primarily the judges who have innovated this type of litigation as there was a dire need for it.	None
At that stage, it was intended to vindicate public interest where fundamental and other rights of the people who were poor, ignorant or in socially or economically disadvantageous position and were unable to seek legal redress were required to be espoused.	None
PIL was not meant to be adversial in nature and was to be a cooperative and collaborative effort of the parties and the court so as to secure justice for the poor and the weaker sections of the community who were not in a position to protect their own interests.	None
Public interest litigation was intended to mean nothing more than what words themselves said viz.	None
litigation in the interest of the public.	Facts
While PIL initially was invoked mostly in cases connected with the relief to the people and the weaker sections of the society and in areas where there was violation of human rights under Article 21, but with the passage of time, petitions have been entertained in other spheres.	None
Prof. S.B. Sathe has summarised the extent of the jurisdiction which has now been exercised in the following words PIL may, therefore, be described as satisfying one or more of the following parameters.	None
These are not exclusive but merely descriptive.  	None
Where the concerns underlying a petition are not individualist but are shared widely by a large number of people (bonded labour, undertrial prisoners, prison inmates).  	None
Where the affected persons belong to the disadvantaged sections of society (women, children , bonded labour, unorganised labour etc.).  	None

Conclusions Salient principles of law as noticed hereinbefore, were not considered by the High Court in passing the impugned judgment.34.	Reasoning
In the facts and circumstances, we do not find that the Board and the State had committed any illegality which could have been a subject matter of judicial review.	Reasoning
The High Court in our opinion committed a manifest error insofar as it failed to take into consideration that the delay in this case had defeated equity.	Reasoning
The allotment was made in the year 1995.	Reasoning
The writ application was filed after one year.	Reasoning
By that time the Company had not only took possession of the land but also made sufficient investment.	Reasoning
Delay of this nature shall have been considered by the High Court to be of vital importance.35.	Reasoning
Furthermore, the High Court ought to have taken into consideration the factum of resistance in the matter from those persons whose lands have been acquired.	Reasoning
Only because the lands are vested in the State upon acquisition thereof, the same by itself would not mean that the persons whose lands were acquired were not interested in getting the allotment.	Reasoning
The locus standi of the respondent ought to have been taken into consideration having regard to the specific pleas raised in this behalf by the appellants herein.36.	Reasoning
Undue haste also is a matter which by itself would not have been a ground for exercise of power of judicial review unless it is held to be malafide.	Reasoning
What is necessary in such matters is not the time taken for allotment but the manner in which the action had been taken.	Reasoning
The court, it is trite, is not concerned with the merit of the decision but the decision making process.	Reasoning
In absence of any finding that any legal malice was committed, the impugned allotment of land could not have been interfered with.	Reasoning
What was only necessary to be seen was as to whether there had been a fair play in action.	None
The question as to whether any undue haste has been shown in taking an administrative decision is essentially a question of fact.	Issue

(See Bangalore Medical Trust vs. B.S. Muddappa and others (1991) 4 SCC 54 and Pfizer Ltd. vs. Mazdoor Congress and others (1996) 5 SCC 609 ).	None

These appeals are allowed.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
