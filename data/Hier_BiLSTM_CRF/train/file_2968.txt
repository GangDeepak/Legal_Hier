Issue
The acquittal of the other two accused namely Vishnu Prasad and Raju were affirmed and the appeal of the State against acquittal to that extent was disallowed.	Issue

Facts
Mr. Lalit learned counsel for the appellants very strenuously contended that the learned Additional Sessions Judge in his Judgment of acquittal dated 28th July, 1975 has elaborately discussed the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses and by giving very cogent reasons discarded the evidences adduced by the witnesses for the prosecution.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has contended that it is an admitted case of the parties that Vijay was in deep love with Geeta and such love affair was disliked by the family members of Geeta.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has submitted that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt, that up to very close to the time of murderous assault on Vijay, he and Geeta were moving together and came near Bada of Mangal Singh.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the knife which was found at the spot where the murder had taken place did not contain any blood stain.	Arguments of Petitioner
The prosecution case was that Shiv Narayan had inflicted knife injury on the person of Vijay and left the knife at the spot.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such case is completely belied by the fact that the said knife did not contain blood stain.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the contrary, the case of the defence was that on seeing Vijay Singh, Raju and his friend were chasing him when he was in the company of Geeta.	Arguments of Petitioner
At that stage Vijay Singh went to attack them with his knife which he was keeping on the advice of Geeta.	Arguments of Petitioner
He was however overpowered and ultimately done to death and the knife belonged to Vijay Singh.	Arguments of Petitioner
Precisely for the said reason there was no blood stain on the knife found at the spot.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has contended that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has taken pains in analysing the facts and circumstances of the case as also the probabilities on objective basis for.	Arguments of Petitioner
arriving at the finding that neither Ajay Singh nor Chatter Singh and Ram Gopal had any occasion to see the incident and they had falsely deposed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Sessions Judge was quite justified in discarding the evidences of the witnesses for the prosecution by giving cogent reasons and no exception could be made to such finding of the learned Additional Sessions Judge.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has also contended that the other alleged witnesses were declared hostile and they did not support the case of the prosecution and the learned Sessions Judge was therefore justified in discarding their version altogether.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr Lalit has also drawn the attention of the Court to the finding of the learned Additional Sessions Judge in so far as the same related to discarding the prosecution case of alleged oral dying declaration of the deceased Vijay.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has submitted that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has very carefully appreciated the evidences and has given very .cogent reason in coming to the finding that the deceased with such fatal injuries was not in a position to make dying declaration as alleged and no reliance should be placed on such oral dying declaration.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has contended that it is only unfortunate that a young man was murdered brutally.	Arguments of Petitioner
Though the incident is highly lamentable, the prosecution in its over zealousness to implicate the accused persons had not come out with true case.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has submitted that it was most likely that Raju Pathak and or his friend were the assailants but in the absence of any evidence to that effect by the prosecution the truth or otherwise of the murderous assault remained undisclosed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The prosecution case as sought to be made out being absolutely incredible, no conviction of the accused persons can be made.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has further submitted that it is only unfortunate that the Additional Sessions Judge had not placed any reliance on the oral dying declaration of the deceased Vijay Singh when he was considering the case of the three accused namely Shiv Narayan, Vishnu and Raju but when he was considering the case of accused Prakash he had accepted the same dying declaration and on the basis of the dying declaration convicted Prakash under section 302, IPC and sentenced him for life imprisonment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has contended that if a dying declaration cannot be accepted to be true for deciding the case of the three accused persons the same dying declaration cannot also be accepted to be, true for deciding the case of the coaccused Prakash.	Arguments of Petitioner
The credibility of the dying declaration has not undergone any change in the matter of the trial of one accused or the other.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has submitted that it is an accepted position in law that in an appeal against acquittal the Court should proceed with extreme care and caution and weigh the reasons given by the Trial Court in passing the judgment of. acquittal.	Arguments of Petitioner
Unless the finding of the Trial Court appears to be completely perverse or based on no evidence or on misreading of the evidence adduced in the case, no interference is called for against the verdict of acquittal.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Court of Appeal should not substitute its finding on its own appreciation of the evidence like the Trial Court in an appeal against acquittal.	Arguments of Petitioner
If the view taken by the Trial Court is a possible one it is not required to be interfered with.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has submitted that unfortunately the High Court became oblivious of the admitted position that almost up to the time of occurrence of the murderous assault, Vijay Singh and Geeta were together.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was most unlikely that Vijay thereafter had returned to his house and was asked by his father to accompany Vijay Kumar for the purpose of showing Vijay Kumar the residence of S. K. Singh.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the contrary, the case suggested by the defence was highly probable that Vijay Singh did not go with Vijay Kumar but was attacked by Raju Pathak and his friend when he was coming back with Geeta.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lalit has contended that the alleged oral dying declaration of Vijay Singh should be tested very critically and the court should be extremely careful in basing any conviction on the alleged oral dying declaration.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has contended that the injuries were so fatal that it was unlikely that the deceased was in a position to make dying declaration in the manner in which it was alleged.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has stated that after the said fatal injuries, intimation was sent to the father of the deceased and admittedly the father had to come to the spot which is situate at a distance comprising few furlongs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even if the father had come by a scooter one would reasonably accept that sufficient time was taken to go to the place of the father to inform him and considerable time was also taken by the father to reach the spot.	Arguments of Petitioner
In such circumstances, it will be very difficult to accept the prosecution case that the deceased was, fully conscious to make the alleged dying declaration naming the assailants.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Additional Sessions Judge in giving his judgment of acquittal has indicated the infirmities in the prosecution case in so far as the alleged oral dying declaration is concerned.	Arguments of Petitioner
The reasons by the Additional Sessions Judge in discarding the dying declaration in the judgment of acquittal are so convincing, that the same should be accepted by this Court, and the case alleged by the prosecution should be discarded.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Counsel has therefore submitted that the conviction of Prakash cannot also be sustained and the appeal should be allowed by setting aside the judgment of conviction.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has also submitted that the conviction of other accused Shiv Narayan under section 326 read with section 34 of the IPC should also be set aside because complicity of the accused could not be established beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel for the State of Madhya Pradesh however contended that the High Court was fully aware of the implications of the judgment of acquittal and has very dispassionately analysed the facts and circumstances of the case and evidences on record.	Arguments of Respondent
The evidences adduced in the case, despite minor discrepancies, clearly established the involvement of the accused Prakash and Shiv Narayan in the act of murderous assault on the deceased on the date of occurrence.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court has given benefit of doubt to the two accused persons namely Raju and Vishnu Prasad and did not interfere with the order of acquittal passed in their favour because they were entitled to benefit of doubt.	Arguments of Respondent
Even in the case of Shiv Narayan, the High Court has not accepted the prosecution case that Shiv Narayan had himself inflicted knife injuries on the deceased, although Shiv Narayan was found to have taken very active part in the matter of inflicting injuries on the person of the deceased.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court on a dispassionate analysis of the case came to the finding that the common intention to cause the death of the deceased could not be convincingly attributed to the accused, Shiv Narayan in the absence of sufficient material to prove otherwise particularly when no blood stain was found on the knife found at the spot.	Arguments of Respondent
Since he was also armed with knife and was party to attack on the deceased, the High Court has taken a very lenient view in convicting the accused Shiv Narayan not under section 302, IPC but under section 326 read with S. 34, IPC and even in the matter of awarding the sentence, the High Court has taken a very lenient view in so far as Shiv Narayan is concerned.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel for the State has contended that dying declaration should not have been discarded by the learned Addl.	Arguments of Respondent
Judge.	Arguments of Respondent
There is no evidence to warrant the finding that the deceased was not in a position to make a dying declaration.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel has contended that the deceased was alive at least for 30 to 45 minutes after the incident and the doctor who had treated the deceased in the hospital and had held post mortem did not state that it was not possible for the deceased to make a dying declaration.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel has also submitted that the reasons given by the High Court are so convincing that no other view is warranted.	Arguments of Respondent
He has submitted that there is no occasion for interfering with that judgment passed by the High Court and appeals should be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
After giving our anxious consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and the arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties and judgment delivered both by the Additional Sessions Judge and the HighCourt of Madhya Pradesh, it appears to us that the fatal injuries had been inflicted by Prakash with the gupti.	Reasoning
The gupti was recovered at the instance of the accused and such recovery was not otherwise possible if the accused himself had not assisted for such recovery of the gupti.	Reasoning
The said gupti was stained with human blood and no reasonable explanation has been given by accused for such blood stain.	Reasoning
The injuries found on the person of the deceased could be inflicted by a gupti and complicity of Prakash in inflicting the fatal injuries by gupti has been corroborated by the eyewitness.	Reasoning
There may be some minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eyewitness but so far as the complicity of Prakash is concerned, the depositions of the eyewitnesses were consistent.	None
In discarding the evidence of the brother of the deceased namely Ajay Singh the learned Additional Sessions Judge was influenced by the tender age of Ajay (about 14 years) and was of the view that he was likely to be tutored.	Reasoning
We do not think that a boy of about 14 years of age cannot give a proper account of the murder of his brother if he has an occasion to witness the same and simply because the witness was a boy of 14 years it will not be proper to assume that he is likely to be tutored.	Reasoning
The High Court has given very convincing reasons for accepting the evidence of Ajay Singh as an eye witness of the murderous act and we do not find any infirmity in the finding made by the High Court.	Reasoning
In so far as the dying declaration is concerned, we are inclined to accept the finding of the High Court that the deceased was alive at least up to half an hour after the assault.	Reasoning
He had been taken to the hospital where he received some treatment for about 1015 minutes.	Reasoning
It is not borne out from the evidence of the doctor that the injuries were so grave and the condition of the patient was so critical that it was unlikely that he could make any dying declaration.	Reasoning
In the ordinary course, the members of the family including the father were expected to ask the victim the names of the assailants at the first opportunity and if the victim was in a position to communicate, it is reasonably expected that he would give the names of the assailants if he had recognised the assailants.	Reasoning
In the instant case there is no occasion to hold that the deceased was not in a position to identify the assailants because it is nobodys case that the deceased did not know the accused persons.	Reasoning
It is therefore quite likely that on being asked the deceased would name the assailants.	Reasoning
In the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has accepted the dying declaration and we do not think that such a finding is perverse and requires to be interfered with.	Reasoning
As a matter of fact, on second thought, the learned Additional Sessions Judge has accepted the dying declaration and has convicted Prakash on the basis of dying declaration.	Reasoning
The injuries inflicted by Prakash were very serious on vital parts of the body causing death of the deceased within a very short time.	Reasoning
In such circumstances, conviction under Section 502, IPC and sentence of life imprisonment of the accused Prakash is justified and no interference is called for.	Reasoning
In our view.	Reasoning
the High Court has taken a very reasonable view in convicting the other accused namely Shiv Narayan under Section 326 read with Section 34, IPC and has considered his case with such sympathy as the.	Reasoning
said accused deserved by sentencing him for imprisonment for the period already undergone by him, for an offence under Section 326 read with Section 34, IPC.	Reasoning
We, therefore, find no reason to interfere with the conviction or the sentence passed against the accused Shiv Narayan.	Decision
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed.	Decision
The bail bond of the accused Prakash is discharged and he would surrender and serve out the sentence.	Decision
Appeals dismissed.	None
