On March 5, 1966, the Government of Mysore referred to the same Tribunal for adjudication the following questionWhether the demand of the workers of Bangalore Woollen, Cotton and Silk Mills Co., Ltd., Bangalore, for additional bonus for the years 1962 and 1963 at the rate of 2 months additional bonus and 4 months additional bonus on total wages respectively is justified?

5.	None
This Reference was numbered as A.I.D. 8 of 1966, Civil Appeal No. 1292 of 1967 is directed against that part of the order of the Tribunal regarding this Reference.	Facts
Both the appeals are by the Company.	Facts
6.	None
We will first take up Civil Appeal No. 1291 of 1967.	Facts
The appellant was making two payments of bonus every year, one for the halfyear ending 30th June and halfyear ending 30th December.	Facts
The accounting year is the calendar year.	Facts
The halfyearly payments were unilaterally declared by the appellant and not on the basis of any agreement between the parties.	Facts
The quantum of bonus that was paid for each halfyear was also not constant.	Facts
Halfyearly payments were made at the end of the halfyear when the working result of the said year was known and if there was sufficient profit to pay bonus.	Facts
The payment of bonus for the halfyears also depended upon the approximate estimate that the Directors used to make about their prospective future earnings for the next halfyear.	Facts
According to the appellant the bonus amounts were paid out of profits.	Facts
As the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 (hereinafter to be referred to as the Act) had come into force on August 28, 1965, the appellant issued a circular to the effect that for the halfyear ending June 30, 1965, payments will be made as advance of wages equivalent to 1/6th of the basic earnings of the employees.	Facts
In this circular there is a reference to the Payment of Bonus Ordinance, 1965, promulgated on May 29, 1965 and that under the terms of the Ordinance, bonus is payable only within a period of 8 months from the end of the accounting year.	Facts
The circular further states that no bonus is payable for the accounting year 1965 until the accounts for the year are closed.	Facts
It was further mentioned that the amounts are paid as advance wages in view of the representations made by the employees.	Facts
The circular further mentioned that the amounts paid as advance wages will be set off against the bonus that may be found payable for the accounting year 1965 and that if no bonus is payable, the amount paid will be adjusted against the wages due for any month after March, 1966.	Facts
7.	None
The issue of the above circular led to the unions concerned raising a dispute with the management that the payment of bonus at the end of each halfyear has become a condition of service of the workmen as the same was being paid for several decades without any relation to profits.	Facts
The appellant was charged by the unions of having changed the conditions of service by offering to make payments as advance against wages instead of payment by way of bonus.	Facts
As conciliation proceedings failed, the workmen resorted to a strike in December 1965, which led to the Reference being made by State Government on December 8, 1965, No. A.I.D. 6 of 1966.	Facts
8.	None
The short stand taken by the appellant before the Tribunal was that the payments were being made as bonus at the end of each halfyear on the basis of the profits earned by the Company.	None
Such payment was a voluntary act of the appellant and related to profit and it had not become a condition of service of the employees.	None
The further case of the appellant is that as the Act had come into force, bonus is governed by the provisions of the Act and that bonus is to be paid only within eight months after the close of the year of account, i.e., December 31, 1965.	Facts
9.	None
The unions pleaded that the payment of bonus at the end of eachd halfyear, which was being done for a long number of years, has become a condition of service and the amounts paid were not related to the profits earned by the Company.	Facts
The unions further contended that the Act has not in any manner affected the right of the employees getting bonus in the manner paid by the appellant, namely, at the end of every halfyear.	Facts
10.	None
The Tribunal has recorded the following findings The payment of bonus was not a settled condition of service, but is dependent upon the profits earned during halfyear.	None
Payments made by the appellant at the close of the halfyear cannot be considered as customary or festival bonus and that the appellant has made no change in the conditions of service of the workmen by altering the quantum of bonus.	None
Though bonus was paid at the close of each halfyear, the quantum of such bonus varied depending upon the profits earned by the Company.	None
The Company has no doubt been paying for a long time profit bonus in two instalments, namely, in the month of August for the halfyear ending 30th June and in the month of March or April of the succeeding year for the halfyear ending 31st December.	None
The coming into force of the Act has not created any right in the appellant to withhold the payment for each halfyear as it used to do.	None
The appellant will be entitled to deduct the amount of bonus paid for the first halfyear from the amount of bonus payable to its employees under the Act in respect of the accounting year and the employees will be entitled to receive only the balance for the second halfyear.	None
On these findings the Tribunal held that the appellant was not justified in announcing the payment of the amount towards advance wages under the circular dated August 28, 1965.	None
In the end the Tribunal gave a direction to the effect that the appellant is liable to pay profit bonus in two instalmentsone as advance against the final declaration of bonus to be paid during the last week of August or first week of September and the balance, if any, was to be paid in the month of March or first week of April of the succeeding year.	None
It further gave a direction that the first payment that is to be paid is to be as advance against payment of bonus and not as against wages.	None
11.	None
Mr. Malhotra, learned counsel for the appellant, has challenged the above directions given by the Tribunal.	Arguments of Petitioner
The counsel pointed out that after the coming into force of the Act, the rights and liabilities of the parties, regarding bonus, are governed by its provisions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under the Act, the computations of the available and allocable surplus have to be made on the basis of the gross profits ascertained at the end of the relevant accounting year and the payment of bonus has to be made within eight months of the close of the accounting year.	Arguments of Petitioner
As the Act envisages payment of only one bonus, at the end of the accounting year, after computation of the amount as per the Act, the direction given by the Tribunal regarding payment of halfyearly bonus is illegal and contrary to the provisions of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
This direction, the counsel pointed out, given by The Tribunal, will apply not only to the year 1965, but also to all succeeding years.12.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Mr. H. K. Puri, learned counsel for the respondents Nos. 2 and 3, whose contentions have been accepted by the counsel for the other respondents, urged that the Act does not prohibit an employer from paying bonus at the end of each halfyear.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant has been paying bonus in two instalments, namely, at the end of each halfyear.	Arguments of Respondent
It is always open to the appellant, both by virtue of the provisions of the Act and the direction given by the Tribunal to deduct when paying final bonus at the end of the accounting year, any amounts that may have been paid for the first halfyear.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, according to Mr. Puri, the directions given by the Tribunal are neither illegal nor contrary to the provisions of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
13.	None
We are not inclined to accept the contentions of Mr. Puri.	Reasoning
We have already referred to the findings of the Tribunal to the effect that the amount that was paid by the appellant as bonus at the end of each halfyear was on the basis of the profits earned by it.	Reasoning
The Tribunal has rejected the claim of the unions that the payment of bonus, in the manner claimed by them, was not a condition of service and that the payment had nothing to do with any custom or festival.	Reasoning
These findings have not been and in fact could not be challenged by the respondents.	Reasoning
There is also no controversy that payment of bonus for the accounting year 1965 is governed by the provisions of the Act.	Reasoning
If so, the question is whether the directions given by the Tribunal and referred to above, can be supported by the provisions of the Act.	None
14.	None
The Act has come into force with effect from August 28, 1965.	None
As provided under subsection (4) of Section 1, it applies to all accounting years commencing on any day in the year 1964 and in respect of every subsequent accounting year.	None
Section 2 defines amongst others the expressions accounting year, allocable surplus, available surplus and gross profits.	None
Section 4 deals with the computation of gross profits.	None
So far as the appellant is concerned, under Section 4, Cl.	None
(b), the gross profits are to be calculated in the manner specified in the Second Schedule.	None
Section 5 provides for computation of available surplus.	None
It is to be ascertained after deducting from the gross profits the various items, referred to in Section 6.	None
Section 6 deals with the items to be deducted as prior charges from the gross profits.	None
Section 10 makes it obligatory on an employer to pay minimum bonus to the employees in an accounting year of 4 per cent of his salary or wages or Rs. 40, whichever is higher.	None
This payment is irrespective of the fact whether a company has or has not earned profits in an accounting year.	None
But this provision is subject to the provisions of Sections 8 and 13.	None
Section 11 provides for payment of bonus subject to a maximum of 20 per cent of the salary or wages, if the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied.	None
Section 17 enables an employer, who has paid during any accounting year Puja Bonus or other customary bonus or a part of the bonus payable under the Act before the due date, to deduct the amount so paid from the amount of bonus payable by him to an employee under the Act in respect of that accounting year.	None
It further provides that under such circumstances the employee will be entitled to receive only the balance.	None
Section 19 fixed the time limit for payment of bonus.	None
If there is a dispute regarding payment of bonus pending before any authority, the bonus will have to be paid within a month from the date on which the Award becomes enforceable or the settlement comes into operation.	None
In any other case the bonus will have to be paid within a period of eight months from the close of the accounting year.	None
Under the proviso to Section 19, power is given to the appropriate Government to extend the period of eight months in accordance with the provisions contained therein.	None
Section 34 provides that the Act except as otherwise provided in the section, shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the terms of any Award, agreement, settlement or contract of service made before May 29, 1965.	None
15.	None
We have referred to some of the relevant provisions of the Act.	None
From a perusal of the scheme of the Act, it is clear that the bonus for a particular accounting year will have to be computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act on the basis of the grossprofits which are determined at the close of the accounting year.	None
The Act itself provides as to how the grossprofits are to be calculated and the available and allocable surplus arrived at.	None
The Act also provides the outer limit, the period within which bonus has to be paid.	None
It further gives the employer a right to deduct any amount that may have been paid during the accounting year as part of the bonus payable under the Act.	None
16.	None
It will be seen from the scheme of the Act that the claim for bonus can be made only after the close of the accounting year and in accordance with the provisions of the Act.	None
The grossprofits can be calculated only at the end of the accounting year and the available and allocable surplus can also be worked out only at the end of the accounting year.	None
There is no question of an employer computing the grossprofits, available and allocable surplus in the middle of an accounting year or at any time before the close of the relevant accounting year.	None
The direction given by the Tribunal really amounts to the employer having to make two computations at the end of each halfyear.	None
No doubt, the Tribunal has given a direction to the effect that any amount paid for the first halfyear can be deducted when the final bonus is paid at the end of the accounting year.	Arguments of Respondent
Even without any such consideration being shown by the Tribunal allowing an employer to so deduct, Section 17 itself clearly gives such a right to an employer.	None
We are not impressed with the contention of Mr. Puri that as there is no prohibition in the Act against an employer making the payment by way of bonus at the end of a halfyear, the direction given by the Tribunal can be sustained.	None
17.	None
Mr. Puri referred us particularly to the provisions contained in Section 17 of the Act.	None
He pointed out that though a time limit is fixed by Section 19, the Act itself as is evident from Section 17, clearly envisages payment of bonus at the end of each halfyear.	None
We are not inclined to accept this contention of Mr. Puri.	Reasoning
The direction given by the Tribunal making it obligatory on the Management to make half yearly payment of bonus, apart from being opposed to the scheme of the Act, also runs counter to the provisions of Section 19.	Reasoning
Whether it is the minimum bonus of 4 per cent, under Section 19 or the maximum bonus of 20 per cent, under Section 11, they have to be paid, as is made clear by Section 19, only within the period mentioned therein.	Reasoning
It may be that an employer voluntarily pays amount during the accounting year by way of part bonus which he is entitled to take into account and adjust when making final payment at the close of the accounting year.	Reasoning
It is one thing to say that an employer can make voluntary payment, but it is a different thing for the Tribunal to give a direction to that effect.	Reasoning
18. Section 17 on which reliance is placed by Mr. Puri is as follows Where in any accounting year (a) an employer has paid any puja bonus or other customary bonus on an employee or (b) an employer has paid a part of the bonus payable under this Act to an employee before the date on which such bonus becomes payable, then the employer shall be entitled to deduct the amount of bonus so paid from the amount of bonus payable by him to the employee under this Act in respect of that accounting year and the employee shall be entitled to receive only the balance.	None
19.	None
Clause (a) has no application as the Tribunal has categorically held that there is no question of any payment by way of puja bonus or other customary bonus.	None
Even then, if any such bonus has been paid, the employer is entitled to deduct the same from the amount of bonus payable under the Act.	None
Clause (b) is an enabling section in favour of the employer in that it visualises a situation or contingency where he may have paid during the accounting year a part of bonus payable under the Act before the date on which such bonus becomes payable.	None
If an employer has paid any amount during an accounting year by way of part of the bonus, he is entitled to deduct the same from the final amounts that may be payable under the Act.	None
That provision does not give a right to an employee to claim payment of bonus even by way of part payment during the currency of the accounting year.	None
If so, the Tribunal has also no jurisdiction to give a direction to an employer to pay bonus at the end of each halfyear.	None
20.	None
In this case, it is no doubt, seen that the appellant has been paying bonus at the end of each halfyear.	Reasoning
But the Tribunal has found that such payment has not become a condition of service.	Reasoning
Therefore by the mere fact that the appellant has been making payments on previous occasions every halfyearly, does not confer a right on the employee to have such payments by way of bonus in the same manner even after the Act came into force.	Reasoning
21.	None
From the above discussion it follows that the directions given by the Tribunal in A.I.D. No. 6 of 1966 have to be set aside.	Decision
22.	None
Now coming to Civil Appeal No. 1292 of 1967, as mentioned earlier, it is against that part of the Award of the Tribunal in A. I. D. No. 8 of 1966.	Facts
The question that was referred to the Tribunal has also been extracted in the earlier part of the judgment.	Facts
That relates to a claim for additional bonus for the years 1962 and 1963.	Facts
There is no controversy that the appellant has already paid for the year 1962, three months basic wages as bonus.	Facts
Similarly for the year 1963 also four months basic wages as bonus has already been paid.	Facts
The claim was for two months total wages as additional bonus for the year 1962 and four months total wages as additional bonus for the year 1963.	Facts
The findings recorded by the Tribunal in A. I. D. No. 6 of 1966 regarding the nature of bonus paid to the employees have been adopted for this reference also.	Facts
The respondentsUnions do not challenge those findings.	Facts
Therefore, even in respect of the years 1962 and 1963, what is payable is only profit bonus.	Facts
There is also no controversy that for these two years the quantum of bonus payable has to be calculated in accordance with what is known as the Labour Appellate Tribunal Full Bench Formula, which has been approved by this Court in Associated Cement Co. Ltd., Dwarka Cement Works, Dwarka v. Its Workmen, 1959 SCR 925 (AIR 1959 SC 967 ).	Facts
Both the parties have filed statements of calculations according to the said Formula.	Facts
The statements Exs. M1 and M2 filed by the Management represent the computation of available surplus for the years ended December 31, 1962 and 1963 respectively, Ex. M1 is as follows THE BANGALORE WOOLLEN, COTTON AND SILK MILLS CO., LTD.	Facts

The Tribunal has accepted as correct the grossprofits as given by the appellant in these two exhibits for the two years in question.	Facts
Even though the Unions contested the return on Preference Share Capital at 7.8 per cent., the Tribunal has rejected their objections.	Facts
It has held that under the Preference Shares Regulations Act, the Company is bound to pay 7.8 per cent on Preference Share Capital.	Facts
The Workmen did not raise any controversy regarding the return on Ordinary Share Capital at 6 per cent.	Facts
The Tribunal, therefore, accepted the figures given in both Exs. M1 and M2 and to the return of Ordinary Share Capital.	Facts
But the controversy arose about the claim made by the appellant regarding return on Reserves employed during the two years.	Facts
It will be noted that neither in Ex. M1 nor in Ex.	Facts
M2 the appellant has made any claim for rehabilitation excepting adding a note to the statement that they are subject to a claim for rehabilitation.	Facts
25.	None
The two points in controversy between the parties regarding these two years were (1) The claim for Return on Reserves and (2) Provision for Rehabilitation.	Issue
26.	None
We will first take up the question regarding the claim of the appellant for return on Reserves.	Reasoning
In Ex. M1, the appellant has claimed a sum of Rs. 17833.00 as 4 per cent, return of Rs. 44468315.00, being the amount employed in business.	Reasoning
Similar by in Ex. M2, for the year 1963, it had claimed Rs. 1877518.00, being 4 per cent.	Reasoning
return on Reserves on Rs. 46937947.00, employed in the business.	Reasoning
The Unions contested the claim of the appellant on the ground that they are not entitled to any return on Reserves.	Reasoning
The appellant had filed two statements Exs. M1 (a) and M2 (b) for the years 1962 and 1963 respectively, showing how the amounts claimed as Reserves employed in business have been arrived at Ex. M1 (a) for the year 1962 is as follows THE BANGALORE WOOLLEN, COTTON AND SILK MILLS CO., LTD.	Reasoning

It will be seen that the last figures shown in both the statements have been claimed by the appellant as Reserves employed in business for each of these two years.	None
29.	None
The Tribunal after a reference to the evidence of the Chartered Accountant, M.W. 1 has held that the amounts which should have been used as Working Capital are those mentioned in Exs. M1 (a) and M2 (a), less the fixed assets and capital works in progress.	Facts
The Tribunal has further held that the working capital cannot include fixed assets nor the capital works in progress, as they represent the funds required for day to day work of the Company.	Facts
According to the Tribunal these fixed assets have been accumulated over years and they cannot form part of the working capital.	Facts
However, the Tribunal accepted the claim of the appellant that the other items in Exs. M1 (a) and M2 (a), namely, investments, interest accrued on investments, stores and spare parts, raw materials process stocks, finished stocks, sundry debtors, advances etc., are the amounts available to be used as working capital.	Facts
On this reasoning the Tribunal held that in calculating the return on working capital, the amounts mentioned in Ex. M1 (a) and M2 (a) less the amount sunk in fixed assets and working capital in progress, have to be deducted.	Facts
On this basis it deducted from Rs. 44468315, a sum of Rupees 43139570, and fixed a sum of Rs. 1328745, as Reserves employed in business during the year ended December 31, 1962.	Facts
On this amount it allowed a sum of Rs. 53150/ as return on Reserves at 4 per cent, for the year 1962.	Facts
30.	None
Similarly, for the year 1963, it deducted from Rs. 46937947, a sum of Rs. 45229423, and fixed a sum of Rs. 1708524/ as Reserves employed in business during that year.	Facts
On this amount it allowed Rs. 68340 as return on Reserves at 4 per cent.	Facts
31.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Malhotra, learned counsel for the appellant, while accepting that the principle adopted by the Tribunal in this regard is correct, contended that it had made a mistake in calculation.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, the claim must have been allowed in the manner calculated by the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, the learned counsel pointed out that even in cases where the evidence regarding the utilisation of Reserves as Working Capital as claimed by the Company, is not very satisfactory, this Court, on the basis of the balance sheets, which indicated that some amount must have been used as working capital has allowed such a claim.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, he relied on Workmen of M s. Hindustan Motors Ltd. v. M s. Hindustan Motors Ltd., (1968) 2	Arguments of Petitioner
SCR 311 (AIR 1968 SC 963 ) and Aluminium Corporation of India v. Their Workmen, (1969) 3 SCC 832.	Arguments of Petitioner
32.	Arguments of Petitioner
We may straightway say that these decisions do not assist the appellant.	Reasoning
In the case before us it is not necessary to do any guesswork as the appellant wants us to do.	Reasoning
The appellant has filed statements showing how it has calculated the amount of reserve utilised as working capital and we have to find out whether the calculations made by it are correct.	Reasoning
In fact, Mr. Malhotra has not been able to point out from the balance sheets, as to what amount, according to the appellant, can be considered to have been used as working capital.	Reasoning
In the two decisions, relied on by him, the company concerned was able to refer to the figures in the balance sheets from which this Court was able to draw a conclusion regarding the approximate amount that would have been utilised as working capital.	Reasoning
The position before us is entirely different.	Reasoning
33.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Mr. Puri, learned counsel for the respondents, referred us to the balance sheets for the years in question regarding the share capital of the company being shown as Rs. 1,27,50,000.	None
The counsel further pointed out that the said share capital must have been sunk in acquiring the fixed assets and for capital works in progress and, therefore, the Tribunal was justified in deducting the amount of fixed assets and capital works in progress shown in Exhibits M1 (a) and M2 (a) from the total shown by the appellant in those statements.	None
The counsel further urged that in considering the claim for return on working capital two questions have to be kept in view (1) Whether the Reserves were available, and if they were (2) whether they were used as working capital and if so, what is that amount?The Tribunal, in our opinion has correctly kept these two principles in view in arriving at the amount of Reserves used as working capital and on which a return is to be allowed.	None
We see no error committed by the tribunal in the calculation made for arriving at the Reserves which must have been used as working capital, especially as the evidence on the side of the appellant was very unsatisfactory.	None
Even the appellant has deducted the amount of share capital before arriving at the final figures mentioned in Exhibits M1 (a) and M2 (a).But the appellant was claiming the whole of the final amount shown in these two statements as reserves used as working capital, which it was not certainly entitled to in law.	None
34.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have already pointed out that the Tribunal has held that the working capital cannot include fixed assets nor the capital works in progress as it represents the funds required for daytoday running of the company.	Reasoning
The Tribunal has further held that the appellant is entitled to deduct investments, interest accrued on investments, etc., which have been shown in Exhibits M1 (a) and M2 (a) on the ground that they must be considered to be the amounts available to be used as working capital.	Reasoning
These findings have not been challenged by the learned counsel for the appellant.	Reasoning
The appellant has also filed details of reserves employed in the business during the years ended 31st December, 1962 and 1963 as shown in Exhibits M1 (b) and M2 (b) respectively.	Reasoning
Even there the appellant has deducted the share capital before giving final figures.	Reasoning
35.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the contention of Mr. Malhotra that the Tribunal has committed a mistake in calculating the amount of Reserve used as working capital for these two years, cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
If so, it follows that the amount fixed by the Tribunal as return at 4 per cent on Reserves used as working capital for these two years, is correct.	None
36.	Arguments of Petitioner
The second question that arises for consideration is the claim made by the appellant for provision for rehabilitation for the two years and which claim has been rejected by the Tribunal.	Arguments of Petitioner
The claim made by the appellant for provision for rehabilitation for the year 1962 was Rs. 1,80,30,871.00 and for the year 1963 Rs. 1,80,62,336.00.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, the appellant was claiming for each year provision being made of more than a crore of rupees for rehabilitation.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant has filed a charge Exhibit M8 giving the calculations for the year 1962, its claim for rehabilitation for Rs. 1,80,30,871.00.	Arguments of Petitioner
If the claim for rehabilitation is accepted, then the result will be that there will be no profits at all from and out of which any bonus can be paid for the years in question.37.	Arguments of Petitioner
The claim of the appellant has been opposed by Mr. I. N. Keshava, learned counsel for the first respondent and his contentions have been adopted by the counsel appearing for the other respondentsunions.	None
The claim of the appellant is opposed mainly on two grounds, namely, (1) that the appellant has no scheme for rehabilitation for the relevant years and (2) in any event there were huge reserves available from which the claim for rehabilitation can be easily met.	None
The Tribunal has rejected the claim for rehabilitation both on the grounds that the appellant has no scheme for rehabilitation and that the rehabilitation claim can be adequately met with from the huge reserves of nearly four crores of rupees that the appellant had.	None
38.It must be noted that Rehabilitation Reserve is a substantial item which goes to reduce the available surplus and as a result affects the right of the employees to receive the bonus.	None
Hence the employer will have to place all relevant materials and the Tribunal will have to scrutinise them carefully and be satisfied that the claim is justified.	Reasoning
It is no doubt true that it is but proper in the larger interest of the industry as well as the employees that proper rehabilitation reserve should be built up taking into consideration the increase in price in plant and machinery which has to be replaced at a future date and by determination of multiplier and its divisor.	Reasoning
It is also clear from the decisions of this Court that if a company has no scheme for rehabilitation, then, of course, its claim on that head must be rejected (vide Azam Jahi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen, (1967) 2 Lab LJ 18 (AIR 1967 SC 1222 ).	Reasoning
Further, since it is the employer who seeks replacement costs, it is for him to satisfy the Tribunal as to what will be the overall cost of replacement and in doing so, it is he who has to discharge this burden by adducing proper evidence and giving other party an opportunity to test the correctness of that evidence by crossexamination (vide National Engineering Industries Ltd. v. Its Workmen, (1968)	Reasoning
1	Reasoning
SCR 779 (AIR 1968 SC 538 ).	None
39.It is also now well settled that in determining the claim of the employer for rehabilitation, 2 factors are essential to be ascertained, namely, (1) the multiplier, and that has to be done by reference to the purchase price of the machinery and the price which has to be paid for rehabilitation or replacement and (2) the determination of the diviser and that has to be done by deciding the probable life of the machinery(vide Honorary Secy., South India Millowners Association and others v. Secy., Coimbatore District Textiles Workers Union, (1962)	Reasoning
Supp 2 SCR 926 (AIR 1962 SC 1221 ) and Messrs. Gannon Dunkerley and Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen, AIR 1971 SC 2567 .	Reasoning
40.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Malhotra, learned counsel for the appellant, very strongly relied on the statement Exhibit M8 as well as the evidence of M.W. 2, the Mill Manager and M.W. 3, the Assistant Officer, Efficiency Section of the Mill, in support of his contention that the appellant has a scheme for rehabilitation and that the claim made by the appellant for making provision for rehabilitation is proper.	Arguments of Petitioner
The counsel also pointed out that the evidence of these two witnesses clearly establishes that most of the items of machinery have long outlived their normal age of 25 years and therefore they require replacement in order to ensure proper production.	Arguments of Petitioner
The counsel further pointed out that the rejection by the Tribunal of the claim made by the appellant on the basis that the life of the textile machinery is only 25 years, is not correct and that the view of the Tribunal that the normal age is more than 25 years is opposed to the decisions of this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
41.	Arguments of Petitioner
So far as the age of the machinery is concerned, it is no doubt true that in (1962)	Reasoning
Supp 2 SCR 926 (AIR 1962 SC 1221 )	Reasoning
this Court, after a reference to the evidence adduced, confirmed the findings of the Tribunal that the estimated life of the textile machinery in question should be taken to be 25 years, but in the said decision itself it is observed as followsWe are not prepared to accept either argument because, in our opinion, the life of the machinery in every case has to be determined in the light of evidence adduced by the parties.	Reasoning
But it is unnecessary for us to pursue this aspect further as we are disallowing the entire claim for rehabilitation.	Reasoning
42.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Malhotra, also criticised the view of the Tribunal that in this case the evidence of the witnesses on the side of the appellant clearly shows that the machines are working very efficiently though they have been running for over 50 years.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, the counsel urged that the principle to be borne in mind, when considering the claim for rehabilitation, is that the life of the machinery is the period during which it is estimated to work with reasonable efficiency and not the period during which it has actually been operated, that is, till it becomes too deteriorated for use.	Arguments of Petitioner
No doubt the last proposition enunciated by the counsel in the abstract is correct but the question is whether the appellant has discharged its burden of satisfying the Tribunal that it had a scheme for rehabilitation and whether it had placed the necessary materials for the purpose of working out the multiplier and the divisor.	Arguments of Petitioner
43.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Keshava, learned counsel for the first respondent, referred us to the written statement filed by one of the unions, Binny Mills Labour Association, wherein it has specifically stated that the plant and machinery owned by the Mills are amongst the most modern machineries and that no provision for rehabilitation is necessary.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant, it is pointed out, in its reply statement did not controvert these averments.	Arguments of Respondent
Even in the statements Exhibits M1 and M2, filed by the appellant, no claim for rehabilitation has been made.	Arguments of Respondent
He also referred to the evidence of M.Ws. 2 and 3 and pointed out that their evidence does not show that the Company had any scheme for rehabilitation.	Arguments of Respondent
On these grounds, the counsel pointed out that the appellant has not placed sufficient materials before the Tribunal to sustain its claim for rehabilitation.	Arguments of Respondent
44.	Arguments of Petitioner
It must be emphasised that in dealing with the claim of an employer for rehabilitation, as pointed out earlier, the onus of proof is on the employer.	None
He has to prove the price of the plant and the machinery, its age, the period during which it requires replacement, the cost of replacement, the amount standing in the debentures and reserve funds and to what extent the funds at its disposal would meet the cost of replacement.	None
If the employer fails to lead satisfactory evidence on these points, the result will be that the claim for rehabilitation will have to be totally rejected.	None
45.	None
It is no doubt true that a chart Exhibit M8 has been filed by the appellant and M.W. 3, the Assistant Officer, Efficiency Section, has spoken regarding the same.	None
But he has admitted that the original quotations received from the dealers regarding the price of new machinery for the purpose of replacement have not been produced before the Tribunal.	None
He has further admitted that the appellant has not produced the letters written by it calling for quotations regarding the price of the machinery.	None
He has further admitted that no charts have been produced to show the value of the machineries in 1962.	None
The multipliers, according to this witness, have been adopted as advised by the appellants legal adviser.	None
46.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is clear from the above answers of the witness that there is no material placed before the Tribunal by the appellant from which the multiplier and divisor can be properly worked out for the purpose of considering the claim for rehabilitation.	Reasoning
In fact, the Mill Manager, M.W. 2 has stated that the company has floated a debenture for 1 1/2 crore for buying new machinery.	Reasoning
This clearly shows that the appellant had no scheme for rehabilitation and that explains the reason why it had not made any provision for rehabilitation.	Reasoning
47.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Malhotra then urged that at any rate the Tribunal itself has proceeded on the basis that some amount for rehabilitation is necessary to be provided for each year.	Arguments of Petitioner
Based on this observation of the Tribunal, the counsel pointed out that the appellant should be allowed at least the amount that it has actually spent for replacement of machineries in the years 1962 and 1963.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him a sum of Rs. 26,19,608 and Rs. 21,24,102 have been spent in the years 1962 and 1963, respectively, for machinery and plant installed in those years.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection he referred us to the balance sheet and profit and loss accounts for these two years and stressed that the Tribunal has committed an error in not allowing at least these amounts by way of provision for rehabilitation.48.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is no doubt true that these amounts are shown in the schedules to the balance sheets for the years concerned.	Reasoning
Admittedly, there is no such claim made in the written statement filed by the appellant before the Tribunal.	Reasoning
When the unions were contesting the claim of the appellant on the ground that it has no scheme for rehabilitation and that it has not spent any amount by way of replacement of old machinery, it was the duty of the appellant to have made a proper claim and it should have adduced evidence regarding that aspect before the Tribunal.	Reasoning
Mere production of balance sheet and profit and loss accounts by themselves will not entitle the appellant to sustain its claim for rehabilitation.	Reasoning
49.	Arguments of Petitioner
For all the reasons given above, it is clear that the Tribunal was justified in holding that the appellant has not been able to make out its claim for making provision for rehabilitation.	Reasoning
In this view the Tribunal was justified in rejecting this claim of the appellant.	Reasoning
50.	None
We may also state that the Tribunal is also of the view that the appellant has large reserves with which it can meet rehabilitation expenses of the machinery.	Reasoning
In this connection the Tribunal has also referred to the evidence on the side of the appellant, that even according to the appellant rehabilitation will have to be completed only within eight years from 1962 and that only a sum of rupees eighty lakhs will be required for each year.	Reasoning
On this reasoning the Tribunal has held that this amount of rupees eighty lakhs can be easily met with from the large reserves available with the appellant.	Reasoning
It is not necessary for us to consider this aspect further because we have already agreed with the findings of the Tribunal that the appellant has no scheme for rehabilitation and that it has not placed any satisfactory evidence before the Tribunal in support of its claim.	None
51.	Arguments of Petitioner
The last point that arises for consideration is regarding the available surplus for the years 1962 and 1963 as calculated by the Tribunal and the award by it of onethird of the amount as additional bonus for the two years after deducting the bonus already paid by the appellant.	None
The Tribunal, after rejecting the appellants claim for rehabilitation and also allowing return on reserves used as working capital in the manner, already referred to, had arrived at the available surplus for the year 1962 in the sum of Rs. 26,35,914 and for the year 1963 at Rs. 49,04,987.	None
The appellant filed a statement Exhibit M4 showing the amount of bonus already paid for the years 1962 and 1963 to all employees drawing a total of Rs. 500 and less per mensem.	Reasoning
From that statement it is seen that for the year 1962 it had paid a sum of Rs. 14,41,455 and for the year 1963 a sum of Rs. 19,60,795.	Reasoning
On the basis of the available surplus worked out for the years 1962 and 1963, the balance available surplus after deducting bonus already paid will be as follows 1962Rs.	Reasoning
Available surplus as worked out by the Tribunal26,35,914 Amount already paid as bonus by the appellant14,41,455 Balance11,94,459 1963Rs.	None
Available surplus as worked out by the Tribunal49,04,987 Amount already paid as bonus by the appellant19,60,795 Balance29,44,192 What the Tribunal has done is to distribute onethird of the amount shown as balance above, for each of the years as additional bonus.	None
That results in the workmen getting Rs. 3,98,153 representing 25 days basic wages as additional bonus for the year 1962.	None
Similarly, the workmen get Rs. 9,81,397 representing two months basic wages as additional bonus for the year 1963.	None
52.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, it will be seen that the total bonus that the workmen will get for each of the years will be as follows 1962Rs.	None

From the avilable surplus of Rs. 26,35,914 in 1962, the workmen will get a total sum of Rs. 18,39,608 as bonus for that year which works out to more than 60 per cent of the available surplus.	Arguments of Petitioner

From the available surplus of Rs. 49,04,987 in 1963, the workmen will get a sum of Rs. 29,42,192 for that year which works out more or less about 60 per cent of the available surplus, falling short by a sum of Rs. 800.	Reasoning
56.	None
Mr. Malhotra, learned counsel for the appellant, attacked the method of calculation adopted by the Tribunal.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him the Tribunal should not have fixed more than 60 p.c. of the available surplus as bonus payable for a year.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, the amounts of bonus now awarded by the Tribunal and already paid by the appellant exceed 60 per cent.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our opinion, there is considerable force in the contention of the learned counsel.	Arguments of Petitioner
The available surplus, as found by the Tribunal for the year 1962 is Rs. 26,35,914.	Arguments of Petitioner
Working out roughly 60 per cent of this surplus to be distributed as bonus to the workmen, the amount of bonus will be about Rs. 15,81,600.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant had admittedly paid a sum of Rs. 14,41,455.	Arguments of Petitioner
The balance that the workmen will be entitled to will be Rs. 1,40,145.00 whereas the Tribunal has directed the appellant to pay for this year by its Award a sum of Rs. 3,98,153.	Arguments of Petitioner
The award of this amount is not justified.	Arguments of Petitioner
57.	None
So far as 1963 is concerned, the available surplus as found by the Tribunal is Rs. 49,04,987.	Reasoning
60 per cent of this available surplus, to which the workmen will be entitled to will be Rs. 29,42,992.	Reasoning
On the other hand, the total amount that the workmen will get as per the award including the amount already paid by the appellant as bonus is Rs. 29,42,192.	Reasoning
The appellant will have to pay only an additional sum of Rs. 800 to make up 60 per cent.	Reasoning
There is no appeal by the unions and therefore the bonus awarded for the year 1963 does not require any interference.	None
58.In allocating the available surplus between the company and the workmen, it has been held by this Court that it will be equitable if roughly 60 per cent of the surplus is distributed as bonus to the workmen and the Company is left with the remaining 40 per cent.	Reasoning
The Company will get in addition to this 40 per cent, the benefit of the incometax rebate on the 60 per cent bonus payable to the workmen (vide AIR 1971 SC 2567 ).	Reasoning
We have adopted the same principle in the case on hand.	Reasoning
59.	None
To conclude, the Award of the Industrial Tribunal in A.I.D. No. 6 of 1966 is set aside and Civil Appeal No. 1291 of 1967 is allowed.	Decision
There will be no order as to costs.	Decision
60.	None
The Award of the Industrial Tribunal in A.I.D. No. 8 of 1966 is modified to the following extent For the year 1962 the appellant will be liable to pay as additional bonus only a sum of Rs. 1,40,145 instead of a sum of Rs. 3,98,153 as directed by the Tribunal in the Award.	Decision
To this extent Civil Appeal No. 1292 of 1967 is allowed in part.	Decision
In other respects, it is dismissed.	Decision
There will be no order as to costs.	Decision
