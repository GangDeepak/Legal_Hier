FIRST BATCH Facts in C.A. 287/72 4.	None
The facts in the Writ Petition (S.C.A. No. 191 of 1968), from which C.A. 287/72 has arisen, are that writ petitioners 1, 4 and 6 (respondents herein) were running business in partnership under the name of The Laxmi Vijay Saw Mill from November 2, 1955 to October 31, 1959.	Facts
From November 1, 1959, writ petitioners 1 to 7 together with one Patel Muljibhai Bemjibhai, formed another partnership and executed a deed to that effect on February 1, 1960.	Facts
This partnership was dissolved on November 10, 1964.	Facts
On November 13, 1964, the Sales Tax Officer, Anand, was informed about this dissolution.	Facts
5.	None
On November 11, 1965, the Sales Tax Officer issued notices in Form No. 13 under Section 14 of the 1953 Act, requiring the erstwhile partner to showcause why they should not be assessed under Subsection (6) of Section 14 of the said Act, and why a penalty on account of their failure to get their firm registered, when they were liable to pay tax, be not imposed.	Facts
These notices covered the period from April 1, 1955 to December 31, 1959.	Facts
In reply to the notices, the respondents contended that since the old partnership formed in 1955 and the new partnership formed on November 1, 1959, had both been dissolved, the proposed action was illegal, there being no machinery under the 1953 Act to assess a dissolved firm.	Facts
A further objection was raised that the assessment proposed was timebarred.	Facts
6.	None
At this stage, the respondents moved the High Court by a petition (S.C.A. 191/68) under Article 226 of the Constitution, alleging that the turnover of the business during the relevant period, never exceeded the limit of Rs. 900/ in the past and, therefore, the question of their incurring liability to get the firm registered as a dealer and to file salestax returns under the 1959 Act, did not arise.	Facts
7.	None
During the pendency of this writ petition, on September 9, 1968, the Sales Tax Officer assessed the writpetitioners under Section 33(6) of the 1959 Act on best judgment basis, and an amount of Rs. 9,771.45 was determined as tax arrears and a further amount of Rs. 10,000/ was imposed as penalty.	Facts
A notice making demand of both these amounts was also issued on September 12, 1959.	Facts

The writ petitioner, respondent herein, is carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling wooden boxes, bamboos, timber etc.	Facts
under the name of M s. Manilal Ranchoddas at Kalol.	Facts
On June 1, 1965, he was served with a notice under Section 33(6) of the 1959 Act, by the Sales Tax Officer to show cause why he should not be assessed on bestJudgment basis for the period from January 1., 1960 to June 31, 1964 and further with penalty on account of his failure to get himself registered.	Facts
9.	None
Thereafter, on August 7, 1965, the Sales Tax Officer completed the bestJudgment assessment.	Facts
He further imposed a penalty under Section 36(2) on the assessee on account of his failure to get the firm registered as a dealer.	Facts
The assessees appeal was partly allowed by the Assessment Commissioner of Sales Tax on November 10, 1967, only so far as the question of penalty was concerned.	Facts
The assessees second appeal was dismissed by the Sales Tax Tribunal on April 28, 1969.	Facts
Facts of C.A. 290/72.	None
10.	None
The facts in writ petition (S.C.A. 8/70) giving rise to Civil Appeal 290 of 1972, are that the petitioner did not get itself registered as a dealer under the 1959 Act.	Facts
The business of the petitioner consisted of taking catering contracts from the Railway Administration.	Facts
The Sales Tax Officer served a notice, in Form No. 27 under Section 33 on March 25, 1969, requiring the writ petitioner to show cause why action be not taken against him under Section 33(6) of the 1959 Act, as applicable in the State of Gujarat, for assessing the petitioner on bestJudgment basis for the period from March 1, 1960 to February 28, 1969.	Facts
11.	None
The respondent herein sent a reply to this notice denying his liability to get himself registered as a dealer.	Facts
While the matter was still pending before the Sales Tax Officer, the respondent moved the High Court by a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, impugning the action proposed to be taken or actually taken against him under the provisions of Sections 33(6) and 36(2) of the 1959 Act. 12.	Facts
By a common judgment, dated July 8, 1970, the Gujarat High Court held that the provisions of Sections 33(6) and 35 overlap each other,, because all cases of escapement of assessment by a dealer can be dealt with at the sweet will of the assessing authority under either of these provisions that a dealer who is subjected to the procedure provided in Section 33(6) will find it more onerous than the one in Section 35 inasmuch as unlike the latter Section, no period of limitation has been provided for taking action under Section 33(6).	Facts
No guidelines have been provided and the choice of one procedure in preference to the other, is left to the arbitrary whim of the assessing authority.	Facts
On this reasoning, the High Court held that Section 33(6) offends Article 14 of the Constitution and as such is void.	Facts
In reaching this conclusion, the High Court relied mainly upon this Courts decision in Anandji Hari Das and Co. v. S.P. Kasture and Ors.	Facts
19681SCR661 .	Facts
It also drew support from this Courts decision in Ghanshyamdas v. Regional Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Nagpur 196451ITR557(SC) .	Facts

In Balmokand Jains case, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, feeling itself bound by the ratio of this Courts decision in Anandjis case (ibid), held that Section 14(6) of the Bombay Act of 1953 was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, and therefore void.	Facts
Facts in C.As. 1206 and 1213 of 1975.	Facts

These appeals by special leave arise out of a writ petition S.C.A. 444 of 1968 and Misc.	Facts
Petition 330 of 1971, filed in the High Court of Bombay, which were disposed of by that Court by its judgments, dated 11/12 October, 1971 and October 12,, 1971, respectively.	Facts
The writ petitioner respondent herein was not at any time material to the case, registered as a dealer either under the 1953 Act or under the 1959 Act.	Facts
The relevant periods of assessment are, April 1, 1956 to December 31, 1959, the period being covered by the 1953 Act, and January 1, 1960 to September 30, 1967, being the period covered by the 1959 Act.	Facts
On September 19, 1967, a notice under Section 14(6) of the 1953 Act was served on the respondent.	Facts
On November 22, 1967, another notice under Section 33(6) of the 1959 Act was served on him.	Facts
Thereafter on November 22, 1967, an order was made, against him in respect of the first period, levying a tax in the sum of Rs. 13,696.65 and a penalty under Section 14(7) in the sum of Rs.	Facts
4,500/.	Facts
On January 30, 1968, another assessment order was made which was in respect of the second period levying tax in the sum of Rs. 17,887/ and a penalty under Section 36(2)(a) in the sum of Rs. 300/ and under Section 36(2)(c) in the sum of Rs. 500/. 17.	Facts
In his writ petition, the respondent challenged the validity of these two assessment orders, on the ground that Section 14(6) and Section 33(6) of the aforesaid Acts of 1953 and 1959 being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, were void.	Facts
Following the ratio of this Courts decision in Anandjis case, the High Court, accepted the respondents contention and quashed the impugned assessments.	Facts
18. Learned Counsel for the appellants submits that the Gujarat High Court was in error in holding that the provisions of Sections 33(6) and 35 of the Act of 1959 overlap each other that it overlooked the fact that upon its very language, Section 33(6) is a special provision confined to an unregistered dealer who is guilty of committing the twofold violation of law indicated in that provision that the special provision by inevitable implication excludes the application of the general provision in Section 35(1) to the case of an unregistered dealer who escapes assessment on account of his failure to get himself registered and failure to file a return.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel has further submitted that Anandji Haridas is distinguishable inasmuch as that was a case of a registered dealer.	Arguments of Petitioner
While all the instant cases out of which these appeals have arisen, are of unregistered dealers of the category specified in Section 33(6).	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that putting unregistered dealers who escape assessment by the modus operandi mentioned in Section 33(6), in a separate class to be dealt with, under that provision, rests on rational criteria having a direct nexus with the object of preventing tax evasion.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to Mr. Bhandare, the procedure provided in Section 33(6) is not more onerous than the one prescribed for taking action under Section 35.	Arguments of Petitioner
Taxevasion, proceeds the argument, by the modus operandi of the kind stated in Section 33(6), is of a more sinister kind and may go on for years an end without detection.	Arguments of Petitioner
That is why, says the counsel, no limitation is provided for taking action under Section 33(6).	Arguments of Petitioner
19.	None
On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondents have substantially reiterated the same reasons in support of the judgments under appeal, which have been given by the High Courts.	Arguments of Respondent
20.	None
Before dealing with these contentions, it is necessary to notice the material provisions of the 1959 Act and the 1953 Act.	None
Subsection (5) of Section 2 of 1959 Act defines an unauthorised dealer to mean a registered dealer who holds an Authorisation.	None
Authorisation means an authorisation granted under Section 24.	Reasoning
Dealer under Subsection (6) of the same Section is defined to mean any person who carries on the business of selling or buying goods in the preReorganisation State of Bombay, excluding the transferred territories, whether for commission, remuneration or otherwise and includes a State Government which carries on such business and any society, club or association which sells goods to or buys goods from its members.	Reasoning
Then, there is an Exception appended to this definition which excludes an agriculturist who sells exclusively agricultural produce grown on land cultivated by him personally, from the definition.	Reasoning
21.	None
The definition of Dealer in Section 2(6) of the 1953 Act is substantially the same.	Reasoning
22. Subsection (i) of Section 22 of the 1959 Act requires that no dealer shall, while being liable to pay tax, carry on business as a dealer unless he possesses a valid certificate of registration under this Act.	None
Subsection (2) obligates every dealer who is liable to pay tax to apply for a certificate of registration in the prescribed manner to the prescribed authority within the prescribed time.	None
23.	None
Sections 33(6) and 35 of the 1959 Act read as follows Section 33(6).	None
If the Commissioner has reason to believe that a dealer is liable to pay tax in respect of any period, but has failed to apply for registration within time as required by Section 22, the Commissioner shall, after giving him a reasonable opportunity of being heard, assess, to the best of his judgment the amount of tax, if any, due from the dealer in respect of such period and any period subsequent thereto.	None
Section 35(1).	None
If the Commissioner has reason to believe that any turnover of sales or turnover of purchases of any goods chargeable to tax under this Act has in respect of any year escaped assessment, or has been underassessed or assessed at a lower rate, or that any deductions have been wrongly made, then the Commissioner may, (a) where such turnover has escaped assessment or has been underassessed or assessed at a lower rate by reason of the fact that the provisions of Subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Bombay Sales Tax (Validating Provisions) Act, 1957 were not then enacted, at any time within eight years, (b) where he has reason to believe that the dealer has concealed such sales or purchases or any material particular relating thereto, or has knowingly furnished incorrect returns, at any time within eight years, and (c) in any other case, at any time within five years of the end of the year, serve on the dealer liable to pay tax in respect of such turnover, a notice containing all or any of the requisitions which may be included in a notice under Subsection (3) of Section 33 and may proceed to assess or reassess the amount of the tax due from such dealer and accordingly, the other provision of this Act shall apply as if the notice were a notice served under that Subsection Provided that the amount of tax shall be assessed at the rates at which it would have been assessed had there been no underassessment or escapement, but after making deductions, if any, permitted from time to time by or under this Act Provided further that, where in respect of such turnover an order has already been passed in appeal or revision under this Act, the Commissioner shall make a report to the appropriate appellate or revising authority under this Act, which shall thereupon after giving the dealer concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard pass such order as it deems fit.	None
(2) Nothing in Subsection (1) shall apply to any proceeding (including any notice issued) under Section 33 or 57 or 62.	None
(3) Nothing in Section 57 or 62 shall affect a proceeding under this section.	None
24.	None
The corresponding provisions of the Act of 1953 run as under Section 14(6).	None
If upon information which has come into his possession, the Collector is satisfied that any dealer has been liable to pay the tax in respect of any period, but has failed to apply for registration, the Collector shall, after giving the dealer reasonable opportunity of being heard, assess to the best of his judgment the amount of tax, if any, due from the dealer in respect of such period and all subsequent periods.	None
Section 15.	None
If in consequence of any information which has come into his possession the Collector is satisfied that any turnover in respect of sales or purchase of any goods chargeable to the tax has escaped assessment in any year or has been under assessed or assessed at a lower rate or any deductions have been wrongly made therefrom, the Collector may, in any case where he has reason to believe that the dealer has concealed the particulars of such sales or purchases or has knowingly furnished incorrect returns, at any time within five years, and in any other case, at any time within three years, of the end of that year, serve on the dealer liable to pay the tax in respect of such turnover a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under Subsection (3) of Section 14 and may proceed to assess or reassess the amount of the tax due from such dealer and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice served under that Subsection Provided that the amount of the tax shall be assessed after making the deductions permitted from time to time under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1946, the Bombay Sales Tax (No. 2) Ordinance, 1952, and this Act, as the case may be, at the rates at which it would have been assessed had the turnover not escaped assessment or full assessment, as the case may be Provided further that where in respect of such turnover or deduction, as the case may be, an order has already been passed under Section 30 or Section 31, the Collector shall make a report to the appropriate appellate or revising authority, as the case may be, which shall thereupon after giving the dealer concerned a reasonable opportunity of being heard, pass such order as it deems fit.	None
25.	None
An analysis of Section 33(6) of the 1959 Act (corresponding to Section 14(6) of the 1953 Act) will show that it applies to tot particular class of dealers, liable to pay tax, who (i) fail to apply for registration as required by law (vide Section 22) and (ii) who fail to pay the tax in respect of any period.	Reasoning
26.	None
Thus, Section 33(6) is, in terms, restricted in its application to the case of an unregistered dealer whose modus operandi to evade tax involves ab initio disregard of the law.	Reasoning
It does not apply to a registered dealer who has escaped assessment or has been underassessed or assessed at a lower rate or has been wrongly allowed any deduction or has concealed any material particulars relating to sales or purchases or has knowingly furnished incorrect returns.	Reasoning
The case of such a registered dealer will fall under Section 35 and not under Section 33(6).	Reasoning
Section 33(6) is a special provision confined to a particular class of taxevaders, namely, unregistered dealers while Section 35 is a general provision to deal with cases of escaped assessment or under assessment.	Reasoning
Generalia specialibus non derogant is a cardinal principle of interpretation.	Reasoning
It means that the general provisions must always yield to the special provisions.	Reasoning
Construed in accordance with this fundamental principle the special class of unregistered dealers covered by Section 33(6) must be taken to have been excluded from the purview of the general provisions in Section 35.	Reasoning
Thus considered, it is clear that the case of an unregistered dealer who evades tax by committing the double default specified in Section 33(6), action can be taken only under that Section and not under Section 35.	Reasoning
27.	None
It is true that no limitation has been prescribed for taking action under Section 33(6) against an unregistered dealer falling thereunder.	Reasoning
But, there is rational basis for not putting any restriction as to the length of time within which action can be taken under Section 33(6).	Reasoning
The reason is that tax evasion by the unregistered dealers in this class because of the clandestine modus operandi adopted by them, and wholesale disregard of the law, is more contumacious in character, more sinister in its effect both on the lawabiding taxpayers and the collection of public revenue, and more difficult to detect than taxevasion by a registered dealer.	Reasoning
When a dealer applies for and obtains a registration certificate under the Act, he thereby admits his liability to pay tax.	Reasoning
In his case, the Salestax Authorities, have basic information, in pursuance of which, they can, by the exercise of due vigilance , check and detect any taxevasion by him within a reasonable time.	Reasoning
This reasonable time is the period of limitation fixed by the Legislature, in its wisdom, in Section 35.	Reasoning
But the case of a taxevading unregistered dealer is different.	Reasoning
In his case, the Authorities have on their record no such basic information such as the registration record which would supply them a lead to work upon.	Reasoning
For lack of information, or want of adequate staff, resources and time at the disposal of the Department, and the secretive nature of the modus operandi, taxevading activities of an unregistered dealer may go on undetected for years on end.	Reasoning
That is why for taking action under Section 33(6) against a taxevading unregistered dealer, the Legislature has not fixed any period of limitation.	Reasoning
Thus, putting the unregistered dealer who, though liable to pay tax, fails to get himself registered and does not pay any tax, in a separate class, to be dealt with under Section 33(6), differently from other dealers falling under Section 35, rests on intelligible differentia having a rational nexus with the object of preventing taxevasion.	Reasoning
28.	None
The question of limitation apart, it cannot be said that the procedure provided in Section 33(6) is more onerous than the one specified in Section 35.	Reasoning
The requirement as to issue of a notice to the defaulter and giving of an opportunity of being heard, is a common feature of both the sections.	Reasoning
It is true that under Section 33(6), the assessment is made on bestjudgment basis.	Reasoning
Nevertheless, it cannot be made arbitrarily or capriciously.	Reasoning
It has to be made after taking into account all relevant material gathered by the Taxation Officer or produced before him by the assessee in response to the notice.	Reasoning
If an assessment under Section 33(6) is made upon inadequate materials, but on honest and fair guesswork, then it will be but due to the deliberate default of the assessee in supplying the necessary information.	Reasoning
The differential mode of assessment under Section 33(6) is thus founded upon rational criteria.	Reasoning
29.	None
The ratio of Anandji Haridas is not applicable to the facts of the present cases.	Reasoning
Therein, this Court was dealing with the case of a registered dealer under the C.P. and Berar Sales Tax Act 1947.	Reasoning
It was in that context that this Court, by a majority of 3 to 2, held that Section 11(4)(a) of that Act was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Here we are concerned with the cases of unregistered dealers under the Bombay Act.	Reasoning
In our opinion, upon a proper construction of the two provisions, in juxtaposition to each other, such unregistered dealers can be proceeded against under Section 33(6) of the Bombay Act of 1959 or Section 14(6) of the Bombay Act of 1953, as the case may be, and not under Section 35/Section 15 of the said Acts.	Reasoning
There is no overlapping between these two, because Section 35 cannot be applied to the case of an unregistered dealer falling within the purview of the special provision in Section 33(6).	Reasoning
This was clear from Subsection (2) of Section 35, as it stood at the time material to these cases.	Reasoning
30.	None
For the foregoing reasons, we are of opinion that Section 33(6) of the 1959 Act and Section 14(6) of the 1953 Act do not violate Article 14 of the Constitution, and are valid.	Reasoning
31.	None
We may mention in passing that the question raised with regard to the constitutional validity of the aforesaid provisions has become largely academic because mostly the impugned notices or assessments were within the period of limitation prescribed for taking action under Section 35 of the 1959 Act.	Reasoning
In such cases, the question of subjecting the respondents to a more onerous procedure than the one envisaged in Section 35 in the matter of limitation, does not arise.	Reasoning
32.	None
In the result, we allow these appeals, set aside the judgment of the High Courts Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal and send the cases back to the High Court or the Tribunal concerned, with these directions 33.	Decision
In matters in which assessment orders have been passed, it will be open to the respondents to file or refile appeals against the assessment orders or if the respondents have withdrawn any appeal filed by them, they will be at liberty to file fresh appeals.	Decision
In that case, if there is delay in filing or refiling the appeals, the delay will hopefully be condoned as it is attributed to these proceedings.	Decision
The matters remitted to the High Court will be further remitted to the Salestax Officer, for disposal.	Decision
34.	None
Civil Appeals Nos. 24502451/72 (Maharashtra appeals) will go back to the Sales Tax Tribunal, for decision or merits.	Decision
35.	None
As already stated above, Civil Appeals Nos. 1213, 1206/75, 10231031/73, 2529/72 and 303/74 will also be governed by this judgment in Civil Appeals 287290 of 1972.	Decision
In all these cases, the parties are left to pay and bear their own costs in this Court.	Decision
