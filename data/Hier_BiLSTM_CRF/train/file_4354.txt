 Sarkaria, J.1.	None
Whether the principle of apportionment is applicable to the fixation of standard rent of a premises under the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (for short, the Act) if so, whether on the facts of the case, the principle has been rightly invoked  is the twofold question that falls for decision in these three appeals by special leave directed against the judgment of the High Court, of Judicature at Bombay.2.	Issue
The material facts are as underA big compound measuring 11,150 sq. yards at 156, Tardeo Road, Bombay, belonged to Raja Bahadur Moti Lal Mills Ltd., Bombay, appellant No. 1.	Facts
The Mills were shifted from these premises in the year 1930.	Facts
In 1932, the whole of this estate including the structures standing on a part of it, was let out to Sound Studios Ltd. Between the years 1932 and 1940, some part of it was sublet by Sound Studios to Sheraj Ali, who was the proprietor of M s. Famous Cine Laboratory and another part of Neon Signs (India) Ltd., and the rest of the estate continued to be with Sound Studios.	Facts
Thereafter, Sound Studios went out of the picture and the whole estate was let out to National Studios Ltd. on October 23, 1940 at a monthly rent of Rs. 1700/ for a period of two years.3.	Facts
In July, 1941, National Studios surrendered their lease and Sheraj Ali became a direct tenant under appellant 1 in respect of the premises in his possession, called for the sake of identification, 983/1 (whole) and 983/2 (Ground floor).	Facts
On December 1, 1941 and again in November, 1942, Sheraj Ali took on rent additional portions of this estate so that his original rent, which was Rs. 400/, was first increased to Rs. 600/ and then to Rupees 700/ and thereafter in November, 1942 to Rs. 875/. By November, 1947, Sheraj Ali was paying Rs. 1200/ per month as rent for the premises demised to him including some new structures which had been built.4.	Facts
Sheraj Ali had taken a loan from M s. Govind Ram Bros Ltd., Respondent 1 on the security of his Film Studio Equipments.	Facts
He failed to repay the loan.	Facts
Thereupon Respondent 1 instituted a suit for recovery of the amount and obtained a decree from the High Court on February 27, 1948.	Facts
As a result of the High Courts decree, the right, title and interest of Sheraj Ali in the mortgaged property were assigned to Respondent 1.	Facts
Respondent 1, in consequence, took a fresh lease on March 19, 1948 from appellant No. 1 of the properties (called for identification)	Facts
983/1 to 983/12, which were in the tenancy of Sheraj Ali, at a contractual rent of Rs. 1228/ p. m.	Facts
On the same date, Respondent 1 executed another lease in respect of three rooms in the same premises (marked for identification as) 984, in favour of appellant 1, on a monthly, rent of Rs.	Facts
750/. Respondent 1 failed to pay the contractual rent, regularly, which fel into arrears which were not cleared despite the pressing demands made by the Receiver.	Facts
On March 13, 1954, the Receiver wrote to Respondent 1 threatening to take legal proceedings for the recovery of the rent.	Facts
This Receiver who is now appellant No. 2, had been appointed by the High Court in Suit No. 454 of 1949 instituted by appellant 1 against the Insurance Company.5.	Facts
On April 4, 1954, two applications were failed in the Court of Small Causes by Respondent 1 for fixation of standard rent in respect of the premises comprised in the said two leases one application, R. A. N. 983/54 relates to properties 983/1 to 983/12, and the other (R.A.N.984) to premises 984.	Facts
It was alleged in the applications that since on September 1, 1940, the entire estate, including the properties in question, had been let out on a monthly rent of Rs. 1700/, standard rent of the premises in question should be fixed on the basis of apportionment.	Facts
In particular, it was pleaded that fair rent of 983/1 to 983/12 should be 1/8th of Rs. 1200/ which was later corrected as Rs. 1700/.	Facts
On the same basis it was alleged in the second application that fair rent of premises 984 should be Rs.	Facts
75/ p. m.6.	Facts
The appellants resisted these applications and averred in R.A.N. 983/54 that several entirely new structures had been built and substantial alterations made in most of these structures between the years 1940 and 1948, as a result whereof the property had lost its identity, and consequently, fair rent could not be fixed on apportionment basis.7.	Facts
On June 11, 1958, Respondent 1 made an application for amendment of the Standard Rent Application (R.A.N. 983/54) for adding an alternative ground based on the value of the land and cost of construction so that in the event of the Court holding on the preliminary issue in favour of the appellants, the standard rent could be fixed on the basis of the evaluation of the land and the construction.	Facts
This application was disallowed.8.	Facts
On July 30, 1958, Respondent 1 made on application for amendment of his R.A.N. 984/ of 1954 on lines similar to that in R.A.N. 983/54.	Facts
It was also dismissed by an order dated July 31, 1958.9.	Facts
At the stage of arguments on December 4, 1958, Respondent 1 moved another application for amendment and addition of plea that they were the owners of the structures in premises 983/10, 983/11 and 983/12.	Facts
The second amendment was not sought to be made in the other application R.A.N. 984/1954 relating to property 984.	Facts
This prayer was also declined.10.	Facts
The trial Court (Samson J.) by its judgment dated April 2, 1959, found that the premises in question on account of structural alterations had undergone such a change that they could no longer be identified with the property that existed in September, 1940 and that the mode of determining rent by apportionment was not available to the tenants.	Facts
It the result he dismissed the applications, adding there is no sufficient material to ascertain the standard rent in any other way.11.	Facts
Against those orders, Respondent 1 filed revision petition under S. 127(3) of the Act before the Revisional Court of Small Causes, Bombay, which accepted the same, set aside the order of the trial Judge, allowed the amendment and remanded both the application for fixation of fair rent to the trial Court.12.	Facts
Against this remand order, dated August 8, 1960 of the Revisional Court, the appellants preferred two Civil Revisions to the High Court of Bombay.13.	Facts
During the pendency of those revisions, the trial Court allowed the amendment and proceeded to decide the entire matter afresh.	Facts
These facts were brought to the notice of the High Court, which, however, dismissed the revision petitions by a judgment dated February 3, 1961 holding that the first Revisional Court had, in fact, remanded the entire matter for trial de novo, after rightly allowing both the amendments.14.	Facts
After the remand, the trial Court by its judgment, dated April 25, 1961 held that except 983/10, 983/11 and 983/12, which were new structures, there was no change of identity in the rest of the properties i.e. 983/1 to 983/9 that the new structures 983/10, 983/11 and 983/12 belonged to Respondent 1 who was consequently, liable to pay rent only for the land underneath that the cost of repairs of the properties 983/8 and 983/9 after they had been destroyed by fire, was mainly borne by Respondent 1, the landlords contribution being Rs. 8,500/, only.	Facts
Applying the principle of apportionment, it fixed the standard rent of the properties 983/1 to 983/12 at Rs.	Facts
400/ p.m. subject to permitted increases after 1954.15.	Facts
Regarding the premises 984 (in R.A.N.984/54) the trial Court gave a return on the investment of Rs. 40,000/ made by the landlord inclusive of the cost of structure and the value of land underneath at Rs. 30/ per sq. yard (as that of 1940) and fixed the standard rent at Rs. 386/ p.m. subject to permitted increases after 1946.16.	Facts
Aggrieved by these orders of the trial Court, appellants and Respondent 2 filed two revision applications under Sec. 129(3) to the Revisional Court of Small Causes which by its judgment dated September 30, 1964 substantially upheld the findings of the trial Court, inter alia, with the exceptions (i) that the ownership of the new structures 983/10, 983/11 and 983/12 vested in Appellant 1, who was entitled to get a fair return on that investment (ii) that the value of the land married to the new structures 983/10, 983/11 and 983/12 and 984/54 should be taken at Rs. 50/ per sq.yd.	Facts
i.e as of 1948 and not as of 1940 as had been done by the trial Court on remand.	Facts
In the result, the standard rent in RAN 983 was raised to Rs.	Facts
981/	Facts
and in RAN 984 to Rs.	Facts
411/ p.m.17.	Facts
To impugn the decision, dated September 30, 1964, of the Revisional Court, the parties preferred six Special Civil Applications under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution to the High Court.	Facts
By a common order, a learned single Judge of the High Court dismissed these applications except that he corrected some arithmetical errors and, in consequence, fixed the standard rent of properties 983/1 to 983/12 at Rs. 841.07 and that of premises 984/ 54 at Rs. 462/11 p.m.18.	Facts
It is against this decision dated 12/13th October, 1971 of the High Court that these appeals have been filed by special leave.19.	Facts
The first contention of Mr. Cooper learned Counsel for the appellants is that there is no provision in the Act which requires standard rent to be fixed on apportionment basis rather, the definition of premises in S. 5(8)(b) which speaks of part of a building set separately, read with Clause (i) of Section 5(10) and Cl.	Arguments of Petitioner
(c) of Section 11(1) with due emphasis on the article the immediately preceding the word premises in the said clauses, indicates that the standard rent would be the rent for which the suit premises were first let separately on or after the basic date i.e. September 1, 1940.	Arguments of Petitioner
If on the basic date  proceeds the argument  the premises in question did not form the subject of a separate, single demise but had been let out together with order portions of larger premises, its standard rent could not be determined on the footing of the rent payable for those different portions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance has been placed on Dhanrajgirji Narsingirji v. W. G. Ward, 27 Bom LR 877 (AIR 1925	Arguments of Petitioner

65 Bom LR 402 (AIR 1955 Bom 157 ) referred to in the judgement of the High Court.20.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Mr. Lokur learned Counsel for Respondent 1 maintains that the principle of apportionment has always been accepted by the Bombay High Court as an appropriate guide in fixing standard rent under the Act of premises which on the basic date had been let out as part of a larger entity.	Arguments of Respondent
It is pointed out that an Narayanlal Bansilal v. Venkatrao Anant Rai (1965) 67	Arguments of Respondent
Bom LR 352 a Bench of the High Court, while considering the question of standard rent in respect of another portion of the very property of the appellantMills, had invoked this principle.21.	Arguments of Respondent
Before we deal with the contentions canvassed, it will be proper to make a brief survey of the relevant provisions of the Act.22.	None
The material part of the definition of premises in S. 5(8) reads Premises means (a) any land not being used for agricultural purposes(b) any building or part of building let separately(Emphasis supplied)23.	None
Subsection (10) of the same Section defines standard rent in relation to any premises, to mean (a) where the standard rent is fixed by the Court and the Controller respectively under the Bombay Rent Restrictions Act, 1939 or the Bombay Rents, Hotel Rates and Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1944, such standard rent or(b) where the standard rent is not so fixed  subject to the provisions of section 11,(i) the rent at which premises were let on the first day of September 1940, or(ii) where they were not let on the first day of September 1940, the rent at which they were last let before that day, or(iii) where they were first let after the first day of September 1940, the rent at which they were first let, or(iv) in any of the case specified in Section 11, the rent fixed by the Court24.	None
Section 11 empowers the Rent Control to fix the standard rent at such amount, as having regard to the provisions of this Act and the circumstances of the case, the court deems just(a) where any premises are first let after the first day of September 1940, and the rent at which they are so let is in the opinion of the Court excessive or(b) where the Court is satisfied that there is no sufficient evidence to ascertain the rent at which the premises were let in any one of the cases mentioned in subclauses (i) to (iii) of clause (4) of subsection (10) of Section 5 or(c) Where by reason of the premises having been let at one time as a whole or in part and another time in parts or a whole, or for any other reasons, any difficulty arises in giving effect to this Part or(d) Where any premises have been or are let rent free or at a nominal rent or for some consideration in addition to rent or(e)	None
Where there is any dispute between the landlord and the tenant regarding the amount of standard rent.25.	None
Clause (c) read with the opening part of S. 11(1) is crucial for our purpose.26.	None
One of the primary objects of the Act is to curb exaction of extortionate rents and to stabilise the same at preWar level.	None
In achieving that object, however, it avoids a procrustean or mechanical approach.	None
While pegging the basic line to September 1, 1940.	None
It significantly subordinates standard rent by its very definition in Section 5(18)(b) to the benignant jurisdiction of the Court under S. 11 And the key words of the latter provision, into which the conscience of this antirackrenting statute is compressed, are the circumstances of the case, the Court deems just.	None
These words inhibit a rigid and ossified determination of standard rent.	None
The leave sufficient play at the joints investing the court with a wide discretion in the matter.27.	None
According to the scheme of the Act, while rent recoverable by the landlord.may, owing to permitted increases, fluctuate, the standard rent always remains fixed or stationary.28.	None
If on the basic date, the suit premises were not let out separately but were a part of the subjectmatter of a larger demise  as in the instant case  difficulty arises in giving effect to the statute.	Reasoning
Clause (c) of Section 11(1) then comes into operation.	Reasoning
To resolve the difficulty this clause and the related provisions are not to be construed in a narrow technical sense, which would stultify or defeat their object.	Reasoning
It is to be interpreted liberally in a manner which would advance the remedy, suppress the mischief and foil subtle inventions and evasions of the Act.	Reasoning
Construed in accordance with this socially relevant rule in Heydens case, the meaning of the premises having been let at one time as a whole, spoken of in this clause, can legitimately be deemed to cover the larger premises which, on the basic date, had been let as a whole and of which the suit premises was a part let out subsequently.	Reasoning
In any event, the amplitude of the phrase or any other reasons in the latter part of the clause, is wide enough to embrace cases of this kind and confers a plenary curative power on the Court.29.	Reasoning
True, that unlike the English Rent Control Act of 1920 or the later English Acts, the (Bombay) Act does not expressly speak of apportionment.	Reasoning
But the language of its relevant provisions construed consistently with the scheme and inbuilt policy of the Act, is elastic enough to permit the fixation of standard rent on apportionment basis.	Reasoning
As noticed already, Section 11(1) gives a discretion to the Court to fix such amount as standard rent as it deems just.	Reasoning
However, in exercising this discretion the Court has to pay due regard to (i) the provisions of the Act and (ii) the circumstances of the case.30.	Reasoning
Apportionment  or equal distribution of the burden of rent on every portion  is a rule of justice and good sense.	Reasoning
If the standard rent of a whole was a specific amount, it stands to reason that the standard rent of a part or subdivision of that whole should not ordinarily exceed that amount.	Reasoning
Therefore, if in the circumstances of a given case the Court feels that for securing the end of justice and giving effect to the provisions and policy of the Act, it is reasonably necessary and feasible to work out the standard rent by apportionment, it can legitimately do so.	Reasoning
This principle, however, is applicable where on the basic date, that portion of which the standard rent is to be determined, had not been let separately as one unit, but the whole of which it is a part, had been let on that date.	Reasoning
Apportionment postulates that on account of its having been let on the basic date, the whole had acquired a standard rent which has to be allocated to smaller units subsequently carved out of it.31.	Reasoning
It is thus clear that the principle of apportionment is not alien to the spirit of the Act, and has indeed been often invoked by the courts in fixing standard rent under this Act.	Reasoning
In Narayanlal Bansilals case (1965) 67	Reasoning
Bom LR 352 (supra), a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court determined standard rent of another part of this very estate of the Mills in accordance with that principle.32.	Reasoning
However, while conceding that apportionment is not foreign to the scheme purpose and policy of the Act, we will like to emphasis the need for caution and circumspection in invoking it.	Reasoning
It is not to be rigidly and indiscriminately applied as a castiron rule of law regardless of time and circumstances or the equities of the case.	Reasoning
A doctrinnaire approach, not consistent with a just and fair determination, stultifies the whole salutary purpose of justice to both the landlord and the tenant.	Reasoning
If necessary, it can be adjusted, adapted and attuned in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, to satisfy the statutory requirement of fixing the standard rent at a just amount.	Reasoning
Thus, if after the material date, the landlord has made investments and improvements in the premises, it will be just and reasonable to take that factor also into account and to give him a fair return on such investments.	Reasoning
Further, in apportioning the rent, the Court must consider other relevant circumstances, such as size, accessibility, aspect and other physical advantages enjoyed by the tenant of the premises of which the standard rent is in question, as compared with those of the rest of the property in which it is comprised (see Bainbridge v. Congdon (1925) 2 KB 261).	Reasoning
Where after the basic date, the premises completely change their identity, apportionment as a method of determining just standard rent, loses its efficacy and may be abandoned altogether.	Reasoning
We have only illustrated, not exhaustively enumerated the relevant circumstances and their implications.33.	Reasoning
At this stage, we may notice the decisions in 27 Bom LR 877 (AIR 1925 Bom 400 ) (supra) and Bata Show and Co. v. Narayan Dass, AIR 1953 Cal 243 (supra) relied upon by Mr. Cooper.34.	None
In the first, a learned single Judge of the Bombay High Court was considering Sections 2(1)(a) and 13(1)(a) of the Bombay Rent (War Restriction Act) (Act II of 1918), which were, to an extent, similar to Ss. 5(8) (b) and (10) and 11(1)(c) of the 1947 Act.	None
There, the Port Trust had in March 24, 1915, leased the building known as Watsons Annexe to one Dr. Billimoria at a rental of Rs. 2,850, besides ground rent and taxes.	None
Dr. Billimoria sublet the premises in different flat to different tenants.	None
The premises in the occupation of the defendant were sublet to him at a rental of Rs. 75/ in September, 1915, i.e. before September 1, 1916 which was the basic date under the 1918 Act.	None
The tenancy of Dr. Billimoria was terminated by a consent decree on July 31, 1923 and thereafter, the defendant held directly under the plaintiff.	None
The questions arose as to whether standard rental of the flat should be calculated on the basis of the actual rent of Rs. 75/, on the basis of the subletting, or whether it should be determined by apportionment of the rent which Dr. Billimoria was paying to the Port Trust on the basis of the first letting.	None
Pratt J. answered this question thusThe Rent Act itself in the definition of the premises refers to a part of the building separately let us premises of which the standard rent has to be determined and such standard rent must be determined with reference to those premises in the manner specified by Section 2(1) (a) of the Act.	None
The standard rent, therefore, must be ascertained on the admitted basic rent of Rs. 75	None
Again, if the headlease instead of being as here the lease of one building consisting of flats had been a lease of a large number of buildings constituting a large estate, it would be almost impossible to make a correct apportionment of the rent.	None
I do not think it was the intention of the Rent Act that landlords and tenants should be driven to do a difficult and expensive process of valuation and calculation before their rent could be ascertained.35.	None
We see force in the argument as also textual and pragmatic support.	Reasoning
But these considerations do not preclude the Court from importing the flexible factors of fairness suggested by the circumstances of the case.	Reasoning
Indeed Section 11, as explained earlier, obliges the Court to do it.	Reasoning
Moreover, the interpretation of premises adopted by the learned Judge was a little too literal, narrow and divorced from the purpose and content of the provisions relating to fixation of standard rent.	Reasoning
Nor was it in accord with the scheme and object of the 1918 Act.	Reasoning
The Courts jurisdiction to consider, as a strong circumstances, proper apportionment of rent is not taken away, in our view.36.	Reasoning
It may be noted that just like the opening clause of S. 5 of the 1947 Act, which defines premises standard rent etc., the corresponding S. 2(1) of the 1918 Act, also, started with the qualifying words In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context.	None
While applying these definitions to particular cases and provisions of the Act, these words should not be lost sight of.	None
The argument in favour of adopting the restricted interpretation, ignores this rider to the definitions, provided by the Legislature in these statutes.37.	None
We do not intend to overburden this judgement with a discussion of the decision in Bata Shoe and Co.s case AIR 1953 Cal 234 (supra) Suffice it to say that that is a decision under the West Bengal Premises Rent Control Act (17 of 1950) which stands on its own facts.	None
It cannot be accepted as laying down a rule of universal application.	None
It is, vulnerable, more or less on the same grounds, on which the decision in Dhanrajgirjis case, 27 Bom LR 877 (AIR 1925 Bom 400 ) can be assailed.38.	None
We reject the narrow interpretation of the relevant provisions of Sections 2 and 11, canvassed for by the appellants, for two reasons Firstly, it will leave the door wide open for evasion of this statute by what Abbot C. J. in Fox v. Bishop of Chester, (1824) 2 B and C 635 at p. 655  called shift or contrivance.	Reasoning
All that a greedy landlord need do to squeeze out more rent would be to divide his premises into several parts and let them out separately on exorbitant rents.	Reasoning
Such an evasion may amount to a fraud upon the statute.	Reasoning
Secondly, such a construction, so manifestly subversive of one of the primary objects of the Act, would be wholly beyond the intendment of the Legislature.39.	Reasoning
For reasons aforesaid we would negative the first contention of Mr. Cooper, as an inflexible proposition and answer the first part of the question posed in the affirmative to the extent indicated.	Reasoning
It takes us tot he second part of that question, namely, whether the principle of apportionment was correctly applied to the facts of the case?40.	None
Mr. Cooper contends that the first trial court (Samson, J.) had rightly found that the premises in question on account of extensive alterations and constructions had undergone a complete change after the basic date, and therefore, standard rent could not be determined by apportioning the rent of the whole among the parts.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is maintained that this finding of Samson J. was wrongly set aside by the High Court and must be deemed to be still holding the field.	Arguments of Petitioner
Objection is also taken to the amendments allowed by the trial court on remand.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the alternative, it is argued that even the courts below found that properties 986/10, 983/11, 983/12 and 984/54 were admittedly new structures and extensive repairs and replacements had been made in the remaining premises which had been destroyed or severely damaged by fire in 194849.	Arguments of Petitioner
On account of these substantial alterations and reconstructions, the premises in question had lost their identity and consequently, the principle of apportionment was not applicable.41.	None
The first part of the contention based on the judgment of Samson J. is groundless.	None
The judgment of the first trial court was set aside in toto by the Revisional Court, and further by the High Court and the case was remanded for de novo trial to the trial court which therefore, decided the case afresh after allowing the applicant to amend his R.A.Ns.	Reasoning
It is too late in the day any way to argue on the assumption that the findings still survive.42.	None
The question whether a certain property has changed its identity after the basic date is largely one of fact.	None
The courts below have found that excepting properties 983/10, 983/11, 983/12 and 984/54 which were admittedly new structures construed near about 1948, the rest of the properties, namley 983/1 to 983/9 had not lost their identity.	Reasoning
The courts therefore, worked out the economic rent of these new structures by capitalisign their value and gave the landlord a fair return on his investments and fixed their standard rent mainly on that basis.	Reasoning
It was with regard to the unchanged old properties 983/1 to 983/9 that the High Court and the Revisional Court mainly adopted the method of apportionment.	Reasoning
Even so, it allowed the landlord fair return over Rs. 14,448/ being the cost of flooring, ceiling and other fixtures fixed to property 983/6.	Reasoning
Now it is disputed that on the basic date (September 1, 1940), these properties in question were parts of a larger entity comprised in a single lease or tenancy in favour of Sound Studios at a monthly rent of Rs.	Reasoning
1,700/.	None
The courts below have therefore taken into account this basic circumstance along with the other relevant facts of the case.	Reasoning
We do not find anything so wrong or unfair or untenable in the method adopted by them which would warrant an interference by this Court in exercise of its special jurisdiction under Art. 136 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Not that apportionment must be applied in all cases as a rule of law but that, if applied along with other consideration dictated by a sense of justice and fairplay cannot be condemned by this court as illegal.	Reasoning
We therefore, overrule this contention, also.43.	None
Lastly, it is contended that the courts below have seriously erred in evaluating the land under the suit properties at Rs. 30/ per sq. yd.	Arguments of Petitioner
on the basis of an instance (Ex. R. 6) of the year 1942, while they should have taken into account the value of the land as in the year 1948.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is added that some photostat copies of saledeeds pertaining to the relevant year were produced by Mr. Deweja, architect examinsional Court wrongly rejected them as unproved.	Reasoning
It is maintained that in 1948, the market value of the site underneath the structures was Rs. 120/ per sq. yd.	Reasoning
In support of his contention that the value of the land at the date of the letting is the appropriate value to be taken into account.	Reasoning
Counsel has cited  Rukmanibai Khunji Cooverji v. Shivnarayan Ram Ashre, (1965) 67	Arguments of Petitioner
Bom LR 692.44.	Arguments of Petitioner
We are unable to accept this contention also.	Reasoning
The courts below in capitalising the structures, 983/10 to 983/12 and 984/54, did take into account the value of the land married to those properties at the rate of Rs. 50/ per se. yd.	Reasoning
which, according to their estimate, after adding Rs. 30/ per sq. yd	Reasoning
.	None
for escalation, would be the market value of that land in the year 1948.	Reasoning
Since the rent of the old unchanged properties 983/1 to 983/9 was fixed mainly on apportionment basis, the courts did not think it necessary to take the value of their sites separately into computation in fixing the standard rent.	Reasoning
Moreover, there was no evidence on the record to show that the value of the land in question, in the year 1948 was Rs. 120/ per sq. yd.	Reasoning
We therefore, do not think it necessary to examine Cooverjis case, (1965)	Reasoning
Bom LR 692 cited by the Counsel.	Reasoning
We however, do not rule out the propriety of paying regard to escalations in land value as put forward by Mr. Cooper, but do hold that this Court will be loath to reinvestigate factul conclusions not shown to be perverse or manifestly unjust.	Reasoning
Such is not the case here.45.	None
For all the foregoing reasons, we would answer the question posed for decision, in the affirmative and dismiss these appeals with one set of costs.46.	Decision
Appeals dismissed.	None
