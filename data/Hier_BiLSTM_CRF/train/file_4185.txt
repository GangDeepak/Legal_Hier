 Hegde, J.1.	None
The appellantfirm are wine merchants, carrying on business at the Mall in Simla.	Facts
In the auction for sale of the Indian made foreign liquor and beer held on March 31, 1967, the appellant was the highest bidder for dealing in liquor under a L2 licence as provided in the Punjab Liquor Licence Rules as applicable to certain parts of the then Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh.	Facts
The case for the appellant is that at the time of the auction, Deputy Commissioner, Simla who is also the Collector of Excise and Taxation, announced that no sales tax will be liable to be paid on the sale of the India made foreign liquor and beer but deposite this assurance the Government has levied and collected from the appellantfirm a sum of Rs. 26,79826 P. and further it is taking steps against the firm for realising sales tax on the liquor and beer sold by it.	Facts
Hence it filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court (Himachal Pradesh Bench at Simla) seeking various reliefs.	Facts
Several contentions were taken in the writ petition but at the time of the hearing only one of the reliefs prayed for in the writ petition was pressed.	Facts
Many of the contentions taken in the writ petition were given up.	Facts
Hence it is not necessary for us to refer to the facts relating to the other reliefs prayed for in the writ petition.	Facts
The appellant pleaded that in view of the representation made by the Deputy Commissioner, it was induced to increase its bid as a result of which the Government had substantially benefited.	Facts
The case for the appellant is that because of the equities of the case, the Court should issue a writ, direction or order restraining the respondents from enforcing the levy of sales tax on the sales of Indian made foreign liquor and beer at Simla.2.	Facts
In the counteraffidavit filed on behalf of the respondents, it was denied that the Deputy Commissioner had represented to the bidders before the auction commenced that no sales tax was liable to be paid on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor or beer.	Facts
The case of the respondents is that all that the Deputy Commissioner told the bidders was that the Government was considering the question of removing sales tax on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor.	Facts
In fact, the Himachal Pradesh Government took a decision to remove sales tax on sale of Indian made foreign liquor	Facts
but they could not enforce that decision without approval of the Union Government the Union Government did not accord the approval asked for hence the Government was not able to remove the sales tax in respect of the sale of Indian made foreign liquor.	Facts
It was urged on behalf of the respondents that sales tax was imposed by law.	Arguments of Respondent
The Government cannot refuse to implement the mandate of the law.	Arguments of Respondent
Any change in the provisions of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act could be effected only according to the provisions of the law in force.	Arguments of Respondent
No Court can issue a mandate to a legislature or to a subordinate legislative body to make or change any law further the Himachal Pradesh Government is incompetent to change the law without the approval of the Union Government which is not a party to the writ petition.3.	Arguments of Respondent
The first question that we have to decide it as to what was the representation made by the Deputy Commissioner at the time of the auction.	Issue
As seen earlier the parties are not agreed on this joint.	Issue
The relevant allegation in the writ petition is found in paragraph 3 thereof.	None
It reads it was also announced that no sales tax would be liable to be paid on the sales of Indian made foreign liquor and beer4.	None
This statement does not show that.	None
the Deputy Commissioner gave an assurance to the bidders that the Himachal Pradesh Government had decided to abolish sale tax on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor or beer.	None
If the statement in the writ petition is correct, the Deputy Commissioner merely gave a wrong interpretation of the law.	None
Apart from, that, as mentioned earlier, it was denied on behalf of the respondents that the Deputy Commissioner had made such a representation.	None
According to them all that the Deputy Commissioner stated at that time was that the Government was considering to abolish the tax on the line of Haryana Government.	None
Barring asserting that the Deputy Commissioner had made a representation that no sales tax would be liable on the sales of Indian made foreign liquor and beer, the appellant has produced no material in support of that assertion.	None
It appears from the letter written by the Secretary, Excise to Government of Himachal Pradesh to the Deputy Secretary, Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs on June 24, 1967 and from the letter written by the Chief Secretary to the Himachal Pradesh Government to the Additional Secretary (U. T.) to the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs on January 16, 1968 that the Government of Himachal Pradesh wanted to bring their sales tax laws relating to the sale of Indian made foreign liquor in line with the law in force in Haryana State.	Reasoning
But it is clear from those letters that the Himachal Pradesh Government was of the opinion that it could not do so without the concurrence of the Central Government.	Reasoning
Whether the Himachal Pradesh Government was competent to alter the Sales Tax Law as desired by it without the concurrence of the Central Government, as contended on behalf of the appellant or whether it could do so only with the concurrence of the Central Government, as contended on behalf of the respondents, the fact remains that the Government of Himachal Pradesh was of the opinion that it could not alter the law without the concurrence of the Central Government.	Reasoning
That being so, it is difficult to accept the contention of the appellant that the Deputy Commissioner had represented that the Himachal Pradesh Government had decided to remove sales tax on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor.	Reasoning
The only thing which the Deputy Commissioner could have announced was that the Himachal Pradesh Government was considering the abolition of the tax in question.	Reasoning
The learned single judge who heard the writ petition came to conclusion that there is no positive evidence on record to support the contention that this announcement that the Government of Himachal Pradesh had decided to remove sales tax on sale of Indian made foreign liquor) was actually made by the Collector conducting the auction as a condition of the auction.	Reasoning
Before coming to this conclusion, the learned single judge had considered all the relevant material bearing on the point.	Reasoning
But the Division Bench while hearing the appeal of the appellant did not analyse the evidence bearing on the point nor did it consider the effect of the material before it.	Reasoning
It held it is clear from the admission contained in paragraph 2 of the letter dated the 16th of January 1968, that there was some announcement on the 31st of March, 1967, when the auction was held and it was not an ambiguous announcement.	Reasoning
It was presumably specific to the effect that either the Government of Himachal Pradesh bad decided to abolish the sales tax or that they were going to achieve its abolition in respect of the merged areas.	Reasoning
This is at best a speculative conclusion.5.	Reasoning
Our attention has not been invited to any material on record on the basis of which that conclusion could have been arrived at by the Division Bench.	Reasoning
The two letters referred to earlier do not support that conclusion.	Reasoning
The averment in the writ petition, as seen earlier does not accord with the case taken at the time of the arguments.	Reasoning
The Government has denied that the Deputy commissioner had either been authorised or be had made the representation at the time of the auction that the Government had decided to abolish the sales tax on sale of Indian made foreign liquor.	Reasoning
According to the respondents, all that the Deputy commissioner had represented to the bidders was that the Government was considering the abolition of the sales tax on sale of Indian made foreign liquor such a representation cannot be considered as a condition of the auction, assuming that such a condition can be imposed orally by the Deputy Commissioner.	Reasoning
Hence in our opinion the Division Bench erred in its conclusion about the alleged representation by the Deputy Commissioner.6.	Reasoning
This finding alone is sufficient to dismiss the appeal but as Mr. Sibbal, learned counsel or the appellant has elaborately argued the question of law to which we shall presently refer, we shall examine the same.7.	None
Simla was a part of Punjab till reorganisation of Punjab in 1966.	None
Simla and two other districts of the former State of Punjab were added on to the Union Territory of Himachal Pradesh under the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966.	None
Under the provisions of that Act, the laws in force, immediately before the appointed day namely October 1, 1966, in those districts were to continue in operation till the appropriate legislature or competent authority altered the same.	None
One of the laws that was in force in those areas is the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948.	None
Section 6 (1) of that Act providesNo tax shall be payable on the sale of goods specified in the first column of Schedule B subject to the conditions and exceptions, if any, set out in the corresponding entry in the second column thereof and no dealer shall charge sales tax on the sale of goods which are declared taxfree under this section.	None
Till August 31, 1966, Indian made foreign liquor was in Schedule B.	None
But on that date the Government of Punjab in exercise of its powers conferred under proviso to Section 5 deleted Indian made foreign liquor from Schedule B and included the same in Schedule A to that Act.	Reasoning
Thus the sale of the said liquor became eligible to sales tax.	Reasoning
This was the law in force in Punjab when reorganisation took place.	Reasoning
Hence Simla and other areas which were formerly parts of the state of undivided Punjab continued to be governed by that law even after reorganisation.	Reasoning
Our attention has not been drawn to any provision in that Act empowering the Government to exempt any assessee from payment of tax.	Reasoning
Therefore it is clear that the appellant was liable to pay the tax imposed under the law.	Reasoning
What the appellant really wants is a mandate from the court to the competent authority to delete the concerned entry from Schedule A and include the same in Schedule B.	Reasoning
We shall not go into the question whether the Government of Himachal Pradesh on its own authority was competent to make the alteration in question or not.	Reasoning
We shall assume for our present purpose that it had such a power.	Reasoning
The power to impose a tax is undoubtedly a legislative power.	Reasoning
That can be exercised by the legislature directly or subject to certain conditions, the legislature may delegate that power to some other authority.	Reasoning
But the exercise of that power, whether by the legislature or by its delegate is an exercise of a legislative power.	Reasoning
The fact that the power was delegated to the executive does not convert that power into an executive or administrative power.	Reasoning
No court can issue a mandate to a legislature to enact a particular law.	Reasoning
Similarly no court can direct a subordinate legislative body to enact or not to enact a law which it may be competent to enact.	Reasoning
The relief as framed by the appellant in his writ petition does not bring out the real issue calling for determination.	Reasoning
In reality he wants this court to direct the Government to delete the entry in question from Schedule A and include the same in Schedule B. Article 265 of the constitution lays down that no tax can be levied and collected except by authority of law.	Reasoning
Hence the levy of a tax can only be done by the authority of law and not by any executive order.	Reasoning
unless the executive is specifically empowered by law to give any exemption, it cannot say that it will not enforce the law as against a particular person.	Reasoning
No court can give a direction to a Government to refrain from enforcing a provision of law.	Reasoning
Under these circumstances, we must bold that the relief asked for by the appellant cannot be granted.8.	Reasoning
In support of its contention, the appellant relied on two decisions of this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
The first is collector of Bombay v. Municipal corporation of the City of Bombay, 1952 SCR 43 (AIR 1951 SC 469 ).	Arguments of Petitioner
The facts of that case are as follows9.	None
In 1865, the Government of Bombay called upon the predecessor in title of the Corporation of Bombay to remove some markets from a certain site and vacate it.	None
On the application of the then Municipal Commissioner, the Government passed a resolution approving and authorising the grant of another site to the Municipality for the purpose of running a market.	None
The resolution passed by the Government stated further that the Government do not consider that any rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets will be, like other public buildings, for the benefit of the whole community.	None
The Corporation gave up the sites on which the old markets were situated and spent a sum of over 17 lacs in erecting and maintaining markets on new site.	None
It continued to be in possession of the site in question without paying any rent, openly and to the knowledge of Government for a period of seventy years.	None
In 1940 the Collector of Bombay, overruling the objection of the Corporation, assessed the new site under Section 8 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act to land revenue rising from Rupees 7,500/ to Rs. 30,000/ in 50 years.	None
The Corporation sued for a declaration that the order of assessment was ultra vires and that it was entitled to hold the land for ever without payment of any landrevenue.	None
The High Court of Bombay held that the Government has lost its right to levy land revenue on the land in question by reason of the equity arising, in favour of the Corporation.	None
By a majority, this Court affirmed the decision of the Bombay High Court.	None
Therein this Court was not called upon to issue a mandate to alter any law.10.	None
Section 8 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act providesIt shall be the duty of the Collector, subject to the orders of the.	None
Provincial Government, to fix and to levy the assessment for land revenue.	None
Where there is no right on the part of the superior holder in limitation of the right of the Provincial Government to assess, the assessment shall be fixed at the discretion of the Collector subject to the control of the Provincial Government.	None
When there is a right on the part of the superior holder in limitation of the right of the Provincial Government, in consequence of a specific limit to assessment having been established and preserved, the assessment shall not exceed such specific limit.11.	None
Section 8 did not impose any land revenue.	None
It only imposed a duty on the Collector to fix and to levy the assessment.	None
Power to levy land revenue was the prerogative of the Government.	None
The Court held that in view of the seventy years possession of the land by the Corporation openly and in assertion of a right to hold that land free of rent, it had acquired an adverse title to the property though the right acquired was a limited one.	None
This is what the court observed (p. 52 of the report)Such possession being not referable to any the title it was prima facie adverse to the legal title of the Government as owner of the land from the very moment the predecessor in title of the respondent Corporation took possession of the land under an invalid grant.	None
This possession was continued, openly as of right, uninterruptedly for over 70 years and the respondent Corporation had acquired the limited title in it and its predecessor in title had been prescribing during all this period, that is to say, the right to old the land in perpetuity free from rent but only for the purpose of a market in terms of the Government resolution of 1865.	None
The immunity from the liability to pay rent is just as much an integral part of an inseverable incident of the title so acquired, as is the obligation to hold the land for the purposes of market and for no other purpose.12.	None
From these observations, it is clear that in that case the court was only considering the relationship between a landlord and a tenant.	Reasoning
It was sought to be argued in that case that even if the Government be precluded from enhancing the rent in view of the terms of the Government Resolution it cannot be held to have disentitled itself from the prerogative right to assess land revenue.	Reasoning
The Court refused to entertain that plea as it was not raised in the written statement, nor made the subjectmatter of an issue on which the parties went to trial.	Reasoning
Hence the ratio of that decision has no relevance for our present purpose.13.	None
The other decision relied upon by the appellant is Union of India v. M s. Anglo Afghan Agencies Ltd., (1968) 2	None
SCR 366 (AIR 1968 SC 718 ).	None
Therein in exercise of the powers conferred on the Government under Section 3 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947, the Central Government issued the Imports (Control) Order, 1955 and other orders setting out the policy governing the grant of import and export licences.	None
The Central Government also evolved an Import Trade Policy to facilitate the mechanism of the Act and the orders issued thereunder.	None
The scheme was modified from time to time by issuing fresh schemes in respect of new commodities.	None
In 1962, the Central Government promulgated the Export Promotion Scheme providing incentives to exporters of woollentextiles and goods.	None
It provided for the grant to an exporter, certificates to import raw materias of a total amount equal to 100 per cent of the F. O. B. value of his exports.	None
Clause 10 of the Scheme provided that the Textile Commissioner could grant an import certificate for a lesser amount if he is satisfied, after holding an enquiry, that the declared value of the goods exported was higher that the real value of the goods.	None
The Scheme was extended to exports of woollen textiles and goods to Afghanistan.	None
The Textile commissioner without holding an enquiry as required by clause 10 of the scheme, arbitrarily reduced the import quota of some of the exporters on the basis of some private enquiry.	None
One such exporter moved the High court for the issuance of a writ to the Government to abide by the terms of the scheme, on behalf of the Government, it was urged that the scheme contained only administrative instructions and the Government was competent to change the scheme depending upon the exigencies of situation.	None
On facts this Court came to the conclusion that the scheme was not changed because of any exigencies of situation and the import quota of some of the exporters was reduced on the basis of some private enquiry.	Reasoning
Under those circumstances this Court held that the Government was bound by the representation that it made regarding the quota to which the exporters were entitled to under the scheme.	Reasoning
The ratio of that decision again cannot have any bearing on the point under consideration.	Reasoning
So long as that scheme was in force, the Government was bound to implement the same.	Reasoning
This Court did not hold that the Government was not competent to change the scheme.	Reasoning
If the scheme had statutory force, it bound the Government as much as it bound the exporters.	Reasoning
In that event the court was competent to compel the Government to act according to the scheme.	Reasoning
If on the other hand the scheme contained merely administrative instructions then the Government having made the representation referred to earlier, on the basis of which the exporters had exported certain goods, the Government was estopped from going back on the representation made by it.	Reasoning
In this case, again, there was no question of issuing any direction to make a law or abrogate an existing law.14.	Reasoning
For the reasons mentioned above this appeal fails.	Decision
But in the circumstances of the case, we think this is eminently a fit case where the parties should be asked to bear their own costs both before the High court as well as in this Court.	Decision
There is no doubt that the Deputy Commissioner did give an impression to the bidders that the Government was considering the abolition of sales tax on the sale of Indian made foreign liquor.	Decision
Relying on that information the bidders must have given very high bids.	Decision
The Government of Himachal Pradesh tried its best to persuade the Central Government to agree to change the law but it failed.	Decision
In the process, the appellant must have suffered financially.	Decision
That being so, we order this appeal to be dismissed but at the same time direct the parties to bear their own costs both in this Court as well as in the High court.15.	Decision
Appeal dismissed.	None
