Facts
The accused was also sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year for the offence under Section 324 of IPC.	Facts
Both the sentences were however directed to run concurrently.	Facts
The main reasons given by the trail court for maintaining the conviction against the appellantaccused are That the motive concerning the verbal spat between the accused and the deceased Sakthivel is proved by PW1, PW6, PW8 and PW7.ii.	Facts
That the delay was sufficiently explained, as the police were busy in conducting investigation in other case.iii.	Facts
That the recovered objects from the scene of crime has been proved before the court.iv.	Facts
That the injury on the accused has been attributed to a scuffle between the deceased and the crowd, which stands corroborated by the witness, statement of PW2, PW3 and PW5.v.	Facts
The trial recognizes that there were no step taken to identify the injury on the accused.vi.	Facts
That the mere wrong entry of timing in the inquest report, would not vitiate the post mortem report much less the prosecution case itself.vii.	Facts

That the case was proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.	None
Aggrieved, the accusedappellant approached the High Court.	None
By the impugned order, the High Court dismissed the appeal of the accused on the following grounds That the contention of the defense concerning the statement of the PW2 about recording by the police, just after the incident is a flimsy contradiction, which does not have the force to dislodge the entire case.ii.	None
That PW2s cross examination after recalling the witness, cannot be taken into consideration.iii.	None
That failure to provide reasons for the injuries sustained by the accused, would not be sufficient to dislodge the prosecutions case.iv.	Facts
That the nature of weapon and the injury would not mandate reduction in the sentence from the charge of murder to grievous injury.	Facts
Aggrieved, by the concurrent finding of the fact, the accused has approached this court.7.	Facts
The main thrust of argument by the learned counsel for the appellant is that the entire prosecution case is a fabricated in such a way so as to implicate the appellant in the case as culprit.	Arguments of Petitioner
The real circumstances of the case have been concealed by the prosecution in order to help the complainant.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even the motive projected by the prosecution is false.	Arguments of Petitioner
There was no complaint lodged by the deceased or his wife against the accused, which itself proves that the motive ascribed to be the alleged verbal spat between the deceased and accused at the drama in the village on the eve of Kaliamman temple festival.	Arguments of Petitioner
Secondly, there was huge delay in registering the FIR and the delay was caused only to implicate the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the fateful day i.e. 20.8.2009 at about 623 P.M. police got the information about the occurrence, but no FIR was lodged.	Arguments of Petitioner
At about 730 P.M. police visited the spot, conducted enquiry, suspected PWs 1 to 3 to be the real culprits and took them into their custody.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even PW2 informed police that he received injuries due to the attack made by the deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant has also injured in the fight at the hands of deceased.	Arguments of Petitioner
But, police did not register the complaint on the basis of actual occurrence, and the courts below failed to appreciate the true aspects of the case particularly nonexplanation by the prosecution as to the injuries sustained by the accused.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thereafter, the accusedappellant and deceased were sent to the hospital in same ambulance and till the discharge of the appellant from hospital, police did not suspect him as a culprit.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is only thereafter, police in connivance with complainant cooked up a case against the appellant, the complaint was suitably prepared and FIR (Ext. P1) registered.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even at the time of framing charges against the accused a charge under Section, 323, IPC was first charged but the trial Court convicted the appellant under Section 324, IPC.	Arguments of Petitioner
The trial Court as well as the High Court failed to notice the suppression of facts by the prosecution and came to a wrong conclusion without appreciating the evidence in accordance with settled principles of law, and thereby rendered a perverse judgment which is required to be set aside by the interference of this Court.8.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, learned counsel for the State supported the view taken by the Courts below and submitted that having regard to the facts and circumstances, the trial Court assessed them in proper perspective and delivered a reasoned judgment.	Arguments of Respondent
The conviction and sentence passed against the accused has also been affirmed by the High Court by categorical findings which does not require interference of this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Having heard learned counsels for both parties, we acknowledge that this case is a direct evidence case and based on statement of eyewitnesses which mandates us to observe statements of certain eye witnesses for the disposal of this case at hand.	None

We have also gone through the statements of PWs 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 22 etc.	None
Most of them are hearsay witnesses and nothing important seem to come out from their depositions.	None
Contrary to what RajendranComplainant (PW1) deposed, a combined reading of the evidences adduced by PWs 2, 3, 5, 15, 19 and 20 would make it abundantly clear that both the accused and the deceased have participated in the fight with wooden logs, accused has got head injury at the hands of deceased, PW2 (Arumugham) himself also received injury at the hands of accused while he was trying to protect PW1 (Rajendran) from the assault of the accused, police reached the place of occurrence within ten minutes of the occurrence, that is well before the arrival of ambulance and RajendranPW1 (complainant), Arumugham Ayyar (PW2), Subramanian (PW3) and other witnesses described the incident to the police who then examined the persons present there, rough sketch was prepared and their signatures were also obtained.	Reasoning
Having observed the various depositions, we are of the considered opinion that there are four crucial aspects herein, which should be discussed and elaborated upon.	None
The above evidence if examined from the perspective of time, the overall impression that can be drawn from the foregoing discussion is that the occurrence took place at around 6.15 p.m., and the Head Constable Mohan (PW20) received information of occurrence at 623 P.M. and he passed on the message to SubInspector and Circle Inspector at 626 P.M., soon thereafter ambulance arrived at the spot of occurrence at 6.30 p.m.	None
At that point of time, Police have enquired PW1, PW2 and other witnesses, drawn report, sketch map etc., and took their signatures and sent the injured persons to hospital.	None
That sequence of incidents shows that already investigation was started by police.	None
That means the information provided by PWs 1, 2 and other witnesses at about 630 P.M. at the place of occurrence should have ideally been the basis of the F.I.R. Whereas the F.I.R. (Ext.P1) shows that the information was received at police station at 9.30 p.m. on 20 th August, 2009.	None
We may note that this case involves a fight between two personsaccused and the deceased.	None
Majority of the eye witnesses including PW1, PW3, have categorically stated that accusedappellant was the aggressor.	None
Interestingly, the PW2 states that, even the Sakthivel assaulted the accused by a wooden log on the head, his statement should be given credence for eight major reasons That the Police has subdued the statement of PW2 taken moments after the incident.ii.	None
That PW4 corroborates the version of PW2.iii.	None
That the injury on the accused has not be accounted for.iv.	None
That the accused was also noted to be injured by all the prosecution witness, without specific statements as to the nature and all the prosecution witnesses state thatthe injury on the accused were imputed by the bystanders without much clarity.v.	None
That the mode of arrest by the police to have unauthorizedly discharged the accused from the hospital and illegally confining him for a day in police custody.vi.	None
Active botchup of investigation by the police authorities.vii.	None
Unexplained delay in registering the FIR in the police station.viii.	None
He is alleged to be the person, who had been injured in the incident.	None
From the account of eye witness, we may observe that there are at least three different versions which substantially weakens the prosecutions case.24.	Reasoning
On the point of suppression of genesis of the crime, PW20 (head constable) categorically states that he was present before the Ambulance had reached the place.	Reasoning
Even though he was extensively crossexamined, he has not budged from his position that there was no recording of any statement before the Ambulance recorded.	Reasoning
On the contrary PW2 categorically remarks that a statement was recorded by PW20 before the ambulance arrived.	None
Although the High Court has discredited the evidence of PW2 as the part which provides the aforesaid details was on recalling after few days, therefore, in light of possibility of being won over, the credibility of the statement made by PW2 needs to be viewed with this background fact.	None
However, we fail to understand internal logic of such assumption, when the prosecution has not declared the witness as hostile and more so, when his narrative is corroborated by other witnesses.	Reasoning
Therefore, PW2s evidence needs to be taken into fold.25.	None
It is matter of record that the alleged accusedappellant, was arrested in a hurried manner after the day of the incident from the hospital.	Reasoning
It is also stated that the police authorities in an unusual manner got the appellant discharged from the hospital and kept him illegally confined for a day.	Reasoning
Moreover, PW2 has categorically stated the following on the action of the police The police enquired me about the incident and I narrated the same.	None
The police and the Subinspector of Police on suspicion taken myself, PW1 (Rajendran) and PW3 (Subramanian) to Keeranur Police Station.	Reasoning
I was detained in Keeranur police station during the night and on the next day morning, I was sent to Keeranur Government Hospital for treatment.	Reasoning
Before I was examined in chief, they warned me that if I have not deposed as instructed them, they will foist a case against me and only for that reason, I have stated like that.	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied)	None
The action of investigating authority in pursuing the case in the manner which they have done must be rebuked.	Reasoning
The High Court on this aspect, correctly notices that the police authorities have botched up the arrest for reasons best known to them.	Reasoning
Although we are aware of the ratio laid down in Parbhu v. Emperor, AIR 1944 PC 73 , wherein the court had ruled that irregularity and illegality of arrest would not affect the culpability of the offence if the same is proved by cogent evidence, yet in this case at hand, such irregularity should be shown deference as the investigating authorities are responsible for suppression of facts.26.	Reasoning
The criminal justice must be above reproach.	Reasoning
It is irrelevant whether the falsity lie in the statement of witnesses or the guilt of the accused.	Reasoning
The investigative authority has a responsibility to investigate in a fair manner and elicit truth.	Reasoning
At the cost of repetition, I must remind the concerned authorities to take up the investigation in a neutral manner, without having regards to the ultimate result.	Reasoning
In this case at hand, we cannot close our eyes to what has happened regardless of guilt or the asserted persuasiveness of the evidence, the aspect wherein the police has actively connived to suppress the facts, cannot be ignored or overlooked.27.	Reasoning
Another point put forth by the learned counsel on behalf of the accusedappellant is that the prosecution has not explained the injuries suffered by the accused and hence prosecution case should not be believed.	Arguments of Petitioner
At the outset, it would be relevant to note the settled principles of law on this aspect.	Reasoning
Generally failure of the prosecution to offer any explanation in that regard shows that evidence of the prosecution witnesses relating to the incident is not true or at any rate not wholly true See Mohar Rai and Bharath Rai v. The State of Bihar, 1968 CriLJ 1479 .	Reasoning
In Lakshmi Singh and Ors.	None
v. State of Bihar, 1976 CriLJ 1736 this Court observed Where the prosecution fails to explain the injuries on the accused, two results follow (1) that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is untrue and (2) that the injuries probabilise the plea taken by the appellants.	None
It was further observed that In a murder case, the nonexplanation of the injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of the occurrence or in the course of altercation is a very important circumstance from which the Court can draw the following inferences (1) that the prosecution has suppressed the genesis and the origin of the occurrence and has thus not presented the true version (2) that the witnesses who have denied the presence of the injuries on the person of the accused are lying on a most material point and, therefore, their evidence is unreliable (3) that in case there is a defence version which explains the injuries on the person of the accused assumes much greater importance where the evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution one.	None
In the case on hand, admittedly, the accusedappellant was also injured in the same occurrence and he too was admitted in the hospital.	Reasoning
But, prosecution did not produce his medical record, nor the Doctor was examined on the nature of injuries sustained by the accused.	Reasoning
The trial Court, instead of seeking proper explanation from the prosecution for the injuries sustained by the accused, appears to have simply believed what prosecution witnesses deposed in one sentence that the accused had sustained simple injuries only.30.	Reasoning
From the evidence of I.O.PW24 it is apparent that in the scuffle PW2 (Arumugham) received simple injuries and he had taken the statement of Dr. Lavanya (PW17) who treated PW2.	Reasoning
He had also examined Dr. Illayaraj (PW18) who conducted postmortem on the body of the deceased.	Reasoning
But, in the case of accusedappellant, PW24I.O. admits that he was aware of the fact that the accusedappellant was admitted as inpatient and the accusedappellant had sustained injuries.	Reasoning
He further states that neither did he arrest the accused nor he examined the Doctor in regard to the injuries of accused.	Reasoning
In the circumstances in which the deceased, accused and also PW2 (Arumugham) got injuries, it is obligatory on the part of I.O. to examine the Doctor and seek information about the injuries sustained by the accused and the same should have been made part of the record.	Reasoning
A duty is cast on the prosecution to furnish proper explanation to the Court how the person who has been accused of assaulting the deceased, received injuries on his person in the same occurrence.	Reasoning
We may note that the injuries alleged to have been caused are not properly explained.	Reasoning
An alternative story is set up wherein the injuries are attributed to mob justice, such allegations without substantive evidence cannot be accepted.31.	Reasoning
Coming to the other aspect of the case, motive of the accused to commit the crime is ascribed to the previous quarrel occasioned between the accused and the deceased during a drama at a village festival.	Reasoning
Generally, in case prosecution desires to place motive of the accused as a circumstance, like any other incriminating circumstance, it should also be fully established.	Reasoning
We are alive to the fact that if the genesis of the motive of the occurrence is not proved, the ocular testimony of the witnesses as to the occurrence could not be discarded only on the ground of absence of motive, if otherwise the evidence is worthy of reliance.	Reasoning
But in the case on hand, as we have already discussed in the above paragraphs, the evidence of direct witnesses is not satisfactory and on the other hand, it is demonstrated that the deceased hit the accused on his head with the wooden log besides the testimony from the eye witnesses that there was scuffle.	Reasoning
In such a factual situation, certainly motive may act as a doubleedged sword.32.	None
In the light of the settled law thus by this Court and also from what is clear from the evidence, there is absence of extreme cruelty, even if it assumed that accused hit the deceased with the log.	Reasoning
Had there been a strong motive to do away with the life of deceased, generally there would have been more fatal injuries caused on the deceased not by a log but by utilizing more dangerous weapons.	Reasoning
These circumstances would tell us that there is no reason to believe that motive was entertained by the accused in the back drop of quarrel that took place during drama at the village festival, prior to the date of occurrence.	Reasoning
In as much as the prosecution laid the foundation for the commission of crime by the accused in the said quarrel as an element of motive, in the absence of positive proof of such motive, prosecution has to face the peril of failure in establishing that foundation.33.	Reasoning
Now coming to other charge under Section 324 of IPC, for causing injuries to Arumugham Ayyar PW2.	None
In light of the deficiencies noted above, it can be easily said that even the charge under Section 324 of IPC is not established.	None
The aforesaid conclusion is clearly buttressed by the fact that the injured witness himself has attributed the injury on him to the deceased, instead of the accused.	Reasoning
In such a situation conviction of the accused on the charge of Section 324 cannot be sustained under law.34.	Reasoning
Taking stock of the circumstances and depositions of prosecution witnesses in this case, it would be difficult to hold that prosecution has laid the case on real circumstances and proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.	Reasoning
We are surprised at the way in which Courts below have perceived the facts and circumstances of this case.	Reasoning
We are not in agreement with the views drawn by the trial Court as well as the High Court while dealing with the matter.35.	Reasoning
Normally this Court does not interfere with the concurrent findings recorded by the Courts below, but in this case we find certain exceptional circumstances as narrated above, considering these aspects we feel that this is a fit case for our interference.	Reasoning
In our opinion, instead of dealing with the intrinsic merits of the evidence of witnesses, both the Courts below have acted perversely.	Reasoning
Once we arrive at the conclusion that we cannot lend credence to the genuineness of the F.I.R. and the prosecution case, there is no need of further enquiry as the assertion made by the prosecution are not proved beyond reasonable doubt.	Reasoning
In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, definitely the benefit of doubt goes to the accusedappellant.	Reasoning
Viewed in that angle, the judgments of the Courts below awarding conviction and sentence to the accusedappellant requires to be set aside.36.	Reasoning
In the result, the appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence awarded by the Courts below is set aside.	Decision
The accusedappellant stands acquitted from all the charges levelled against him.	Decision
The appellant is stated to be in jail.	Decision
He may be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case.	Decision
