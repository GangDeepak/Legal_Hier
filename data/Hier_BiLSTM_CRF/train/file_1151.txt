State of Maharashtra thr. CBI, it may be pertinent to mention only the relevant facts and charges against the Appellant (A20).	None

In addition thereto there had been loss of property worth several crores.	Facts
The Bombay police investigated the matter at initial stage but subsequently it was entrusted to the Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as CBI) and on conclusion of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed against a large number of accused persons.	Facts
Out of the accused persons against whom chargesheet was filed, 40 accused could not be put to trial as they have been absconding.	Facts
Thus, the Designated Court under TADA framed charges against 138 accused persons.	Facts
During the trial, 11 accused died and 2 accused turned hostile.	Facts
Further the Designated Court discharged 2 accused during trial and the remaining persons including Appellant (A20) stood convicted.	Facts

Hence, this appeal.	Facts
Shri Sunil Kumar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant (A20), has submitted that conviction of the Appellant (A20) u s 5 TADA, was not warranted in view of the fact that the recovery had not been proved in accordance with law.	Arguments of Petitioner
The disclosure statement alleged to have been made under the provision of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter called Evidence Act) has not been strictly followed.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said alleged disclosure statement did not bear the signature of the Appellant (A20).	Arguments of Petitioner
There were two panch witnesses, only one has been examined.	Arguments of Petitioner
The panch witness examined in the case had been a stock witness in the police as he had appeared as a panch witness in other cases.	Arguments of Petitioner
He was the resident of an area in close vicinity of the office of the Crime Branch of the police department.	Arguments of Petitioner
The watchman of the Ghanshyam building from which the recovery had been made, has not been examined.	Arguments of Petitioner
None of the neighbours of that building have been examined as witnesses.	Arguments of Petitioner
There are material contradictions omissions in the deposition of the witnesses.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even the case number has wrongly been mentioned.	Arguments of Petitioner
The L.A.C. No. 22/93 had been manipulated and it was shown as L.A.C. No. 23/93.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even the recovery of the AK56 rifle does not give rise to the presumption of possession.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further submitted that the confession of the Appellant (A20) had been obtained by coercion by severely beating him.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the appeal deserves to be allowed.	Arguments of Petitioner
5.	None
On the contrary, Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondent, has vehemently opposed the appeal contending that the confession of the Appellant (A20) has not been relied upon by the Designated Court, therefore, it remains inconsequential.	Arguments of Respondent
Only one of the panch witnesses had been examined in order to avoid multiplicity.	Arguments of Respondent
Mere nonexamination of the other panch witnesses would not make the case of the prosecution doubtful.	Arguments of Respondent
The recovery had been made strictly in accordance with law and in case the recovery had been made at the instance of the disclosure statement and from the place on which the Appellant (A20) had control over, the presumption has rightly been drawn, particularly in view of the fact that the Appellant (A20) did not lead any evidence in defence.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.	Reasoning
Evidence against the Appellant (A20) Confessional statement of the Appellant (A20) Confessional statement of Murad Ibrahim Khan (A130) Deposition of Mohamed Ayub Mohamed Umar (PW72) Deposition of Sahadev (PW181) Deposition of Nagesh Shivdas Lohar (PW356) Deposition of Shivaji Shankar Sawant (PW524) Recovery of AK56 rifle and two magazines Confessional statement of the Appellant (A20)	None
The confessional statement made by the Appellant has not been relied upon by learned Special Judge.	Reasoning
Therefore, we are not making any reference to it and it has to be ignored.	Reasoning
More so, we do not find any force in the submission made by Shri Sunil Kumar that there had been two FIRs in respect of the same incident as a large number of remand applications had been filed and it is evident from the application that at initial stage it was shown as L.A.C. 23/93, but a correction had been made though without initials by the person who made the correction, but in his subsequent application it had been shown as L.A.C. 22/93.	Reasoning
More so, the FIR number connecting this case is the same.	Reasoning
Only one FIR had been exhibited in the court as Exhibit 1284A dated 18.4.1993 and it contains case No. L.A.C. 23/93.	Reasoning
Therefore, we do not think that the submission requires further consideration.	Reasoning

The recovery of the AK56 rifle and two magazines had been made on 17th/18th April, 1993 and in respect of the same panchanama Exh. 383	Reasoning
makes it clear that Farid Alam Rais Alam Qureshi and Mohamad Ayub Mohamad Umar had been the panch witnesses and in their presence the Appellant (A20) voluntarily made a disclosure statement that the AK56 rifle was kept in his workshop.	Reasoning
This panchnama was concluded at 23.10 hours on 17.4.1993.	Reasoning
The panchnama has been signed by both the witnesses as well as by the Inspector of Police, Shri S.S. Sawant.	Reasoning
However, it does not bear the signature of the Appellant (A20).	Reasoning
It further shows that in continuation of the same, the search was conducted and it reveals that after making the disclosure statement, the police had taken the accused alongwith the panch witnesses to a closed workshop named as Bona Parte industry belonging to him.	Reasoning
The said workshop was having its shutter down and locked and in absence of the key the police forced open the lock and opened the same.	Reasoning
The panchas alongwith the accused (A20) and the police party entered the workshop and found that there was no electricity however, they found that the loft measured approximately 16 x 40 had a loft with a staircase.	Reasoning

The police examined the said material and prepared the recovery memo.	Reasoning
The recovery memo contained one AK56 assault rifle of folding type butt, in rusted condition but had been greased and two magazines of AK56 assault rifle with no identification marks and numbers and it was in rusted condition and greased.	Reasoning
The Designated Court after appreciating the evidence on record came to the conclusion as under A20 having not explained the reason of his knowledge of such a contraband articles being kept in a said factory of which he was partner the same will lead only to the inference of himself having kept the same.	None
The same is obvious as A20 could have knowledge about the same in three contingencies i.e. a) he had kept the contrabands himself b) having seen somebody keeping the same there c) somebody had told him that the same being kept at the said place or having seen himself of such articles being kept at that place.	None
In view of failure of A20 to give any explanation regarding his knowledge being due to the reasons as stated in the aforesaid clauses b) and c)	None
the same will lead to the conclusion as stated aforesaid.	None
With regard to matter stated in clause c) aforesaid it can be additionally added that since the accused was also partner of the said shop allowing the remaining of such articles at the said place would also attract the liability for the same The same is the case regarding the submission advanced on the basis of A20 at the time of recovery not having the key of the relevant gala.	None
In light of the aforesaid discussion it is difficult to accept the submission canvassed that the evidence only establish the knowledge of A20 of the contraband material lying at the said place and the same does not amount to himself being in conscious possession of the same.	Reasoning
Needless to add that the inferences flowing from the statement made by A20 consciously are not of a nature of denoting himself not being in conscious possession of contraband articles within the notified area We have appreciated the evidence on record and the case depends upon the veracity of evidence regarding recovery.	Reasoning
There is sufficient material to show that the recovery had been made at the behest of the Appellant (A20) from the factory owned by a partnership to which he was the partner alongwith one Surjit Singh.	Reasoning
In such a factsituation, he ought to have explained the reason source of his knowledge of such contraband articles being kept in his factory.	Reasoning
In the instant case, as he has not mentioned that he had seen someone keeping the articles there, or somebody had told him about that, or he had seen the things lying there, the only reasonable inference is drawn that he himself had kept the same at that place.	Reasoning
Being a partner of the firm if he was having the knowledge that some contraband were lying in his premises, he ought to have informed the police if he had no guilty mind.	Reasoning
So far as the explanation that at the time of recovery he did not have the key, would not be enough to tilt the balance in his favour.	Reasoning
The fact that he did not have the key becomes totally redundant, as no conclusion can be drawn that the Appellant (A20) was not in possession of the said premises, and in such a factsituation, it cannot be held that the Appellant (A20) was not in conscious possession of the contraband material.	Reasoning
We do not find any force in the submissions made by Shri Sunil Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant (A20), that the panch witness was the resident of Sitaram building, which was opposite to the office of the Commissioner of Police, or in a very close proximity of the same, and was working on the footpath nearby the said building, and he had acted earlier as a panch witness in test identification parade.	Reasoning
The police when searching for a panch witness, need not go to far off place of the police station as the panchnama is required to be recorded in a close proximity of time, when the accused apprehending his disclosure statement.	Reasoning
Therefore, on such material suspicion about the credential of the police or panch witnesses cannot be doubted, unless there is some material to prove the contrary.	Reasoning
Had it been picked up from a far off place, criticism could have been otherwise as to why the panch witness could not be called from neighbourhood.	Reasoning
The panch witness Mohamed Ayub Mohamed Umar (PW72) could not be held to be a tutored witness or acting at the behest of the prosecution only on the ground that he had also been the witness in another case.	Reasoning
It does not give a reason to draw inference that he was a stock panch witness unless it is shown that he had acted in such capacity in a very large number of cases.	Reasoning
More so, it cannot be held that Mohamed Ayub Mohamed Umar (PW72) was not an independent witness, or acting under the pressure of the police as he was carrying the business illegally without any license.	Reasoning
More so, the Appellant (A20) had made the disclosure statement in his presence, he could explain the same.	Reasoning
Therefore, it could not be held that he was deposing falsely.	Reasoning
We do not see any reason as to why his evidence should not be relied upon.	Reasoning
Minor omissions contradictions regarding labeling and sealing are not really the contradictions which go to the root of the matter.	Reasoning
Nonexamination of the watchman of Ghanshyam Industrial Estate, or omission of factor regarding electricity being not mentioned in the panchnama, or noncollection of broken lock, are the omissions of trivial nature, and do not warrant any undue importance for doubting the evidence of recovery.	Reasoning
Law does not require the witness to corroborate the evidence of an independent witness.	Reasoning
Thus, the evidence of Mohamed Ayub Mohamed Umar (PW72) duly corroborated by the contemporaneous panchnama is trustworthy.	Reasoning
As the Appellant (A20) made a statement leading to the discovery of AK56 assault rifle and two magazines having kept in his workshop and the same had been found concealed on the loft, he cannot escape from the liability of possessing and concealing of the same, thus liable to be punished u s 5 TADA.	Decision
We see no reason to interfere with the conclusion drawn by the learned Designated Court.	Decision
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.	Decision
This appeal has been preferred against the judgments and orders dated 11.10.2006 and 31.5.2007, passed by Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA for Bombay Blast, Greater Bombay, in the Bombay Blast Case No. 1/93, by which the Appellant had been found guilty u s 5 TADA and on that count, he was sentenced to suffer RI for 5 years, and ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000/, and in default of payment of fine, to suffer further RI for 6 months.	Issue
He (A21) was further convicted Under Sections 3 and 7 read with Section 25(1A)(1B)(a) of the Arms Act, but no separate sentence was awarded for the same.	Issue
Facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that In addition to the first charge of general conspiracy, he was charged for attending conspiratorial meetings at Dubai where criminal conspiracy was discussed for distributing arms and ammunition to coconspirators and for providing funds to them.	Facts
Thus, he (A21) was charged Under Sections 3(3) and (4) TADA.	Facts
Further, he (A21) was charged with unauthorisedly being in possession of one U.S. Carbine 0.300 with three magazines and 28 cartridges in the notified area under TADA, between January 1993 and 5th April, 1993, and thus, charged Under Sections 5 and 6 TADA, and further under the provisions of Sections 3 and 7 read with Sections 25(A), 25(1B)(a) of the Arms Act.	Facts
After the trial, the Appellant (A21) stood acquitted of all the charges except charges u s 5 TADA and under the Arms Act.	Facts
Hence, this appeal.	Facts

His (A21) confessional statement had been recorded, however, the same had been discarded by the Designated Court, thus it cannot be considered.	Reasoning
The evidence against the Appellant (A21) remains the recovery of the aforesaid arms and ammunition.	Reasoning
In fact, an FIR had been registered on 5.4.1993 at 6.10 p.m. that the Appellant (A21) was found in possession of a Carbine of 30 Caliber of U.S. make, three magazines and 28 cartridges without holding a fire arms license.	Reasoning
It was further revealed that on that day, the police got information that the Appellant (A21) who was a resident of Pydhonie, Mumbai was scheduled to come near a mosque opposite Pydhonie Police Station to acquire arms and ammunition of foreign make.	Reasoning
On that information the trap was arranged near the Pydhonie Police Station.	Reasoning
At about 1.30 p.m. the trap party received the predecided signal, on which the Appellant (A21) was searched, however he was not carrying any arms and ammunition with him.	Reasoning
He was brought to the DCB, CID office and during interrogation he expressed his willingness to make a voluntary statement.	Reasoning
Therefore, two panchas were called from the nearby area and in their presence, the Appellant (A21) disclosed that he had acquired two Carbines of foreign make and some arms and ammunition from one Mujahidan and one of the said Carbine had been concealed at Naryalwadi, Mazgaon.	Reasoning
The Appellant (A21) led the police party and Panchas to Naryalwadi Muslim Cemetery (Kabaristan), Mazgaon and from the said graveyard he took out one gunny bag duly tied with a rope.	Reasoning
It had been concealed in thickly grown trees and shrubs.	Reasoning
On being examined, one single barrel Carbine, 28 cartridges and 3 magazines were found.	Reasoning
Panchnamas have made for his disclosure statement as well as for recovery of the said articles.	Reasoning

He gave a full description of how the Appellant (A21) made the disclosure statement and how the recoveries were made.	Reasoning
It corroborates the version given in the FIR.	Reasoning
However, in his crossexamination, he (PW57) stated that he (PW57) had prepared the notes for deposing in the court.	Reasoning
He had given full details of the incident of 5.4.1993.	Reasoning
In crossexamination he had admitted that he had also acted as a panch witness in 3 more cases.	Reasoning
Deposition of Dayandeo Sonaji Geete (PW320) His deposition revealed that he had accompanied the Appellant (A21) at the time of recovery alongwith others.	None
He admitted in his crossexamination that he himself had not made any entry in the Station Diary regarding the information received by Senior P.I. Shri Kumbhar about the Appellant (A21).	Reasoning
He has further deposed that he could not remember the manner in which the panch witness arrived in the office.	Reasoning
The said panch was brought by the police havaldar.	Reasoning
The Appellant (A21) had been detained in the office of DCB, CID under suspicion due to the receipt of information that he was to be at Pydhonie for acquiring arms.	Reasoning
He also deposed that the office of the Bombay Municipal Corporation was inside the Naryalwadi Kabristan from where the recovery had been made at the instance of the Appellant (A21).	Reasoning
He further proved the recovery and denied the suggestions that the Appellant (A21) did not make any disclosure statement nor any recovery had been made at his behest.	Reasoning
He has also identified Appellant (A21) in the court.	Reasoning
The deposition of Dayandeo Sonaji Geete (PW320) has been fully corroborated by another police official Vijay Meru (PW561) in all respects.	Reasoning
However, he has admitted that he had not made any entry in the Station Diary regarding the information received by Senior P.I. Shri Kumbhar, nor he was aware how the panch witness arrived and who was the police havaldar who brought the panch witnesses.	Reasoning
However, he (PW561) deposed that he had detained the Appellant (A21) on information that he was to be at Pydhonie for acquiring arms.	Reasoning
Appellant (A21) came there at about 1.30 p.m. and on getting the signal, the police party pounced upon him and apprehended him.	Reasoning
Appellant (A21) was searched but he was not carrying any weapon, however, one Ceiko watch, his driving licence, labour card bearing his photograph of Arab Emirates and some Dirhams and a silver ring were found with him.	Reasoning

The currency in Dirhams was of the value of Rs. 13 to 14 thousand Indian rupees.	Reasoning
He was interrogated by A.C.P. Shri Babar (PW683) and Senior P.I. Shri Kumbhar.	Reasoning
It was during his interrogation that Appellant (A21) expressed his desire to make the voluntary statement regarding fire arms.	Reasoning
Thus, two panches were called.	Reasoning
The suspect was introduced to the panches.	Reasoning
The memorandum panchnama was prepared in respect of his disclosure statement.	Reasoning
It was signed by panch witnesses and, thus, he supported the recovery of the articles as narrated by the other witnesses.	Reasoning

PW.	Reasoning
561 registered the said offence as LAC No. 18 of 1993 against the Appellant (A21) for the offences punishable Under Sections 3 and 7 read with Section 25 of the Arms Act.	Reasoning
Though he was competent to answer as to whether the panch witnesses had been stock witnesses or whether there was any discrepancy in drawing the memorandum panchnama but defence did not ask any question during his crossexamination.	Reasoning
He (PW561) identified the Appellant (A21) on 24.4.1998 in the court and he has denied the suggestion made by the defence that the Appellant (A21) had not made any disclosure statement, nor the recovery of arms had been made on his disclosure statement.	Reasoning
Deposition of Shivajirao Kondiram Babar, ACP (PW683) In his deposition, he revealed that he had received the information about Appellant (A21) that he would get the weapons near a mosque opposite police station Pydhonie.	Reasoning
He had received the information from a secret source on telephone, he recorded the same and passed on the same to the senior officers.	Reasoning
He deposed that on 5.4.1993 while he was in his office at Crawford Market, he had received the information from his source on telephone to the effect that Appellant (A21) involved in Bombay blast case was in possession of fire arms and would be available at Pydhonie.	Reasoning
Immediately thereafter, he formed a team of police officers and staff and went to the Pydhonie and arrested the Appellant (A21), brought him to the office of DCB, CID at Crawford Market and he (A21) was interrogated.	Reasoning

So, the report was positive.	None
The Appellant (A21) made a complaint before the Designated Court, and the court directed his medical examination.	Reasoning
He was examined and again sent on police remand.	Reasoning
After appreciating the entire evidence, the learned Designated Court came to the conclusion as under Since criminal conspiracies are hatched in secrecy and it is extremely difficult to collect the direct evidence about the same the established principles of law indicate that the standard of a proof requiring such type of cases is loosened, unnecessary hard standards regarding the identity of a particular person cant be expected Thus, considering in proper perspective all the said evidence, no other conclusion will emerge of A21 having committed all the offences for which he is charged with on the account of commission of overt acts, but the same will lead any prudent man to the legitimate conclusion of A21 having committed the aforesaid acts for the purposes of furthering the object of conspiracy.	Reasoning
In view of above, the Designated Court found him guilty and imposed the punishment as referred to hereinabove.	Decision
We find no reason to interfere with the directions of the Designated Court.	Decision
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.	Decision

But acquitted for the charge of conspiracy.	Facts
Hence, this appeal.	Facts
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant, has submitted that in spite of the ample evidence against the said Respondents (A20 and A21) in view of their involvement in conspiracy, the court below committed the grave error in discarding the same.	Arguments of Petitioner
The evidence requires total reappreciation and the confessional statements of the Respondents (A20 and A21) and other coaccused have to be taken into consideration.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the appeal deserves to be allowed.	Arguments of Petitioner
44.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Shri Mushtaq Ahmad, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents (A20 and A21), has submitted that their confessional statements have rightly been discarded as the same had been recorded in utter disregard to the statutory provisions.	Arguments of Respondent
The appeal lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed.	Decision
We have considered rival submissions made by the counsel for the parties and perused the records.	Reasoning
The confessional statements of Ahmad Shah Khan Salim Durani (A20), Shaikh Aziz Ahmed (A21), Moiddin Abdul Kadar Cheruvattam (A48) and Ismail Abbas Patel (A80) had been relied upon by the prosecution.	Reasoning
The same stood discarded completely by the learned Special Judge on the ground that all the confessional statements had been recorded by the Police officer in utter disregard to the mandatory provisions of Section 15 TADA and Rule 15 of TADA Rules, 1987.	Reasoning
The police officer failed to inform the said accused persons while recording their respective statements that they were not bound to make confessional statement and further failed to warn that, in case, they made statements, the same would be used as evidence against them.	Reasoning
More so, the required certificate was not attached to the said statements.	Reasoning
This Court has laid down parameters for interference against the order of acquittal time and again.	Reasoning
The appellate court should not ordinarily set aside a judgment of acquittal in a case where two views are possible, though the view of the appellate court may be the more probable one.	Reasoning
While dealing with a judgment of acquittal, the appellate court has to consider the entire evidence on record, so as to arrive at a finding as to whether the views of the trial court were perverse or otherwise unsustainable.	Reasoning
The appellate court is entitled to consider whether in arriving at a finding of fact, the trial court had failed to take into consideration admissible evidence and or had taken into consideration the evidence brought on record contrary to law.	Reasoning
Similarly, wrong placing of burden of proof may also be a subjectmatter of scrutiny by the appellate court.	Reasoning
In exceptional cases where there are compelling circumstances, and the judgment under appeal is found to be perverse, the appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal.	Reasoning
The appellate court should bear in mind the presumption of innocence of the accused and further that the trial courts acquittal bolsters the presumption of his innocence.	Reasoning
Interference in a routine manner where the other view is possible should be avoided, unless there are good reasons for interference.	Reasoning
The findings of fact recorded by a court can be held to be perverse if the findings have been arrived at by ignoring or excluding relevant material or by taking into consideration irrelevant inadmissible material.	Reasoning
The finding may also be said to be perverse if it is against the weight of evidence, or if the finding so outrageously defies logic as to suffer from the vice of irrationality.	Reasoning
In view of the fact that no legal evidence which could be relied upon by the prosecution is available on record, we do not find any fault with the impugned judgment and order.	Decision
The appeal lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed.	Decision
More so, the Respondents (A20 and A21) have filed appeals, as referred to hereinabove, and they have served 4 years of sentence and deposited the fine.	Decision
The appeal stands dismissed.	Decision
Criminal Appeal No. 1311 of 2007 This appeal has been preferred against the judgments and orders dated 11.10.2006 and 31.5.2007, passed by the learned Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA, in the Bombay Blast Case No. 1/93.	Issue

The panch witnesses could not be relied upon as they were not the natural witnesses i.e. resident of the said area.	Arguments of Petitioner

Reasoning
He has stated throughout that he was a landing agent and involved in smuggling.	Reasoning
However, he had no knowledge that arms were being smuggled and he participated in the same, taking it to be smuggling of silver only.	Reasoning
The confessional statements of coaccused do not speak of the knowledge of the Appellant (A30) regarding the smuggling of arms and they too, have only deposed about smuggling of silver.	Reasoning
In view of the discussion in Criminal Appeal No. 1728 of 2007, the date of the recording of the confession has no bearing so long as the accused are being tried for the same crime in the same trial.	Reasoning
After the amendment, confessional statement of coaccused Jamir Sayyed Ismail Kadri (A133), Salim Kutta (A134) and Mechanic Chacha (A136) had been recorded.	Reasoning

On 4.12.1992, he was contacted by Assistant Collector (Customs) R.K. Singh (A102) through a Customs Sepoy.	None
On reaching there at 800 p.m., R.K. Singh, Assistant Collector, Custom (A102) called him in the cabin and asked about the landing that had been made on the previous day upon replying he was told to wait with Custom Inspector Gurav (A82).	Reasoning
He (A30) went to Mohd.	Reasoning
Dossa on 5.12.1992 and explained to him, and to Mechanic Chacha (A136), the entire incident.	Reasoning
Mechanic Chacha (A136) gave him (A30), some money to be paid to the Mhasla Custom Staff, the Shrivardhan Custom Staff, the Murud Custom Staff and also to R.K. Singh (A102).	Reasoning
On the same day he (A30) handed over the money to some of them.	Reasoning
Subsequently, it was revealed that the rates that were to be paid to the police officers as well as the customs officers per landing were fixed, and were also revised from time to time, and the Appellant (A30) had been very much involved in making the payment.	Reasoning
Therefore, it is clear that he (A30) enjoyed a higher status in the hierarchy of the gang of smugglers, and that he had been assigned an important role of negotiating with customs officers and police officers, to remove any hindrance in the said smuggling.	Reasoning
It is also clear that payments were made through him (A30).	None
The Appellant (A30) confessed, that on 9.1.1993 he, alongwith coaccused Salim Kutta (A134) and Mechanic Chacha (A136) had participated in the landing of smuggled goods and when they were coming to Dighi Jetty, on the way he had also met Gurav (A82), who was driving his jeep.	Reasoning
Thereafter, their vehicles were intercepted by Patil (A116) an Inspector, near Gondghar Phata.	Reasoning
In order to negotiate a safe passage for the smuggled goods, Mechanic Chacha (A136) offered him a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs, and when they were asked about the contents of the wooden boxes, Mechanic Chacha (A136) stated that the same contained watches.	Reasoning
On the said day, they had no cash and, therefore, Mechanic Chacha (A136) took out five silver bricks from the first truck and gave them to Shri Patil, SI of Shrivardhan.	Reasoning
The Appellant (A30) drove Guravs jeep (A82) and came to Kanghar.	Reasoning

It was on that day that he learnt that the goods were being sent by Mohd.	Reasoning
Dossa.	Reasoning
On 9.1.1993 at 7.00 p.m. Shabbir, Salim (A134) and Feroz left for Dighi Jetty to unload the smuggled goods.	Reasoning
He (A133) stayed at home.	Reasoning
They returned at 5 a.m. with three wooden boxes, which were kept by them in the hall of the house, and he then slept there.	Reasoning
From their conversation, the witness learnt that there were 300 ingots of silver in total, each of them weighing 30 Kgs. and 19 ingots which could not be loaded in the truck, and the same were then hidden in the open land of one Subedar who was at the said time, living in Nairobi.	Reasoning
On 10.1.1993, the Appellant (A30) came to his house during the night and spoke to Salim (A134) and Shabbir and went away.	Reasoning
From their discussion he (A133) understood that silver and weapons had been smuggled at Dighi Jetty on the previous night.	Reasoning
He (A133), alongwith others, brought 19 silver ingots and 15/20 green coloured bags containing tin boxes in a bullock cart, and kept them in their house and then fell asleep.	Reasoning
After about two days, Afzal Gadbad, who works in the office of Mohd.	Reasoning
Dossa in Bombay, came there and took away the said silver ingots in a jeep.	Reasoning
However, the tin boxes remained there.	Reasoning
After about a month, upon being asked by Shabbir, the said tin boxes and bags were taken to the first floor of the house of Ali Mian Faki, which was in close proximity to their house.	Reasoning
Janardhan Pandurang Gambas (A81) who is a resident of that area, and a fisherman who had participated in the smuggling with Shabbir, the Appellant (A30) and Abdulla Surati told the witness that the smuggled goods also contained weapons alongwith silver ingots.	Reasoning
Confessional Statement of Salim Kutta (A134)	Reasoning
He has corroborated the confessional statement of the Appellant (A30).	Reasoning
However, he (A134) did not say anything to show that the Appellant (A30) had knowledge regarding the contents of the boxes, particularly as regards the weapons.	Reasoning
He stated that the Appellant (A30) was present during the landing at Dighi Jetty and had made arrangements for labour and a boat.	Reasoning
After the loading of the landed goods on vehicles, the Appellant (A30) had also participated in negotiations with the police upon being interception by them.	Reasoning
Confessional Statement of Faki Ali Faki Ahmed (A74)	Reasoning
He (A74) corroborated the fact that the Appellant (A30) was a landing agent and a resident of Mhasla, and that the Appellant (A30) was well acquainted with Shabbir and Jamir (A133) who were involved in smuggling activities.	Reasoning
Deposition of Dilip Pansare (PW. 97)  	Reasoning
In his deposition, he reveals that he was a childhood friend of the Appellant (A30) and had been working in a government department.	Reasoning
However, he had driven the truck containing smuggled goods.	Reasoning
He has also deposed that upon interception by Inspector Patil (A116), a discussion ensued for half an hour, amongst the Appellant (A30), Gurav (A82), Shabbir Kadri and Inspector Patil (A116).	Reasoning
He identified the truck, though the owner and the driver of the truck were neither made accused, nor witnesses in this case.	Reasoning
Deposition of Vyankatesh Hirba (PW. 588)  	Reasoning
He was the officer who had effected the seizure of the Tempo bearing number MH065533 on 12.4.93.	Reasoning
The Appellant (A30) in his confession has stated that the said tempo was used to transport contraband items which were landed at Dighi Jetty.	Reasoning
Deposition of Dinesh Nakti (PW. 95) speaks of silver ingots and wooden boxes.	Reasoning
He identified the Appellant in court.	Reasoning
A conjoint reading of the confessional statement and deposition of witnesses reveal that Appellant (A30) had been an associate of Mohd.	Reasoning
Dossa (AA) and was aware of the fact that Mohd.	Reasoning
Dossa (AA) was involved in criminal activities.	Reasoning
A30 was also associate of coaccused Mechanic Chacha, Shabbir, Salim, Feroz and Jamir Sayyed Kadri.	Reasoning
A30 has been working as a landing agent for Mohd.	Reasoning
Dossa and Ors.	Reasoning
by arranging boats and coolies.	Reasoning
A30 was called to Mhasla on 4.12.1992 wherein he disclosed about the previous day landing to R.K. Singh (A102), Custom Officer.	Reasoning
Subsequent to the said meeting, A30 received Rs. 6.25 lacs from A136 and paid Rs. 1 lac to Mhasla Custom staff, Rs. 1.5 lacs to Shrivardhan Custom staff, Rs. 1.25 lac to R.K. Singh, Custom Officer.	Reasoning
A30 made arrangements for boats and coolies for another landing scheduled for 9.2.1993 and went to Dighi Jetty on his motorcycle on 9.2.1993.	Reasoning
He met Custom Inspector Gurav (A82) and started driving jeep of Gurav.	Reasoning
When the trucks carrying contraband smuggled goods were intercepted by police team headed by PSI V.K. Patil, A30 told Mr. Patil that the money for earlier landing had been paid to Mali Havaldar who was also member of that police team.	Reasoning
It was in his presence that Mechanic Chacha (A136) offered Rs. 10 lacs to PSI Patil and as they did not have money, they gave him 5 silver bricks as a security.	Reasoning
A30 alongwith others shifted 170 bricks in the cavity of two trucks of Bombay and 80 silver bricks were transferred from one truck to another at the residence of Shabbir (AA).	Reasoning
He also went to the residence of Shabbir.	Reasoning
A30 left the message at Shrivardhan Police Station that he would come with money on the night of 10.2.1993.	Reasoning
In his presence Rs. 2 lacs were paid to Patil, PSI at Shrivardhan Naka and Rs. 5 lacs were paid to Havaldars.	Reasoning
A30 received Rs. 3 lacs from Feroz on the same night to hand it over to Custom Officer of Alibagh and he handed it over to R.K. Singh and Sayyed.	Reasoning
After appreciating the evidence on record, the learned Designated Court reached the following conclusions However considering further events which had occurred at Ghonghar Patta i.e. interception of goods by police, allowing the same to be further proceeded after negotiations with smugglers, presence of A30 who was one of the main person, or effecting landing, his role in the said episode, it is difficult to perceive that at the said juncture A30 would not have gathered the knowledge of contraband material.	Reasoning
Needless to add that in cases of conspiracy it is difficult to except to have direct evidence and the inference about certain aspects is required to be drawn from established facts circumstances.	Reasoning
Thus having regard to all the aforesaid facets it is difficult to accept that at least at the said place A30 would not have gathered the nature of contraband goods also sent along with smugglers.	Reasoning
It is true that the said further acts committed by A30 being in the nature of continuing job for which he had agreed i.e. effecting the silver landing the same may not make him liable for being party to the conspiracy to commit the terrorist act or the larger conspiracy for which the charge at head 1stly is framed.	Reasoning
Such a conclusion is obvious as hardly there exists any other material denoting that alter completion of job of landing transportation, A30 having committed any act furthering object of ally conspiracy.	Reasoning
However, still now the further act being committed by A30 being with an expressed knowledge that the contraband material was containing arms ammunitions he will be squarely liable for commission of offence u s 3(3) of TADA.	Reasoning
Similarly the quantity of the said arms ammunition and the further acts actually committed by A30 would also make him liable for commission of offence u s 6 TADA.	Reasoning
Thus considering the said aspect it will be extremely difficult to accept that policemen would not have been aware about the nature of said goods in trucks which were in the said trucks i.e. silver and arms ammunitions as established by evidence.	None
Such an inference is inevitable as such evidence pertaining to landing clearly denotes of the material being of two different categories i.e. boxes and bachkies i.e. bundles.	Reasoning
Having regard to the same it is difficult to perceive that during inspection of trucks at least parcels from each category would not have been inspected by policemen.	Reasoning
Having regard to aforesaid even assuming that police party had permitted the said trucks to proceed away without inspection then also they cannot escape the liability arising out of said illegal omission committed by them.	None
In view of the same the knowledge of the nature of contraband goods will he required to be presumed for them.	None
Now considering the liability of A136 as revealed from the earlier discussion but without once again repeating the dilation made earlier it can be said that the same having revealed that A136 had become aware about the nature of goods after he was told regarding the same and the direction of accused Mustafa Dossa by A134.	None
As dilated earlier, it is clear that though A136 had continued with the said operation i.e. the operation of smuggling for which he had agreed earlier and in the process having committed the offence u s 3(3) of TADA still he cannot be said to be guilty for the offence of conspiracy to which A134 was said to be party.	None
Needless to add that considering the acts committed by A136, his liability remained confined to having committed the offence u s 3(3) and Section 6 of TADA.	None
The case of A30 also appears to be similar to that of A136 i.e. himself being not aware since the beginning of the goods to be smuggled being arms ammunitions and having acquired the knowledge about same during the midst of operation but in spite of the said knowledge having continued the said operation giving rise to the liability for commission of offence u s 3(3) Section 6 of TADA.	None
At the cost of repetition it will be required to be added that A136 and A30 having committed the relevant acts in the month of Jan., 1993 on the dates on which even Tiger Memon had not disclosed his intent regarding the places at which the explosions were to be committed in Bombay and themselves having not committed any act other than completing the smuggling operation for which they had agreed they cannot he held guilty for any offence of conspiracy though would he liable for commission of offences as stated aforesaid.	None
The confession of A134 does not show that the Appellant (A30) was aware of the contents of the contraband goods were arms and ammunition, either prior to the landing or thereafter.	None
However, considering the event of interception of the said goods by the police and the presence and involvement of the Appellant (A30) in negotiations with the police for clearing the said smuggled goods, it is difficult to believe, that at the said time, the Appellant (A30) did not have knowledge regarding the contraband material.	None
The confession of A133 however reveals that he (A133) had overheard the Appellant (A30) discussing the contents of the contraband after the items had landed.	None
In case of conspiracy, it is difficult to find direct evidence and thus, inference is required to be drawn from established facts and circumstances.	Reasoning
Hence, it is difficult to accept, that in the said circumstances the Appellant (A30) was unaware of the nature of the smuggled goods.	None
The acts that were further committed by the Appellant (A30), were in the nature of continuing his job in effecting the landing of silver, and the same may not make him liable as a party to the conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.	Reasoning
However, certain other acts that were committed by him (A30), with the express knowledge that the contraband material did in fact contain arms and ammunition, would make him liable for commission of offence u s 3(3) TADA.	Reasoning
Furthermore, the quantity of arms and ammunition, and the further acts committed by the Appellant would also make him liable for commission of offence u s 6 TADA.	None
The examination of the Appellant (A30) u s 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure reveals that he had assisted in the landing of goods at Dighi Jetty on 9.1.1993, and that he had taken the stand of being involved in the landings of silver even prior to the said event, and that he did not know the nature of the goods that were landed in the said landing.	None
The evidence of PWs 95 and 97 corroborates the fact that landing had occurred at the said time and place.	None
Their evidence reveals that the goods were packed in boxes, or in green coloured cloth bag that had been tied at the mouth, and that thus, they were not aware of the contents.	None
They had acted at the behest of the Appellant (A30) for which they had received payment.	None
The Appellant (A30) was aware that the smuggled goods were arms and ammunition, and even after acquiring such knowledge, he had continued the landing of the said smuggled goods.	None
This makes him liable for commission of offences u s 3(3) and 6 TADA.	None
His (A30) role is akin to that of Mechanic Chacha (A136).	None
Thus, we do not find any force in the appeal and it is accordingly dismissed.	Decision
The parameters laid down by this Court in entertaining the appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.	Reasoning
The evidence on record made it crystal clear that A30 was not only a close associate of Tiger Memon (AA) and acting as a landing agent, but a man of confidence who could negotiate with the police and customs officials to fix the amount of bribe for facilitating the smuggling and transportation of the smuggled contraband.	None
He was a person who had negotiated with the police at Gondghar Phata.	None
He had been fully aware of the nature of contraband, and in spite of coming to know that the contraband contained arms, ammunition and explosives, he continued to help the smugglers.	None
It is also evident that he had close association with Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82), officer of the customs department, who had been helping the smugglers by taking a bribe through A30.	None
Therefore, in view of the above, we do not concur with the findings of fact recorded by the learned Designated Court that A30 could not be convicted for conspiracy.	None
In the facts and circumstances, the appeal filed by the Appellant (A30) is dismissed, and appeal filed by the State through CBI is allowed.	Decision
Appellant (A30) is convicted for the offence under Charge I, and awarded the life imprisonment.	Decision
The Designated Court is directed to take him into custody and send him to Jail to serve out the remaining sentence, if any.	Decision
Criminal Appeal No. 1420 of 2007 This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 31.5.2007, passed by Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA for Bombay Blast, Greater Bombay, by which the Appellant (A46) has been convicted u s 3(3) TADA.	Issue
However, Criminal Appeal No. 1031 of 2012 has been filed by the State against the said judgment as A46 stood acquitted of the charge of larger conspiracy.	Issue

Both the sentences were directed to run concurrently.	Facts
Hence, this appeal.	Facts
Shri Mushtaq Ahmad, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, has submitted that the Appellant (A46) has wrongly been enroped in the crime, he was no where involved.	Arguments of Petitioner
The confessional statements of the Appellant as well as the coaccused could not be relied upon as it has been obtained by coercion and it could not be held to be useful and truthful.	Arguments of Petitioner
More so, the learned Designated Court failed to appreciate the evidence in correct perspective.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, appeal deserves to be allowed.	Arguments of Petitioner
104.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra, Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the State, opposed the appeal contending that the Appellant had been deeply involved, not only in the landing and transportation of the smuggled goods, but being a very close associate of Tiger Memon (AA), was involved in the conspiracy also for which he has wrongly been acquitted.	Arguments of Respondent
The evidence on record fully established his involvement in the crime.	Arguments of Respondent

The evidence has also established his involvement in commission of the offence of conspiracy with the object of committing terrorist acts, as the Appellant (A18) had been made aware of the nature of the smuggled goods and had still transported the same.	None

However it has been held that the Appellant (A18) himself has not committed any act and that he himself has not participated in any conspiratorial meetings, to denote that he was actually a party to the conspiracy to commit serial bomb Blast or a party to the larger conspiracy i.e. the first charge.	None
So far as the Appellant (A18) is concerned, undoubtedly, there is sufficient evidence to show that he was involved in the transportation of contraband.	None
From the facts and circumstances of the case, and after taking into consideration the evidence on record, it cannot be inferred that despite being a close associate of Tiger Memon (AA), he remained unaware of the nature of the contraband.	None
Furthermore, when a person has been transporting goods for a long period of time it is difficult to believe that he would transport the said goods, without ascertaining the exact nature of goods being loaded into his vehicle, particularly, in view of the fact that the vehicle is likely to be checked at several places by the police, as well as by custom officials.	None
Thus, we do not see any cogent reason to hold that the Appellant (A18) is not guilty of the charges for which he has been punished by the Designated Court.	None

Thus considering material in the confession of A73 and aforesaid coaccused the same leads to the conclusion of A73 also being involved in Shekadi landing operations denoted by said material and as such having committed offence u s 3(3) of TADA for which he is charged at head 2ndly.	None
Similarly, considering said evidence in proper perspective and same and particularly own confession of A73 squarely denoting that he was fully aware that contraband goods which were shifted from trucks to other vehicles where arms, ammunition, handgrenades and RDX etc.	None
and still himself having transported the same to Bombay by driving vehicle and even in Bombay having committed further acts regarding contraband goods the same clearly indicates that his act were directed to further object of conspiracy to commit terrorist act.	None
No doubt that he has received amount of Rs. 1 thousand for work effected by him.	None
However the same will never change character of act committed by him.	None
Similarly the acts committed by him were obviously for purposes of aiding and abetting terrorist accused who were to use the same for commission of terrorist act.	None
A73 having committed said act by contravening provision of Arms and Explosive Act he was also required to be held liable for offence u s 6 of TADA for which he charged at head 3rdly.	None
However unlike other accused involved in transportation alike A73, A73 after Shekhadi landing operation had not participated in commission of any act furthering object of any conspiracy.	None
The acts were committed by him during early phase i.e. much prior to even Tiger Memon fixing target for commission of serial blast.	None
A73 had never been party to any conspiratorial meeting after effecting said landing job nor was involved in any of operation thereafter effected in pursuance of conspiracy to commit serial blast.	None
In view of same though A73 is found to be guilty for offence of conspiracy the same would be conspiracy to commit terrorist act punishable u s 3(3) of TADA or in other words he cannot be held liable for larger conspiracy for which charge at head 1stly is framed against him.	None
In view of the fact that there is no evidence to show that the Respondent (A73) ever participated in any of the conspiratorial meetings after the said landing, or was involved in any of the operation thereafter in pursuance of the conspiracy to commit the serial Blast, he could be punished only for smaller conspiracy u s 3(3) TADA and not for the larger conspiracy for which the charge No. 1 had been framed.	None
In the facts and circumstances of the case, the Respondent (A73) had been convicted and awarded sufficient punishment.	None
The parameters laid down by this Court in entertaining the appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.	Reasoning
In view of the above, we do not find any cogent reason to hold that findings recorded by the learned Designated Court are perverse, warranting any interference by this Court.	Decision
The appeal lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.	Decision
This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 2.8.2007 passed by the Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA for Bombay Blast Case No. 1 of 1993 by which the Respondent has been convicted u s 3(3) TADA on two counts and awarded rigorous imprisonment for 7 years with a fine of Rs. 25,000/ and in default of payment of fine, to suffer further RI for a period of six months on one count and 7 years rigorous imprisonment u s 3(3) TADA on the second count.	Issue
However, he had been acquitted of the first charge of conspiracy.	Facts
The appeal has basically been filed only for enhancement of punishment, or for conviction of the Respondent for main charge of conspiracy.	Facts
In addition to the first charge, the general charge of conspiracy had been framed for participating in the landing and transportation of contraband at Shekhadi for commission of terrorist activities for transporting the smuggled contraband, including weapons through his tempo bearing No. MMP4799 from Shekhadi to Panvel for committing terrorist acts and further for participating in weapons training at Shekhadi.	Facts
Out of the said charges, the charge of participation in weapons training at Shekhadi was not proved.	Facts
Hence, this appeal.	Facts
Heard rival submissions made by the counsel for both parties and perused the evidence on record.	Reasoning
The evidence against the said Respondent has been his own confession which had been retracted and it had been corroborated by the confessional statements of Abdul Gani Ismail Turk (A11), Parvez Nazir Ahmed Shaikh (A12), Sayyed Abdul Rehman Shaikh (A28), Liyakat Ali Habib Khan and Sharif Abdul Gafoor Parkar (A17).	Arguments of Petitioner
His involvement in the crime has also been corroborated by the deposition of Uttam M. Kale (PW. 190) in whose presence the confessional statement of coaccused had been recorded.	None
Deposition of Vijay Govind More (PW. 137), a labourer at Wangni Tower and Sanjay Pandey (PW. 492) have also supported the case of the prosecution.	None
The Designated Court appreciated the evidence and held as under Thus, considering material in the confession of A18 and aforesaid coaccused the same leads to the conclusion of A18 also being involved in Shekhadi landing operation as denoted by said material and as such having committed offence u s 3(3) of TADA for which he is charged at head 2ndly clauses a and b to the extent of transportation of contraband material of the said landing effected by him.	None
Similarly, considering the manner in which he had acted in the said episode for furthering the object of conspiracy to commit terrorist act as denoted by said material the same also establishes his involvement in commission of offence of conspiracy to commit terrorist act punishable u s 3(3) of TADA.	None
Now taking up work of determining sentence for A18 28 in light of submission canvassed at Bar, reasoning given during earlier part of judgment and particularly declaration made in consequent to same on 11th of October, 2006 regarding A18 and 17th Oct., 2006 regarding A28 reveals that though both of them were charged for commission of offence of conspiracy and for commission of offence u s 3(3) of TADA i.e. A18 on 3 subcounts A28 on 2 subcounts each of them was found guilty for commission of offence only on two subcounts to the extent as found during the assessment of evidence for commission of offences punishable u s 3(3) of TADA.	None
Without unnecessarily reiterating every aspect connected with decision arrived accordingly, in short it can be said that both of them are found guilty accordingly mainly due to acts committed by each of them in connection with Shekhadi Landings and or transportation of contraband goods smuggled by effecting the said landings.	None
The said landing was effected by Tiger Memon on two occasions in month of February, 1993 in which Tiger Memon and his associates at the behest of absconding accused Dawood Ibrahim has smuggled arms, ammunition and explosives and transported same from Shekhadi Coast via Wangni Tower to Bombay.	None
The evidence surfaced and or reasoning given thereon earlier also reveal that both A18 28 since earlier had close association with Tiger Memon and were carrying out the work of Drivers for transportation of smuggled goods and in the questioned landing they had transported the contraband goods in a manner as discussed in the earlier part of the judgment.	None
The reasons given earlier in terms reveal the evidence having established that both of them were men of confidence of Tiger Memon.	None
The same also reveals that they were aware and or had become aware about the nature of the goods which they were transporting and or had transported.	None
Having regard to the same and having regard to the fact that both of them, even after acquiring the knowledge had not taken any steps revealing that they were against transportation of such a contraband goods, which was arms and ammunition and RDX material and since the act committed by them being in the nature of furthering the object of conspiracy to commit terrorists act, they were held guilty for the offence of a conspiracy to the said extent.	None
Since, evidence has not revealed that both these accused had committed any further acts after the said transportation and or thereafter A18 having stopped the work for Anwar at the behest of whom he was involved in the said work and so also both of them being not connected with any of the operation effected for achieving the object of entire conspiracy i.e. both of them being not involved in acquiring the training, attending conspiratorial meetings, in which the targets were selected etc.	None
they could not be held guilty for commission of offence of conspiracy to commit the serial bomb blast etc.	None

The issue whether confessional statements made by Faki Ali Faki Ahmed Subedar (A74) and Janardhan Pandurang Gambas (A81) were voluntary, had been considered by the Designated Court in its judgment and after considering all the objections it came to the conclusion that Faki Ali Faki Ahmed Subedar (A74) and Janardhan Pandurang Gambas (A81) had made confessional statement voluntarily as T.S. Bhal (PW. 191), S.P., Raigad has deposed that the Appellant (A81) was produced by Ashok Krishanji Chandgude (PW. 670) before him on 20.5.1993 and after asking certain questions to him, T.S.

The theory was rejected.	None
After appreciating the evidence on record the learned Designated Court came to the conclusion that the involvement of the Appellant (A81) in landing at Dighi Jetty is established, but there is hardly any evidence to reveal that the Appellant (A81) had knowledge of contraband goods being arms and ammunitions, and thus the Appellant (A81) cannot be held liable for offence u s 3(3) TADA on said count i.e. first limb of second charge, but guilty for offence punishable u s 111 read with Section 135(b) of Customs Act, 1962 for the same.

None
The learned Designated Court after appreciating the evidence came to the conclusion that landing of contraband material took place at Dighi Jetty on 9.1.1993 during night time and goods were transported from said Jetty in two trucks.	None
The said contraband contained arms and ammunition, AK56 rifles and bullets etc.	None

However, it was further held that the Appellant (A110) was member of police party headed by his superior Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116) and though the Appellant (A110) could not be said to be responsible for taking decision of permitting further transportation of said goods, however taking into account the fact that he had not reported about Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116) to higher officials, reveals that he had also connived with Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116) in performing said acts.	None
We find no evidence on record requiring interference with the judgment of the learned Designated Court.	Decision
The appeal with reference to Appellant (A110) lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.	Decision

This has been explained fully in the court by Pratap Dighavkar (PW586).	None
He deposed that as some of the samples had to be taken out of the recovered material and sent for FSL report, it was reopened on 18.4.1993 and samples had been sent for FSL.	None
Thus, the contraband materials recovered on the disclosure statement of these Appellants were further wrapped in newspapers.	None
So, it was quite possible that newspapers upto 18.4.1993 could have been used.	None
None of the Appellants had put any further question on possibility of tampering of the evidence to the said witness (PW586), though he proved the letter with which the contraband materials were sent for FSL and the FSL report itself, but none of the Appellants put any question in his crossexamination on the possibility of tampering of the material etc.	None
He was the only person who could have explained all the questions raised by the Appellants before us.	None
More so, Ms. Farhana Shah, learned Counsel for the Appellants could not satisfy the court as under what circumstances none of the Appellants could raise this issue before the learned Designated Court.	None
In view of the above, the contention raised does not have any force.	Decision
The appeal is dismissed accordingly.	Decision

401 and 595 of 2011 These appeals have been preferred by the State against Abdullah Ibrahim Surti (A66), Faki Ali Faki Ahmed Subedar (A74) and Janardhan Pandurang Gambas (A81), who were acquitted of the charge of larger conspiracy.	Issue
The evidence against all the three Respondents had elaborately been dealt with in the connected appeal filed by them.	Issue
The learned Designated Court has dealt with the issue after considering the entire evidence on record and appreciating the depositions as well as the confessional statements made by the parties.	Issue
We are fully aware of our limitation to interfere with an order against acquittal.	None
In exceptional cases where there are compelling circumstances and the judgment under appeal is found to be perverse, the appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal.	Reasoning
The appellate court should bear in mind the presumption of innocence of the accused and further that the trial Courts acquittal bolsters the presumption of his innocence.	Reasoning
Interference in a routine manner where the other view is possible should be avoided, unless there are good reasons for interference.	Reasoning
(Vide State of Rajasthan Vs.	None
Darshan Singh Darshan Lal, In view of the above, we do not see any cogent reason to interfere with the order of the Designated Court so far as the acquittal of the Respondents on a particular charge is concerned.	None
The appeals lack merit and are liable to be dismissed.	Decision
Criminal Appeal No. 171 172 of 2008 These appeals have been preferred against the judgments and orders dated 26.9.2006 and 21.5.2007, passed by the Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA for the Bombay Blast, Greater Bombay, in the Bombay Blast Case	Issue
No. 1/1993, by which the Appellants have been convicted u s 3(3) TADA.	Issue

They have already served a sentence of 4 years and 3 months.	Issue
Facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals are that In addition to the first charge of conspiracy, the Appellants have been charged for intentionally aiding and abetting terrorists, by allowing them to smuggle and transport arms and ammunition into India for the purpose of committing terrorist acts, by their illegal omission to thoroughly check motor lorries carrying arms, ammunition and other contraband, though the same had been intercepted by their team on the night of 9.1.1993, at Gondghar Phata, and for their failure to seize the aforesaid motor truck and its contents, in lieu of a bribe of Rs. 7 lakhs which had been agreed to and accepted by them, after negotiations with terrorists and their associates.	Facts
Thus, they have been charged u s 3(3) TADA.	Facts
After conclusion of the trial, the learned Designated Court held the Appellants guilty and awarded punishment as referred to hereinabove.	Facts
Hence, these appeals.	Facts
324.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri P.K. Dey, learned Counsel appearing for the Appellants, has submitted that sufficient evidence on record does not exist to convict the Appellants.	Arguments of Petitioner
In their confessional statements, Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30) and Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82), have not made any reference to the smuggling of arms and ammunition, infact, they have spoken of the smuggling of silver.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the question of framing any charge against the present Appellants under TADA, in view of such confessional statements could not arise.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, the memorandum annexed to the confessional statement is a part and parcel of the confession, and the same has to be filled up simultaneously, and not subsequently.	Arguments of Petitioner
So far as the confessional statement of Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30) is concerned, the said memorandum had been sent subsequently.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, the same was in violation of the statutory provisions of TADA and, the TADA Rules, particularly, as the same was not in compliance with the requirements of Sections 15(3)(b) and 15(5) of the TADA Rules.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said confessional statement required a certificate under Rule 15(4), and such a certificate was not annexed by the officer recording the confessional statements of Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30), Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82) and Salim Kutta (A134).	Arguments of Petitioner
The confessional statement of Salim Kutta (A134) was recorded on 19.8.1995, and the same was sent to the CMM on 24.8.1995.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the same is not valid.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has also been contended that after the recording of the confession on 19.8.1995 at Ahmedabad, Salim Kutta (A134) had been brought to Bombay by the CBI to the STF office, and that subsequently, he had been taken back to Ahmedabad on 24.8.1995 and that here, he was produced before the CMM Ahmedabad.	Arguments of Petitioner
325.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondent, has submitted that these two Appellants have failed to perform their duty.	Arguments of Respondent
They had not checked the boxes, they had only counted the bricks in the trucks.	Arguments of Respondent
The previous amount of bribe of Rs. 25,000/ was enhanced to a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs after a negotiation of about half an hour.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, the matter is not one of mere negligence, but of intentional facilitation of the accused persons in the smuggling of arms and ammunition into the country.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.	Reasoning
Evidence against the Appellants Confessional statement of Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30) Confessional statements of Dawood Taklya (A14) and Dadabhai (A17)	None
Confessional statement of Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82)	Reasoning
Confessional statement of Salim Kutta (A134) Confessional statement of Mechanic Chacha (A136) Deposition of Dilip Bhiku Pansare (PW97) Deposition of Yeshwant Kadam (PW109) Deposition of Pramod Mudbhatkal (PW681) Deposition of other witnesses Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30), Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82), Salim Kutta (A134) and Mechanic Chacha (A136) in their confessional statements, while narrating the incident of the interception of trucks at Gondghar Phata, have stated the presence of 57 police officials in the party, headed by VK Patil (A116), though they have not specifically named the Appellants.	None
This police party further allowed the goods to go past, without proper checking after negotiating a bribe to the tune of Rs. 7 lakhs.	None
As the smugglers did not have said amount of Rs. 7 lakhs with them at the said time, they had given five silver bricks that had been smuggled in the landing, to the police as security and subsequently, upon making them payment of the said amount to the officials, the silver bricks had been returned to the smugglers.	None
Confessional statement of Uttam Potdar (A30) He has stated that on 9.1.1993, at night, after the smuggling of the goods, they had been intercepted by the Shrivardhan police near Gondghar Phata.	None
Upon inquiry, Shri Patil (A116), SI of the Shrivardhan Police Station, had asked Salim (A134) why the money promised to them had not been paid, as regards the earlier landing.	None
Uttam Potdar (A30) had told him that he had given the said money to Ramesh Mali Hawaldar.	None
SI Patil (A116) had seemed very annoyed.	None
Mechanic Chacha (A136) had then offered a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs to Hawaldar Ramesh Dattatray Mali (A101) and Hawaldar Ashok Narayan Muneshwar (A70), who were counting the silver bricks that had been loaded into the truck.	None
There were 175 bricks in one truck, and in the other, there were about 100 bricks and also some boxes.	None
Upon being asked by the Hawaldar to reveal the contents of the boxes, Mechanic Chacha (A136) had said that the boxes contained watches and that as there was no cash, Mechanic Chacha (A136) had taken out five silver bricks from the first truck and had given them to Pashilkar, policeman.	None
Thus, Uttam Potdar (A30) has specifically named the Appellant, (A70) as a member of the party who had counted the silver bricks.	None
Confessional statement of Jayawant Keshav Gurav (A82)	Reasoning
In his confessional statement, he has corroborated the confession of Uttam Potdar (A30), pointing out that he had also reached the place where the police had intercepted the two trucks carrying the smuggled goods, and that at such time, the police SubInspector Patil had asked Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82) what should be done, and that the police thereafter, upon negotiating for about half an hour had, released the detained trucks.	None
Dawood Taklya (A14) and Dadabhai (A17) in their confessional statements, have revealed that a sum of Rs.	None
25,000/ each had been given on two separate occasions to the Shrivardhan Police Station to seek assistance in the organisation of the landings.	None
Salim Kutta (A134) and Mechanic Chacha (A136) have supported the case of the prosecution, and have corroborated the confessions of Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30) and Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82).	None
Deposition of Dilip Bhiku Pansare (PW97) In his deposition, he has revealed that he had participated in the landing with Uttam Potdar (A30).	None
He had been driving the truck carrying the smuggled goods on 9.1.1993 from Dighi Jetty, and he has corroborated the confessional statement of Uttam Potdar (A30) to the extent that Pashilkar (A110) had taken the key to his vehicle, and that after checking the contents of their truck, some police personnel had shouted out that the same was silver.	None
Mechanic Chacha (A136) had also come there and he had negotiated with Vijay Krishanji Patil (A116) who had also been present at that time.	None
Uttam Potdar (A30), Jayant Keshav Gurav (A82) from Customs and Mechanic Chacha (A136) etc. had talked to the police for about half an hour, and as the smuggling party did not have cash with them, five silver bricks had been given as security to them.	None
The police had searched the first truck for a long time, while they had taken only 10 minutes to check the second one.	None
The Appellant (A70) had produced a sum of Rs. 30,000/ on 24.4.1993 in presence of two witnesses, namely, Yeshwant Kadam (PW109) and Vinod Chavan (PW590), who had been brought by his fatherinlaw, and in this respect, a panchnama (Ext. 565) was prepared.	None
As regards the same, Yeshwant Kadam (PW109) has deposed that he had been unable to identify the accused who had produced the said cash, which had been seized under the panchnama (Exh. 565) in court.	None
The Appellants (A99) house had been searched in the presence of the panch witnesses Yeshwant Kadam (PW109) and Chandrashekhar (PW622), who were policemen, and from the said house, a sum of Rs. 59,200/ had been recovered.	None
In this respect, a panchnama was prepared in the presence of the aforementioned two panch witnesses.	None
Sujjat Peoplankar (PW158), Bhaskar Boda (PW159), Gopichand Sathnag (PW160), Tukaram Kalankar (PW161), Ganpat Giri (PW162), Anant Lad (PW166) and Dhiryasheel Koltharkar (PW167) have deposed, that both the Appellants (A70 and A99) had not come to their village on patrolling duty.	None
These witnesses were produced by the prosecution to disprove the version of the defences alibi, to the extent that they had not been present in the police party which had intercepted the smuggled goods, rather, they had been on patrolling duty.	None
The present Appellants (A70 and A99) may be correct in contending that simply because these witnesses had not seen the Appellants in their village, the same cannot be taken to mean that the Appellants had not been on patrolling duty.	None
Deposition of Pramod Mudbhatkal (PW681)	None
He was an officer of the CBI who had been associated with the investigation of the Bombay Blast.	None
He has deposed that Omprakash Chhatwal (PW684) had been a member of the team investigating the Bombay Blast.	None
Pramod Mudbhatkal (PW681) had arrested Mechanic Chacha (A136) under the supervision of Omprakash Chhatwal (PW684), and that he (PW684), had recorded the confessional statement of Mechanic Chacha (A136) and that Pramod Madbhatkal (PW681) had requested him (PW684) to record his confessional statement and that he had chosen him because he (PW684) was conversant with the matter.	None
After appreciating the evidence on record, the learned Designated Court came to the conclusion that the police party of Shrivardhan had intercepted the convoy carrying said contraband near Gondghar Phata.	None
The entry in the log book of the police jeep has revealed that the same had been driven by the Appellant (A99), and this has not been disputed by the Appellant (A99).	None
Hence, it is clear that Appellant (A99) had been driving the said police jeep when the party was headed by Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116).	None
Furthermore, it has been held that the confessions of the coaccused and of Dilip Bhiku Pansare (PW97) clearly reveal the involvement of the Appellants in the landing episode.	None
It has also been held that the Appellants had infact been members of the police party headed by their superior Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116), and that though the Appellants cannot be held to be responsible for taking the decision to permit the further transportation of said goods, however, taking into account the fact that they had not reported Vijay Krishnaji Patils (A116) behaviour to higher officials, and further, the recovery of a large amount of money from them, clearly reveals that they had also connived with Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116) to commit the said acts.	None
Thus, they are liable u s 3(3) TADA.	None
However, as Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116), was primarily responsible for the decision taken by the police party and also for the handling of the negotiations, the Appellants cannot be held guilty for commission of the offence of conspiracy, as they were acting in accordance with the instructions and directions of Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116).	None
We find no cogent reason to interfere with the decision of the learned Designated Court.	Decision
The appeals lack merit and are accordingly dismissed.	Decision
Criminal Appeal No. 403 of 2011 This appeal has been preferred against the Respondents only on the limited issue that the Respondents have been acquitted by the Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA for the charge of conspiracy.	None
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the AppellantState has submitted that these Respondents were police constables who had been posted at the relevant time at the Shrivardhan Police Station.	Arguments of Petitioner
They had intercepted the contraband (arms, ammunition and explosives etc.) at Gondghar Phata.	Arguments of Petitioner
They had checked the two trucks carrying the said contraband for about 15 and 10 minutes respectively, and that despite the fact that the arms had been packed differently as compared to the silver, they had omitted to inspect the said goods properly.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, the fact that that they had asked for enhancement of the amount of bribe to be paid to the police for each landing, indicates that they were aware of the contents of the contraband (arms, ammunition and explosives) as well, which gave them this bargaining power.	Arguments of Petitioner
Furthermore, the Customs Inspector had issued a warning to all authorities, stating that he had definite information that arms and ammunition would be brought in by sea, owing to which they should remain alert and ensure proper checking.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, they ought to have been convicted for the charge of conspiracy as well.	Arguments of Petitioner
342.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the contrary, Shri P.K. Dey, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents, has submitted that since the Respondents had been subordinate to the actual recipients of the bribes, which had been taken to facilitate the landing of the contraband, they themselves had been unaware of the fact that arms and ammunition could have been brought into the country once the vehicles had been checked.	Arguments of Respondent
They may have been negligent in the performance of their duties, but by no stretch of the imagination, can it be held that they had also conspired in the execution of the transaction.	Arguments of Respondent
They have been convicted u s 3(3) TADA and their appeals have been heard alongwith this appeal.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, no further consideration is required, particularly keeping in mind the parameters that have been laid down by this Court for interference against an order of acquittal.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, this appeal is liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.	Reasoning
After appreciating the entire evidence, the learned Special Judge reached a conclusion that though these Respondentsconstables may have been negligent in the performance of their duties, they cannot be held to be parties to the conspiracy.	None
The learned Special Judge has taken a view that as their presence had been established at the place of interception, a case u s 3(3) TADA can be established as a result of the cumulative effect of the said evidence.	None
However, in view of the fact that there is nothing on record to show their involvement in the conspiracy, or of them having committed any overt acts in the execution of such conspiracy, the question of convicting them for conspiracy does not arise.	None
As their acts do not transcend beyond their presence and their negligence in the interception and checking of the vehicles, they are entitled to the benefit of doubt as far as the conspiracy is concerned.	None
All the constables were of inferior ranks, and were acting under the instructions of the officers who had been present at the spot.	None
Despite the fact that all the four Respondents had been members of the police party, and were hence responsible for allowing the further transportation of the smuggled contraband goods, there appears to exist some distinction between the cases of the said accused, and of Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116), the head of the police party, without whose consent and connivance the said goods could not have been permitted to be transported any further.	None
Therefore, in his presence, the Respondentsconstables cannot be held as responsible for taking the decision to permit the further transportation of the said goods.	None
Thus, they are liable only for the offences punishable u s 3(3) TADA.	None
We are fully aware of our limitation to interfere with an order against acquittal.	None
In exceptional cases where there are compelling circumstances and the judgment under appeal is found to be perverse, the appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal.	Reasoning
The appellate court should bear in mind the presumption of innocence of the accused and further that the trial Courts acquittal bolsters the presumption of his innocence.	Reasoning
Interference in a routine manner where the other view is possible should be avoided, unless there are good reasons for interference.	Reasoning

Darshan Singh Darshan Lal, We have given our conscious thought to the said reasoning that has been given by the learned Designated Court, and we are of the view that the same does not require any interference.	None
The appeal lacks merit and is dismissed accordingly.	Decision

The bomb blast was the outcome of the desire of the God.	None
After considering the evidence on record, the Designated Court recorded the finding as under That initially A85 himself was not aware regarding the material which was stored in the said godown.	None
After being shown the relevant material he had become aware of the nature of contraband material.	None
Still he did not take any steps regarding the same i.e. informing to the police, etc.	None
His said acts would definitely amount of having committed the offence u s 3(3) TADA having regard to wide definition of abetment given under TADA.	None

In view of the same A85 could not be held guilty for commission of offence u s 5 TADA for which he is charged with.	None
The same was the case regarding commission of offence u s 6 TADA for which he is charged with.	None
However, he himself still having allowed to continue the said material in his godown till the same was taken away by Tiger Memon, would make him liable for commission of offence u s 5 read with Section 6 of Explosive Substances Act.	None
A85 was found guilty mainly due to few incidental acts committed by him in connection with contraband goods smuggled during Shekhadi landings.	None
The evidence surfaced and or reasoning given thereon revealed that A85 was closely related to absconding accused Yeda Yakoob and deceased accused Majid Khan i.e. nephew of said persons.	None

He had not committed any act either with landing or with any of other operations effected in pursuance of conspiracy.	None
Needless to add that evidence having denoted that the material stored at the godown being later on taken away by Tiger Memon, A85 cannot be also said to have in possession of such contraband material.	None
However, to the limited extent A85 had committed offence u s 3(3) TADA.	None

Hence, the State has preferred this appeal.	Issue
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant, has submitted that in spite of the fact that there was clear cut evidence against the Respondent of his involvement in the conspiracy, he has wrongly been acquitted by the Designated Court.	Arguments of Petitioner

362.	Arguments of Petitioner

Arguments of Respondent
He was neither the owner of the godown nor did he have any control over it.	Arguments of Respondent
It belongs to his father who had never been an accused.	Arguments of Respondent

Heard learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.	None
Confessional statements of A18, A85 and A130 have already been referred to and appreciated in the connected appeal.	None
The Designated Court has dealt with the issue elaborately and recorded the findings as under Thus, considering material in the confession of A85 and aforesaid coaccused the same leads to the conclusion of A85 though was not involved in Shekhadi landing operation he was involved in allowing his place i.e. godown of his father for storing explosive substances in large quantities.	None
However, considering the manner in which A85 had figured in commission of the relevant acts it will be difficult to come to the conclusion that he was involved in the conspiracy for which the charge at head 1stly is framed or even otherwise.	None
Hence, he will be required to be held not guilty of the said offence due to not only paucity of evidence for the same but his involvement being not even spelt for the same.	None
The parameters laid down by this Court in entertaining the appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.	Reasoning
In view thereof, we do not find any cogent reason to interfere with the judgment of the Designated Court.	Decision

Hence, this appeal.	Facts
Mr. Sushil Kumar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant (A102), has submitted that the Appellant (A102) has been acquitted of the first charge of general conspiracy, and a finding of fact has been recorded by the Designated Court, that there was no evidence on record to show that the Appellant had accepted any bribe from any of the smugglers or their landing agents etc.	Arguments of Petitioner
The confessional statement of the Appellant has been rejected by the Designated Court on the ground that it was recorded by the Inspector of Police, and such person has not been accepted as a competent authority u s 15 TADA, to record such statement.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, such a confession cannot be taken into consideration.	Arguments of Petitioner
Eight coaccused in their confessional statements have named the Appellant stating that the landing agents of the smugglers had been in contact with him and that they had been paying to him, amounts as were fixed per landing.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, the statements of three coaccused i.e. Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30), Mohmed Salim Mira Moiddin Shaikh Salim Kutta (A134) and Mohmed Kasam Lajpuria Mechanic Chacha (A136) were recorded subsequent to the date of amendment dated 22.5.1993.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the confessional statements of five other coaccused, which were recorded prior to the date of the said amendment, cannot be relied upon.	Arguments of Petitioner
The contents of the confessional statements of the aforementioned three coaccused do not inspire confidence and cannot be relied upon.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Appellant (A102) has wrongly been convicted u s 3(3) TADA and awarded a sentence of 9 years alongwith a fine of Rs. 3 lakhs.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Appellant has already served about 7 years of imprisonment, and has also deposited the fine.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, other officers of the Customs Department were also convicted in this case, particularly, Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82), Mohmed Sultan Sayyed (A90), Somnath Kakaram Thapa (A112) (dead) and Sudhanwa Sadashiv Talwadekar (A113), and among them, Somnath Kakaram Thapa (A112) (dead) who was a superior officers to the Appellant (A102), and also others who were his subordinates, have been awarded a lesser sentence.	Arguments of Petitioner
A sentence of 8 years was awarded to Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82) and of seven years to Mohmed Sultan Sayyed (A90).	Arguments of Petitioner
Hence, his sentence should be reduced to the period already undergone.	Arguments of Petitioner
410.	None
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondent, has vehemently opposed the appeal contending that the confessional statements of all the coaccused, though recorded prior to the date of amendment, must be relied upon.	Arguments of Respondent
The Collector of Customs Shiv Kumar Bhardwaj (PW470) informed the Appellant (A102) over the telephone on 25.1.1993 that he (PW470) had received definite information through Intelligence that arms and ammunition would be smuggled into India alongwith silver and gold and that landings of the same would take place within the territorial jurisdiction of the Appellant (A102).	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, he must take all necessary precautions and seize both, the weapons as well as the contraband silver and gold.	Arguments of Respondent
Undoubtedly, the Appellant (A102) regularly informed the Collector about the progress made by him in this regard, but did not take any actual effective measures, instead, he spent his time bargaining and taking bribes from the smugglers, to facilitate the landing and transportation of the said goods.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, no leniency must be shown to him.	Arguments of Respondent
The appeal is liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.	Reasoning
The confessional statement made by the Appellant has rightly been rejected by the Designated Court, and we do not wish to spend further time on this issue.	None

Appellant (A102) knew about the landing which took place on 3.2.1993 and 7.2.1993 at Shekhadi.  	None
Appellant had received the information from Sh.	None
Bhardwaj, Collector of Custom on 25.1.1993 that I.S.I. Syndicate located in Middle East and Bombay may try to smuggle contraband and arms in the Districts of Bombay, Raigad and Thane.	None
Despite this specific information he allowed Tiger Memon (AA) and his persons to smuggle arms, explosives etc. in India.	None
After considering the entire evidence on record, the learned Special Judge came to the conclusion as under Without making any unnecessary dilation about the selfeloquent evidence about which the relevant excerpts are cited earlier it can be safely said that considering the act committed by these 4 accused as reflected from same i.e. participation of A102 90 in Persian Darbar meeting and negotiating with smugglers about the bribe amount to be paid and granting them a charter to smuggle the contraband articles or in fact any thing, the act of A82 inspite of being present on the spot of interception of goods by police, instead of seizing the same allowing the same to be transported further and in most clandestine manner piloting the convoy carrying the contraband goods on its way to destination uptil a particular spot, advising the policemen in clandestine manner etc., and of A113 though not being directly connected with said landing readily willingly accepting his share of booty from the bribe amount received for the said landing and thereby denoting his implied connivance for the said operation seized earlier not revealed otherwise in view of himself being not directly involvement in commission of act and considering the further acts committed by A90, 82 and 113 regarding Shekadi landing and so also to some extent byA102 clearly reveals themselves having committed the offence u s 3(3) of TADA for which each of them has been charged with at this trial.	None
However, the careful consideration of said evidence and even after taking into consideration the fact that A102 and A90 had participated in Persian Darbar meeting still the evidence having fall short of themselves having connived with the conspirators in this case for commission of said act for the purposes of conspiracy, it will be difficult to hold them or an of them liable for offence of conspiracy for which each of them has been charged with on the basis of evidence surfaced regarding Dighi landing episode and so also about Shekadi landing episode about which the discussion is made later on.	None
Truly speaking receipt of bribe amount for allowing the said operation considered from proper angle also connotes that the act committed by the A102, 90, 113 82 being primarily for receipt of bribe amount by misusing abusing their official position would definitely fallout of sphere of the conspiracy for which the relevant operation was organized and effected by other coaccused.	None
The same is obvious as conspirators always join the conspiracy or become members of conspiracy due to being interested in either furthering the object of conspiracy or achieving the object of conspiracy.	None
The payment of the money for commission of act which may have a semblance of furthering object of conspiracy will still not make the concerned liable for offence of conspiracy.	None
The same is apparent as the act committed by them would be for the purposes of receiving the said payment and not mainly for furthering the object of conspiracy.	None
It is true that their such acts as ruled earlier would amount to commission of offence of an abetment or assistance et for commission of terrorist act by other conspirators and they could be held liable for the same but still they cannot be said to be involved in the conspiracy.	None
In view of the aforesaid, none of the A102, 90, 113 82 can be said to be guilty for commission of offences of conspiracy for which the charge at head 1stly is framed against them or even otherwise for any smaller conspiracy.	None
However, by way of abundant caution it will be necessary to record that aforesaid observations is limited to above stated 4 accused from Customs dept., and the same is not in relation to A102 i.e. Addl.	None
Collector of Customs whose case clearly appears to be different i.e. his connection with Tiger Memon being spelt from evidence revealed during Shekadi landing, there being hardly any evidence of himself having received There is enough evidence on record to show the involvement of the Appellant (A102) in facilitating the smuggling of arms, ammunition and explosives within his jurisdiction in lieu of payment of illegal gratification.

2nd	None
ly clause b.	None
Since case of A113 is more so over akin regarding his liability to Shekhadi landing with that of A82 as both of them were at Shekhadi coast instead of again repeating said discussion it can be safely said that for same reason of which A82 has been found guilty for commission of offence u s 3(3) of TADA Act A113 will be required to be held guilty.	None
Needless to add that for same reason as stated in said discussion evidence pertaining to receipt of bribe amount and or recovery of same during course of investigation and as tabulated about is not threadbare discussed.	None
Thus on basis of all material surfaced at trial A113 will be required to be held guilty for commission of offence u s 3(3) of TADA Act.	None
Needless to add that similarly as that of A82 or even A102 he can not be held guilty for offence of conspiracy for which he is charged with.	None
(Emphasis added)	None
The evidence on record clearly shows the involvement of the Appellant in landing.	None
His role is the same as that of Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A82) as he was responsible to prevent any smuggling, rather he had indulged in that and accepted the bribe permitting the smugglers to bring not only gold and silver but also arms, ammunition and explosives.	None
The fact of investment of money taken by him as illegal gratification stood proved by the evidence of Bharat Hiramal Jain (PW165) and Deepak Balkrishna Rauth (PW149) and he could not furnish any satisfactory explanation for such investment.	None
The learned Designated Court has rightly reached the conclusion so far as his involvement in the offence punishable u s 3(3) TADA is concerned.	None
In view of the above, we do not find any force in the appeal.	Decision
The appeal lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.	Decision
This appeal has been preferred by the State against the final judgment and order dated 2.8.2007 passed by Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA in the Bombay Blast Case No. 1 of 1993, by which the Respondents accused (A82, A90, A102, A113) have been convicted for the offences punishable under various provisions of TADA and other Acts, but have been acquitted of the general charge of conspiracy under TADA.	Issue
In view of the fact that each Respondent being assigned different acts, has been charged differently and has been awarded a different sentence, it is desirable to deal with the case of each Respondent separately to certain extent.	Issue
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State, has submitted that all the four Respondents, were officials of the Customs Department.	Arguments of Petitioner
They had been warned by their superior officers that arms and ammunition were going to be smuggled into the country through the sea and they were therefore, required to take all possible preventive measures and to remain constantly alert.	Arguments of Petitioner
Despite the said warnings, the Respondents demanded higher bribes from the smugglers for the purpose of permitting their landings and transportation, and therefore, they ought to have been convicted for the first charge of conspiracy as well.	Arguments of Petitioner
451.	None
Per contra, Ms. Farhana Shah, Shri Mushtaq Ahmad and Ms. Afshani Pracha, learned Counsel for the Respondents, have submitted that the Respondents have already been convicted under various Acts, and considering the participation of the individual Respondents in the said crimes, punishments have been awarded to them, as deemed appropriate.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, no further sentence is required.	None
We have considered the rival submissions made by learned Counsel for the parties and perused the record.	Reasoning
Jayawant Keshav Gaurav (A82)	None
The first Respondent has been charged, in addition to the main charge of conspiracy, for facilitating the transportation of arms and ammunition by piloting two motor trucks laden with arms, ammunition and explosives, in order to ensure safe passage of the same, in a jeep belonging to the Customs Department, bearing registration No.	None
BLB 4352, from Gondghar Phata to Kanghar, and for permitting the accused Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30), to drive the aforesaid government jeep for the said purpose on the intervening night between 9th/10th January, 1993.	None
The said acts amount to the abetment of Mohd.	None
Dossa and his associates for smuggling arms, ammunition and explosives, which were brought into the country for the commission of terrorist acts, and hence, abetment of the said attacks.	None
Additionally, he has been charged for facilitating the smuggling and transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives by Tiger Memon (AA), on the 3rd and 7th February, 1993.	Facts
Thus, the charge is one u s 3(3) TADA.	None
He (A82) has been convicted u s 3(3) TADA and has been awarded RI of 8 years alongwith a fine of Rs. 1 lakh, and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo RI for 3 years.	Facts
He has filed Criminal Appeal No. 271 of 2008 against the said order of conviction, even though he has served the sentence for a period of 8 years, and has paid the fine.	None
The learned Designated Court, after appreciating the entire evidence on record, came to the conclusion that the confessional statement of Jayawant Keshav Gaurav (A82) has revealed his involvement in the Shekhadi landing, and in the transportation of the smuggled contraband, alongwith various other coaccused, particularly, Dawood Taklya (A14), Uttam Shantaram Potdar (A30), Ranjit Kumar Singh Baleshwar Prasad (A102), Sudhanwa Sadashiv Talwadekar (A113), Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A116) and Tiger Memon (AA) and has held as under Since all the said material is so self eloquent that same will need no dilation for coming to conclusion as stated aforesaid.	None
Amongst other the same reveals that A82 being participant in commission of offence regarding Dighi landing.	None
A82 being also recipient of bribe amount.	None
A82 alongwith A113 being present at Shekhadi coast when landing was to be effected hardly they had taken any steps for preventing same and on the contrary their conversation with Tiger Memon clearly reveals that instead of taking matter seriously they were interested in making fun of Government missionary to which they were party and were required to act diligently for protecting economy of Nation.	None
However as observed earlier and taking into account act committed by A82 who was of lower rank of officers of Customs Department of which higher officers were involved in conspiracy he can not be said to be guilty for offence of conspiracy for which charge at head 1stly is framed against him at the trial.	None
Needless to add that same is apparent that there is paucity of evidence regarding knowledge of A82 of contraband goods being arms, ammunition and explosives and purposes for which same was brought.	None
So also he can not be said to be guilty for offence of conspiracy for serial blast as acts committed by him was much prior than even fixing of targets for serial blast by Tiger Memon.	None
Such conclusion is further fortified by fact of A82 having not found to have committed any other act after said landing and excepting act of nabbing culprits which would never have been feasible in view of he himself having abetted acts committed by them.	None
The aforesaid findings by the learned Special Judge make it crystal clear, that he (A82) was guilty of facilitating such landings and transportation as being a Customs Inspector, he was the recipient of a bribe amount.	None
He (A82) had conversations with Tiger Memon (AA) and had further allowed Uttam Potdar (A30) to drive a customs car.	None
However, as he (A82) was an officer of a lower rank in the Customs Department, it was his superior officers who were actually involved in the conspiracy.	None
His involvement was to the extent of the offence punishable u s 3(3) TADA, which includes conspiracy to a certain extent, as well as of offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code the Explosives Act the Explosives Substances Act and the Arms Act etc.	Facts
Thus, despite the fact that he himself had been involved in abetting the landing and transportation of contraband, he could not be held guilty of the larger conspiracy.	None
The appeal with respect to Jayawant Gauruv (A82) was hence, dismissed.	None
II.	Issue
Mohd.	None
Sultan Sayyad (A90)	None
In addition to the main charge of conspiracy, he was also charged for attending the meeting that had been held at Hotel Persian Darbar on 6.1.1993, alongwith coaccused Ranjit Kumar Singh Baleshwar Prasad (A102) and Customs Superintendent Lotle (PW154).	None
At the said meeting, he (A90) had allowed Mohd.	None

After meeting Tiger Memon (AA) and his associates at Hotel Big Splash on 2.2.1992, he had further facilitated the landings of arms, ammunition and explosives at Shekhadi on 3.2.1993 and 7.2.1993.	None
He has been convicted u s 3(3) and has been awarded a punishment of 7 years RI alongwith a fine of Rs. 1 lakh, and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo RI for 3 years.	Issue
He has already served the sentence and deposited the fine.	None
After appreciating the entire evidence on record, the learned Special judge came to the conclusion that Truly speaking receipt of bribe amount for allowing the said operation considered from proper angle also connotes that the act committed by A102, 90, 113 82 being primarily for receipt of bribe amount by misusing abusing their official position would definitely fall out of sphere of the conspiracy for which the relevant operation was organized and effected by other coconspirators for commission of terrorist act.	None
The same is obvious as conspirators always join the conspiracy or become members of conspiracy due to being interested in either furthering the object of conspiracy or achieving the object of conspiracy.	None
The payment of the money for commission of act which may have a semblance of furthering object of conspiracy will still not make the concerned liable for offence of conspiracy.	None
The same is apparent as the act committed by them would be for the purposes of receiving the said payment and not mainly for furthering the object of conspiracy.	None
It is true that their such acts as ruled earlier would amount to commission of offence of an abetment or assistance etc. for commission of terrorist act by other conspirators and they could be held liable for the same but still they cannot be said to be involved in the conspiracy.	None
In view of the aforesaid, none of the A102, 90, 113 82 can be said to be guilty for commission of offences of conspiracy for which the charge at head 1stly is framed against them or even otherwise for any smaller conspiracy.	None
However, by way of abundant caution it will necessary to record that aforesaid observations is limited to above stated accused from Customs dept., and the same is not in relation to A112.	None
As the learned Special Judge has dealt with the said issue elaborately and has placed the Respondents at par, we do not see any cogent reason to take a view contrary to the view that has been taken in the case of the coaccused Jayawant Keshav Gaurav (A82).	None
III.	Facts
Ranjitkumar Singh Baleshwar Prasad (A102)	None
In addition to the general charge of conspiracy, he (A102) has been charged similarly to accused (A90), for attending the meeting that was held on 6.1.1993 at Hotel Persian Darbar alongwith the other accused, and for thereafter allowing the smugglers to continue their smuggling activities within their territorial jurisdiction in lieu of payment of Rs. 7.80 lakhs per landing.	None
In furtherance thereof, the contraband, including arms and ammunition were smuggled into India, on 9.1.1993 within the limits of their territorial jurisdiction.	None
He was further charged with facilitating the transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives on 3.2.1993 and 7.2.1993.	None
Thus, he has been convicted u s 3(3) TADA and has been awarded the punishment of imprisonment for 9 years, alongwith a fine of Rs. 3 lakhs, and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo RI for a period of 4 years.	Issue
The Respondent (A102) has presently served out more than five years of the punishment awarded to him and has also deposited the fine.	None
After considering the entire evidence on record, the learned Special Judge came to the conclusion as under Without making any unnecessary dilation about the selfeloquent evidence about which the relevant excerpts are cited earlier it can be safely said that considering the act committed by these 4 accused as reflected from same i.e. participation of A102 90 in Persian Darbar meeting and negotiating with smugglers about the bribe amount to be paid and granting them a charter to smuggle the contraband articles or in fact any thing, the act of A82 inspite of being present on the spot of interception of goods by police, instead of seizing the same allowing the same to be transported further and in most clandestine manner piloting the convoy carrying the contraband goods on its way to destination uptil a particular spot, advising the policemen in clandestine manner etc., and of A113 though not being directly connected with said landing readily willingly accepting his share of booty from the bribe amount received for the said landing and thereby denoting his implied connivance for the said operation seized earlier not revealed otherwise in view of himself being not directly involvement in commission of act and considering the further acts committed by A90, 82 and 113 regarding Shekadi landing and so also to some extent byA102 clearly reveals themselves having committed the offence u s 3(3) of TADA for which each of them has been charged with at this trial.	None
However, the careful consideration of said evidence and even after taking into consideration the fact that A102 and A90 had participated in Persian Darbar meeting still the evidence having fall short of themselves having connived with the conspirators in this case for commission of said act for the purposes of conspiracy, it will be difficult to hold them or an of them liable for offence of conspiracy for which each of them has been charged with on the basis of evidence surfaced regarding Dighi landing episode and so also about Shekadi landing episode about which the discussion is made later on.	None
Truly speaking receipt of bribe amount for allowing the said operation considered from proper angle also connotes that the act committed by the A102, 90, 113 82 being primarily for receipt of bribe amount by misusing abusing their official position would definitely fallout of sphere of the conspiracy for which the relevant operation was organized and effected by other coaccused.

Since case of A113 is more so over akin regarding his liability to Shekhadi landing with that of A82 as both of them were at Shekhadi coast instead of again repeating said discussion it can be safely said that for same reason of which A82 has been found guilty for commission of offence u s 3(3) 3(3) of TADA Act A113 will be required to be held guilty.

(Ext. 162).	None
The signature of the accused is not required on the seizure memo.	None
In State of West Bengal Vs.	None
Kailash Chandra Pandey, , this Court held The first reason given by learned Single Judge was that no signature of the accused was taken on the seizure list.	None
It has been stated by the prosecution witnesses i.e. by the investigating officers that the accused refused to sign on the seizure list.	None
No accused can be forced to put his signature and the prosecution cannot force him to append his signature on the seizure memo if he refused to sign.	None
Therefore, just because the accused did not append the signature on the seizure memo that cannot be a ground to improbabilise the prosecution story.	None
Similarly, in State of Rajasthan Vs.	None
Teja Ram and Others, this Court held as under Learned Counsel in this context invited our attention to one step which PW 21 (investigating officer) had adopted while preparing the seizurememos Ex.	None
P3 and Ex. P4.	None
He obtained the signature of the accused concerned in both the seizurememos.	None
According to the learned Counsel, the aforesaid action of the investigating officer was illegal and it has vitiated the seizure.	None
He invited our attention to Section 162(1) of the Code which prohibits collecting of signature of the person whose statement was reduced to writing during interrogation No doubt the aforesaid prohibition is in peremptory terms.	None
It is more a direction to the investigating officer than to the court because the policy underlying the rule is to keep witnesses free to testify in court unhampered by anything which the police claim to have elicited from them.	None
Tahsildar Singh and Another Vs.	None
The State of Uttar Pradesh, and Ch.	None
Razik Ram Vs.	None
Ch.	None
Jaswant Singh Chouhan and Others, .	None
But if any investigating officer, ignorant of the said provision, secures the signature of the person concerned in the statement, it does not mean that the witnesss testimony in the court would thereby become contaminated or vitiated.	None
The court will only reassure the witness that he is not bound by such statement albeit his signature finding a place thereon.	None
That apart, the prohibition contained in Subsection (1) of Section 162 is not applicable to any proceedings made as per Section 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872	None
The resultant position is that the investigating officer is not obliged to obtain the signature of an accused in any statement attributed to him while preparing seizurememo for the recovery of any article covered by Section 27 of the Evidence Act.	None
But if any signature has been obtained by an investigating officer, there is nothing wrong or illegal about it The submission made by Shri Mushtaq Ahmad that the evidence of recovery cannot be relied upon for the reason that the same did not bear the signature of the Appellant accused (A42), is not worthy of being accepted Vide State of Rajasthan v. Teja Ram and Ors., (supra) and Prasad Ramakant Khade Vs.	None
State of Maharashtra, After appreciating the evidence on record, the learned Designated Court came to the conclusion that the confession of the Appellant (A42) revealed that on 3.02.1993, Dawood Taklya (A14) had informed him that a landing would take place in the evening, and thereafter, the Appellant (A42), Nazir (AA) and Dawood Taklya (A14) had gone to Shekhadi Coast.	None
Thereafter, the Appellant (A42) had gone to the village of Borli to bring back men and a truck for the landing, and he had returned to the coast in the truck of Rashid Umar Kadri (A27) with A27, Sajjad Alam Iqbal Abdul Hakim Nazir (A61), Bashir Ahmed Usman Gani Khairulla (A13), Sharif Khan Abbas Adhikari (A60), Muzammil Umar Kadri (A25) and Azim Pardeshi at midnight.	None
The landed goods were taken to Wangni Tower.	None
At the tower, the same were loaded into tempos and jeeps, and the Appellant (A42) sat by the side of the driver.	None
The contraband items were then taken to Bombay, and the Appellant (A42) was told by Hasan and Azim that said goods were not silver, but rifles, handgrenades, black soap and cartridges.	None
On 22.03.1993, Dawood (A14) came to house of the Appellant (A42) and gave to him, one bag telling him that it contained 2 revolvers.	None
Dawood (A14) disclosed to the police that he kept the said revolvers with the Appellant (A42), and the same were recovered from the Appellant (A42).	None
Therefore, the learned Designated Court held that the aforesaid evidence lead to the inescapable conclusion that the Appellant (A42) was involved in the Shekhadi landing operations and had committed offences punishable under sections as mentioned hereinabove.	None
Having regard to the fact that Dawood Dawood Taklya (A14) had chosen the Appellant for the purpose of keeping 2 revolvers with him and the fact that the Appellant (A42) had readily kept the same, reveals that he was a man in which the prime accused had confidence with respect to the conspiracy.	None
However, since he had committed the aforementioned relevant acts much prior to the date of the bomb blasts and had not participated in any meetings, nor was he connected with the same in any manner, and the fact that the acts were committed by him at a time when even the targets of the Bomb blasts had not been fixed, he could not be held guilty for the offence of larger conspiracy i.e. first charge.	None
We find no cogent reason to interfere with the decision of the Designated Court.	Decision
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.	Decision
Criminal Appeal No. 1035 of 2012 The Respondent in this appeal stood acquitted of the charge of conspiracy.	None
Hence, the State preferred this appeal.	Issue
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the AppellantState has submitted that the evidence against him has been his own confession, wherein he had admitted his role in the facilitation of the landing and transportation of contraband goods from Shekhadi, alongwith Tiger Memon (AA) and his associates.	Arguments of Petitioner
The said contraband was transported by Tiger Memon (AA) into Bombay, and further, the aforesaid arms were recovered from his residence.	Arguments of Petitioner
The confessional statement of the Respondent has been corroborated by the confessional statements of Dawood Taklya (A14), Sharif Abdul Gafoor Parkar Dadabhai (A17), Muzammil Umar Kadri (A25), Rashid Umar Alware (A27), Sajjad Alam Iqbal Abdul Hakim Nazire (A61) and Tulsiram Dhondu Surve (A62).	Arguments of Petitioner

Hence, the Respondent ought to have been convicted for the charge of conspiracy.	Arguments of Petitioner
488.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Mushtaq Ahmad, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent has opposed the appeal contending that the learned Designated Court has already considered the matter and, following the parameters already laid down by this Court, reached the conclusion that the Respondent was not guilty of the first charge.	Arguments of Respondent
The facts of the case do not warrant interference by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
The Designated Court after appreciating the entire evidence on record, came to a conclusion as under Thus considering material in the confession of A42 and aforesaid coaccused the same leads to the conclusion of A42 also being involved in Shekadi landing operation as denoted by said material and as such having committed offence u s 3(3) of TADA for which he is charged at head	None
2nd	None
ly clause a.	None
Similarly the same evidence also establishes his involvement in commission of offences for which charge was framed at head 3rd ly and 4th ly on count of himself being in possession of contraband material unauthorisedly i.e. commission of offence under Arms Act and u s 6 of TADA for which he was charged with.	None
Similarly having regard to the fact that A14 has chosen him for keeping the 2 revolvers with him and himself having readily kept the same considered in proper perspective also reveals that role played by A42 was not restricted for Shekadi landing and transportation operation but he was a man of confidence of the prime accused involved in conspiracy and himself was also involved in conspiracy.	None
However, himself having committed relevant acts much prior to Serial Bomb blasts i.e. in the month of February 1993 and there being paucity of evidence to reveal his connection with the same in any manner, himself having not been to Bombay, nor participated in conspiratorial meeting, the acts committed by him were committed at the juncture when even the targets for Serial bomb blast were not fixed lead to the conclusion of himself being party to criminal conspiracy to commit terrorist act punishable u s 3(3) of TADA and himself being not party to the entire larger conspiracy for which the charge at head 1stly was framed against him.	None
The parameters laid down by this Court in entertaining the appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.	Reasoning
As the Respondent has been awarded sufficient punishment under different heads of Section 3(3) and 6 TADA, and the said offences themselves are a part of the conspiracy, and the learned Designated Court has divided the conspiracy into various components, considering the present case, where the accused were either involved in participating in various conspiratorial meetings, receiving training in the handling of arms, their active participation in the throwing of bombs or parking of vehicles fitted with explosives, or where the accused persons participated only in the landing and transportation of contraband, but were not aware of the contents of the said contraband, and further, another category where the accused had knowledge of the contents of the contraband, but did not participate either in the conspiratorial meetings held, or in any actual incident of any terrorist activity, and has awarded different punishments accordingly, we do not see any cogent reason to allow the said appeal.	None
The appeal is hence, dismissed.	Decision

Hence, this appeal.	Facts
Shri Sushil Karanjekar, learned Counsel appearing for the Appellants, has submitted that impugned judgment and order of conviction is not sustainable for the reason that recovery memo cannot be relied upon and the recovery had not been made in accordance with law.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned Special Judge erred in recording the findings that the Appellants had participated in the training for handling of arms at Sandheri on 8th January, 1993.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of the fact that the Appellants have not participated in acquiring any knowledge in handling of arms is meaningless and, therefore, their participation in the training cannot be relied upon.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of specific findings recorded by the learned Designated Court that the Appellants were not even known the contents of the contraband, their conviction under any provision of TADA is not sustainable.	Arguments of Petitioner

The said writings were read over to them by the police before their signatures.	None
After appreciating the entire evidence, the learned Designated Court recorded the finding that the Appellant (A79) could not furnish any explanation that he had no knowledge of said contraband material for some other reason, and his possession of such articles for such a long period considered along with his participation in the training programme leads to no other conclusion than himself being party to conspiracy to commit terrorist act.	None
However, having regard to fact that there exists no other evidence of commission of any act by the Appellant (A79) and there is no evidence of him having been to Bombay or having participated in conspiratorial meetings, it would be difficult to accept that knowledge of commission of serial bombs blasts in Bombay can be attributed to him.	None
Since there is a paucity of evidence to show that the Appellant (A79) had any knowledge regarding the places at which the explosions were committed in Bombay, he cannot be held liable for the offence of larger conspiracy for which the charge at head firstly is framed against him.	None
However, considering the acts and offences committed by him and particularly the retaining of such a contraband material and disposing the same definitely establishes himself being a party to conspiracy to commit terrorist act punishable u s 3(3) TADA.	None
The said material which was sent for chemical analysis particularly live handgrenades were defused, as deposed by Pramod Kisanrao Dhaware (PW598).	None
He also issued a certificate that 13 handgrenades had been defused which were given to Shri V.M. Ghadshi.	None
From the evidence referred to hereinabove, it is evident that Harishchandra Keshav Pawar (PW105) named three persons from his village participating in the arms training at Sandheri hillocks and one of them had been Issaq Mohmed Hajwani (A79).	None
Rajaram Ramchandra Kadam (PW106) named all the three Appellants to be members consisting of 810 persons participating in the training of arms and ammunition in Sandheri hillocks on 8.3.1993 and he identified all the three Appellants alongwith others in the court.	None
The other coaccused, particularly, Abdul Gani Ismail Turk (A11), Dawood Dawood Taklya Mohammed Phanse Phanasmiyan (A14) and Sharif Abdul Gafoor Parkar Dadabhai (A17), in their confessional statements had also named all the three Appellants as participants in the arms training on 8.3.1993 at Sandheri hillocks.	None
The evidence of the aforesaid persons is trustworthy as we do not see any reason to discard the same at least to the extent of participation of these three Appellants in arms training on 8.3.1993 at Sandheri hillocks.	None
In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed.	Decision
Criminal Appeal No. 396 of 2011 The Respondents (A106 A111) had been acquitted of the charge of conspiracy.	None
Hence, the State has filed appeal against them.	Issue
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant has submitted that the said Respondents had been very closely associated with terrorist activities and had participated in the training at Sandheri with Tiger Memon (AA).	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, they ought to have been convicted for the charge of conspiracy also.	Arguments of Petitioner
509.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the contrary, Shri Sushil Karanjekar, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents (A106 and A111) has vehemently opposed the appeal, contending that they were convicted and have served substantial part thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
The Respondents (A106 and A111) did not participate in the training at Sandheri, and at the most, they could be held to be silent spectators of the training and therefore, could not be involved in the offence.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
None of the said Respondents (A106 and A111) has made any confession.	None
The evidence against them regarding the training at Sandheri is only by Rajaram Kadam (PW106), who had deposed in the court that on 8.3.1993, some people were being trained in handling of arms at Chinchecha Mal in the morning at about 10 a.m.	None
As there was continuous firing he went to the said hillock in order to find out what was happening.	None
There he saw two persons armed with guns standing at the said place and 56 persons were sitting at Chinchecha Mal.	None
He also saw a cardboard target fixed nearby the hillock.	None
One person with the beard from the persons who were sitting there got up and asked him to leave the hillock otherwise he would be shot by the gun.	None
The witness (PW106) was frightened and immediately returned to his village.	None
He did not know the person who had threatened him or the other persons who were having the arms.	None
About 4 to 5 persons from his village were amongst the persons who were sitting at the said place at that time including these two Respondents (A106 and A111).	None
He identified both the Respondents (A106 and A111) in court as the persons sitting at Chinchecha Mal.	None
The learned Designated Court after appreciating the evidence came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to convict the Respondents (A106 and A111) u s 3(3) TADA, as they also facilitated Tiger Memon (AA) in other aspects, but merely sitting at the hillock, did not mean that they participated in the training and therefore, it could not be the basis of assuming that they were party to the training programme.	None
The parameters laid down by this Court in entertaining the appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.	Reasoning
In view of the above, we do not see any cogent reason to take the view contrary to the view taken by the learned Special Judge, considering the parameters laid down by this Court for entertaining the appeal against the order of acquittal.	Decision
The appeal lacks merit, and is accordingly, dismissed.	Decision
Criminal Appeal No. 414 of 2011 The Respondent (A79) had been acquitted of the charge of conspiracy.	None
Hence, the State has filed appeal against him.	Issue
Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant has submitted that there was enough evidence and particularly, the confessional statement made by Sharif Abdul Gafoor Parkar Dadabhai (A17), and the depositions of Mahadeo Jaswant Jadav (PW103), Ashok Vichare (PW104), Harish Chandra Pawar (PW105), Rajaram Kadam (PW106), and Namdev Pundlik Mahajan (PW587), to convict the Respondent for the first charge of conspiracy.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, the court below committed an error in acquitting the Respondent from the said charge, and thus on that count, the Respondent should be convicted.	Arguments of Petitioner
516.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ms. Farhana Shah, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent has submitted that considering the parameters for interference in an appeal against the order of acquittal, no interference is required.	Arguments of Respondent
The Respondent has already suffered sufficiently, and he has been convicted on various other charges.	Arguments of Respondent
Thus, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
The Designated Court after appreciating the entire evidence came to the following conclusion However, case regarding A79 clearly appears to be different.	None
There exists an evidence denoting that in consequent to information given by A79, 13 handgrenades and empties were recovered seized by police during the period from 1.4.1993 to 3.4.1993 from the sea coast at Gandharwadi.	None
The said facet considered on the backdrop that training programme had taken place on 8th of March, 1993 or thereabout leads to the conclusion of A79 having the knowledge of such a contraband article in the month of April 1993 and the same being recovered from the place shown by him.	None
Now considering in proper perspective the information furnished by A79 his knowledge of such material lying at the said place and the reason because of which he was having the same i.e. his authorship in dumping the material at the said place.	None
All the said evidence clearly reveals that all the said material must have been with A79 after the training programme was complete and or at least the said evidence and the ultimate act committed by him reveals that himself having dominum and control over the said material and hence consequently being in possession of same.	None
Thus having regard to the said facets leads to no other conclusion that A79 being also guilty for offence u s 6 of TADA, offences Under Sections 3 and 7 read with Section 25(1A)(1B)(a) of Arms Act and Section 201 Indian Penal Code.	None
In addition to same and having regard to fact that no explanation had come forward from A79 that he was having knowledge of said contraband material for some other reason and his possession of such articles for such a long period considered along with his participation in the training programme leads to no other conclusion than himself being party to conspiracy to commit terrorist act.	None
However, having regard to fact that there exists no other evidence of commission of any act by A79, himself being not a resident of Bombay, no evidence of himself having been to Bombay or having participated in conspiratorial meeting, it will be difficult to accept that knowledge of commission of serial bomb blasts in Bombay can be attributed to him.	None
Since there is a paucity of evidence to show that A79 was having any knowledge regarding the places at which the explosions were committed in Bombay he cannot be held liable for the offence of larger conspiracy for which charge at head firstly is framed against him.	None
However, considering the acts and offences committed by him and particularly the retaining of such a contraband material and disposing the same definitely establishes himself being party to conspiracy to commit terrorist act punishable u s 3(3) of TADA.	None
The court further held The same discloses that A79 was found guilty for commission of offence of conspiracy to commit terrorist act, punishable u s 3(3) of TADA and he was also found guilty on four other counts for commission of offences Under Sections 3(3) and 6 of TADA, Sections 3 7 read with Section 25(1A)(1B)(a) of Arms Act and Section 201 Indian Penal Code.	None
Without unnecessarily reiterating every aspect connected with decision arrived accordingly, in short it can be said that each of the said accused was found guilty accordingly mainly due to acts committed by him in connection with Sandheri training Episode which has taken place on 8th of March, 1993 at Borghat and Sandheri in which prime absconding accused Tiger Memon had organised a training camp for imparting a training of handling arms, ammunition and handgrenades to the persons taken from Bombay and so also local persons from the area of Sandheri.	None
The evidence surfaced and or reasoning given thereon earlier also reveals that all the aforesaid accused persons were local residents and were not from Bombay.	None
The same also does not disclose that they had any prior connection with Tiger Memon or any of the prime accused involved in this case, prior to their participation in training programme or even thereafter.	None
Similarly, the evidence does not disclose any of these accused having been trained in handling of handgrenades.	None
Though it is true that evidence have surfaced regarding Tiger Memon having imparted such a training of throwing of handgrenades at a place by name Manjeri Ghat, Waghjai etc.	None
still the same does not disclose that the same was imparted to any local person and on the contrary evidence discloses that the same was given to the persons, who were taken by Tiger Memon from Bombay to said place.	None
It is significant to note that though A79 has been held guilty accordingly still no evidence has surfaced on the record of A79 having used the handgrenades with him for the purposes of commission of any terrorist acts of committing explosion or any other acts to further the objective of conspiracy to which he was a party.	None
It is further significant to note that no evidence has surfaced on the record to reveal that A79 held guilty for offence of conspiracy or even A106 A111 at any point of time had been to Bombay for commission of any act furthering object of criminal conspiracy, to which A79 was found to be a party.	None
Needless to add that acts committed by each of the accused were confined to Sandheri and the same had never transcended beyond the said area and none of them and particularly A79 is not found to have committed any act in the area of Bombay i.e. the place at which serial blasts were committed, resulting into deaths of and or injuries to many.	None
Having regard to all the aforesaid facets and particularly taking into consideration the extent of acts committed by A79 he was found guilty for offence of conspiracy to the extent i.e. only for offence of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts made punishable u s 3(3) of TADA or in other words A79 was not found guilty for a party to a conspiracy for the acts for which the charge at head firstly was framed against him.	None
Since elaborate reasoning for coming to such a conclusion, being already recorded in the earlier part of the judgment and so also the aspect of framing such elaborate charge, etc. being also recorded explained during the said earlier part of reasoning and so also while making a common discussion the earlier part of the sentence part of judgment and so also while discussing about awarding sentence to accused, who had acquired the training at Pakistan i.e. A77, 92, 94, 95, 108, 115, it will be wholly unnecessary for once again repeat the said reasoning.	None
As stated earlier prosecution has demanded for giving maximum penalty prescribed under the law for all the aforesaid accused who according to prosecution i.e. A106 to A111 falling in second group while A79 falling in the first group made by learned Chief Public Prosecutor i.e. the group of accused found guilty for commission of offences under TADA and so also under other enactments.	None
During the discussion made earlier for reasons already given it has been already ruled that such a blanket attitude cannot be taken while determining the sentence for such accused placed in said group as different penalty ranging from 5 years to life imprisonment with fine has been prescribed under TADA for commission of various acts offences as prescribed u s 3(3) of TADA including for offence of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts made punishable under the same.	None
The parameters laid down by this Court in entertaining the appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.	Reasoning
In view of the fact that after appreciating the entire evidence the learned Special Judge reached the conclusion that the case of Respondent (A79) was entirely different from the other coaccused, particularly those who had not participated in the training of arms.	None
It was further held that Respondent (A79) had knowledge of the said contraband material being arms and ammunition and had been brought for terrorist activities and he was found in possession of the handgrenades and empties it was further found that A79 had thrown the same in the creek water to absolve himself of the offences.	None
We are of the view that the Special Judge was not justified in acquitting him from the first charge of larger conspiracy merely on the ground that he did not know about the places where the bombs had to be thrown and he was not the resident of Bombay and did not participate in the conspiratorial meetings.	None
The finding of fact recorded by the Special Judge is also contradictory as the court held that he participated in the arms training at Sandheri.	None
However, he observed that the evidence does not disclose that any of those accused had been trained in handling of handgrenades.	None
In view of the fact that there is sufficient material on record that the Respondent participated in the training of handling the handgrenades, there was no occasion for the learned Special Judge to take such a view.	None
In view of the above, the appeal stands allowed.	Decision
The Respondent is awarded life imprisonment.	Decision
The Respondent is directed to surrender before the learned Designated Court within a period of four weeks to serve out the remaining sentence, failing which the Designated Court will secure his custody and send him to jail to serve out the sentence.	Decision
Criminal appeal No. 1423 of 2007 This appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 31.5.2007 passed by the Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA in the Bombay Blast cases, Greater Bombay in Bombay Blast Case	Issue

In addition to the main charge of conspiracy, the Appellant was charged for participating in and assisting Mushtaq Ibrahim Tiger Abdul Razak Memon, and his associates in the landing and transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives which were smuggled into India for the purpose of committing terrorist acts, at various points such as, Shekhadi, Taluka Shrivardhan, District Raigad on 3rd and 7th February, 1993, and further for agreeing to undergo weapons training in Pakistan in the handling of arms, ammunition and explosives for committing the said terrorist acts and for this purpose, he travelled to Dubai, and attended conspiratorial meetings held there in these regards.	Facts
Shri Mushtaq Ahmad, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant (A128), has submitted that he was only 21 years of age at the time of the aforementioned incident, and that he had falsely been implicated in the case, as he was not involved in any overt act, nor he had gone to Pakistan for any weapons training.	Arguments of Petitioner
A128 was arrested at Bhusawal, and his conviction cannot stand for want of evidence against him.	Arguments of Petitioner
Some of the coaccused in their confessional statements, named merely Shahnawaz and in addition to the Appellant, there is also another convict named Shahnawaz Qureshi.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, there has been confusion regarding the identification of the Appellant (A128).	Arguments of Petitioner
Hence, this appeal deserves to be allowed.	Arguments of Petitioner
524.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the contrary, Shri Mukul Gupta, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent, has vehemently opposed the appeal contending that the confessional statement of the Appellant (A128) has been corroborated by the confessional statements of various other coaccused, particularly, Dawood Taklya Mohammed Phanse (A14), Munna Mohammed Ali Khan Manojkumar Bhavarlal Gupta (A24), Ashfaq Kasim Havaldar (A38), Shaikh Mohmed Ethesham Haji Gulam Rasool Shaikh (A58), Nasir Abdul Kader Kewal Nasir Dakhla (A64), Shaikh Kasam Babulal Ismail Shaikh (A109) and Salim Kutta (A134).

None
He had hence been falsely implicated in the said case.	None
In his statement u s 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, while replying to Question Nos. 218 and 292, he denied his participation in the Shekhadi landing of weapons and in the transportation of the same to Bombay.	None
He also denied that he had gone to Dubai to execute a certain conspiracy and in fact, rather suggested that he had gone there on a business trip.	None
Upon consideration of the entire evidence on record, the Designated Court held that the same leads to the inescapable conclusion of the Appellant (A128) being involved in the Shekhadi landing operation as has been denoted by the said material and has thus committed an offence u s 3(3) TADA.	None
It was further held that considering the evidence of the said landing, and the role carried out by the Appellant (A128) and ultimately the fact that he himself had continued with the said operation, and had not provided any information about the same to any proper authority, the defences contention that earlier he did not know the purpose for which he was going to Shekhadi, or that he was not aware that the arms and ammunition were to be smuggled, is liable to be rejected.	None
The confession of the Appellant (A128) itself reveals, that during the course of said operation he became fully aware of the nature of the contraband goods i.e., the same being arms and ammunition.	None
The Appellant (A128) being taken to Bombay for the execution of the said operation, and thereafter being sent to Dubai for training denotes that he was a man in whom Tiger Memon (AA) had confidence, as he did in the other conspirators.	None
However since the Appellant (A128) committed the aforementioned relevant acts much before the main conspiracy of actually committing the bomb blasts planned and had not participated in any meetings or committed any acts in furtherance of the said main conspiracy, it was held that he could not be held guilty for the offence of larger conspiracy i.e. first charge, but is required to be held guilty for the conspiracy to commit terrorist acts as aforementioned.

The said appeal lacks merit and is thus, accordingly dismissed.	Decision

Shri Mushtaq Ahmad, learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent has submitted that the Designated Court has considered the entire evidence, and after appreciating the same, it came to the conclusion that the Respondent was not guilty of the first charge of conspiracy.	Arguments of Respondent
In view of the parameters laid down by this Court, no interference is required against the order of acquittal.	Arguments of Respondent
Hence, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
After appreciating the entire evidence, the Designated Court came to the conclusion that the Respondent (A128) had participated in landing and transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives.	None
It was also concluded that he (A128) had agreed to undergo weapons training in Pakistan for committing terrorist acts.	None
He also attended a meeting at Dubai alongwith coconspirators to plan commission of terrorist acts.	None
Thus, the Respondent (A128) was found guilty of conspiracy only to the extent of commission of terrorist acts punishable u s 3(3) TADA, and not of the larger conspiracy as he could not go to Pakistan for training for handling of arms and ammunition.	None
He (A128) had been acquitted of the charge of larger conspiracy for the reason that he did not participate in any act after his return from Dubai on 1.3.1993.	None
