In the instant case, the respondentapplicant being dissatisfied with the award of compensation determined by the competent authority under subsection(1) of Section 3G of the Act, 1956 filed application for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of Section 3G(5) to the Central Government on 8 th December, 2006.	Facts
As alleged, since the Central Government has not responded to his request for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of letter dated 8 th December, 2006 within a period of 30 days from receipt of the request, application was filed on 7 th March, 2007 to the Chief Justice his designate for appointment of an Arbitrator invoking Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996.	Facts
It reveals that the Arbitrator was appointed by the Central Government sometime in April 2007.	Facts
The High Court of Calcutta taking note of the fact that the Arbitrator has been appointed by the Central Government under Section 3G(5) of the Act, 1956 after the respondentapplicant had moved an application to the Chief Justice his Designate invoking its power under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 held that right of appointment of the Arbitrator by the Central Government stands forfeited as it failed to appoint the Arbitrator until filing of the application under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 before the High Court of Calcutta and appointment of Arbitrator during the pendency of proceedings, cannot be said to be a valid appointment and hence referred the matter to be placed before the Chief Justice for naming an Arbitrator vide its Order dated 6 th July, 2007.	Facts
Immediately after passing of the order dated 6 th July, 2007, the appellant moved an application for review and it was brought to the notice of the High Court that the Act, 1956 being a special enactment laying down a procedure for appointment of an Arbitrator where the power is being exclusively vested with the Central Government under Section 3G(5) of the Act, 1956, the application made under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 is not maintainable but this was not considered to be a valid reason for invoking review jurisdiction by the High Court as envisaged under Order 47 Rule 1 read with Section 114 of Code of Civil Procedure and the review application was dismissed vide Order dated August 27, 2007.	Facts
It may be relevant to note that the sole Arbitrator (Justice P.N. Sinha) who was appointed by the High Court of Calcutta pursuant to Order dated 6 th July, 2007 under Section 11 of the Act, 1996 before initiation of the proceedings, sent the letter of his recusal dated 25 th January, 2008 (Annexure P12).	Facts
It is informed to this Court that the Arbitrator who was appointed by the Central Government under Section 3G(5) of the Act, 1956 in April, 2007 could not have proceeded after the intervention was made by the High Court of Calcutta in appointing the sole Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996.	Facts
That for all practical purposes, the dispute raised by the respondentapplicant aggrieved by the compensation awarded under subsections(1) or (2) of Section 3G of the Act, 1956 has so far not been adjudicated because of the competence of the authority in appointing the Arbitrator remain pending decision as to whether it would be under the Act, 1956 or Act, 1996 as invoked by the High Court of Calcutta under the order impugned before us.	Facts
10.	None
Mr. Vikas Goel, learned counsel for the appellant submits that the Act 1956 being a special enactment is a code in itself provide not only the procedure of acquisition but also the mode of determining compensation by the competent authority and any person, if aggrieved by the compensation determined under sub sections(1) or (2) of Section 3G of Act 1956 can certainly move an application for appointment of an Arbitrator to which a Central Government is under obligation to appoint under Section 3G(5) of the Act 1956.	Arguments of Petitioner
But before the matter could be proceeded, the respondentapplicant approached the High Court by filing an application under Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 which was not maintainable and this being the settled principles of law that the special law prevail over the general law, the provisions of Act 1996 could not have been invoked at least for the appointment of an Arbitrator in abrogating the power of the Central Government in appointing the Arbitrator as contemplated under Section 3G(5) of Act 1956 and this being an apparent error in law committed by the High Court needs to be interfered by this Court.

In support of his submission, learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the recent judgment of two Judges Bench of this Court in General Manager (Project), National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Prakash Chand Pradhan Ors. passed in Civil Appeal No. 5250 of 2018 decided on 16 th May, 2018 and taking assistance thereof submits that the order passed by the High Court of Calcutta in the appointment of an Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of Act 1996 is not legally sustainable and both the Orders passed by the High Court, i.e. 6 th July, 2007 and 27 th August, 2007 deserves to be quashed and set aside.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra, Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel for the respondents, while supporting the order passed by the High Court of Calcutta impugned in the instant proceedings submits that subsection(6) of Section 3G clearly postulates that subject to the provisions of the Act 1956, the provisions of Act 1996 shall apply to every arbitration under the Act, 1956.	Arguments of Respondent
If the authority to whom application was filed for appointment of an Arbitrator under Section 3G(5) of Act, 1956 has failed to discharge its obligations within 30 days of presentation of the application which indisputedly was December, 2006 or until filing of the application for appointment of an Arbitrator to the Chief Justice his Designate under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 i.e. 7 th March, 2007, the respondent was justified in taking recourse to subsection(6) of Section 3G of Act, 1956 for appointment of an Arbitrator under Section 11(6) of Act, 1996.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel further submits that the appellant under the Act, 1956 has forfeited its right to appoint an Arbitrator after presentation of the application under the Act, 1996 before the High Court of Calcutta and in the given circumstances, there was no legal impediment before the High Court of Calcutta in appointment of an Arbitrator invoking Section 11(6) of Act 1996 and in support of his submission placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in Deep Trading Company Vs. Indian Oil Corporation and Others 2013(4) SCC 35.	Arguments of Respondent
We have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their assistance perused the material available on record.	None
At the very outset, we may notice that the two Judge Bench of this Court in the recent judgment in General Manager (Project), National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. case(supra), while dealing with the scope of subsections (5) and (6) of Section 3G of the Act 1956 with reference to Section 11 of the Act, 1996 has held that the Act 1956 being a special enactment and Section 3G in particular provides an inbuilt mechanism for appointment of an Arbitrator by the Central Government.	Reasoning
Hence Section 11 of the Act, 1996 has no application and the power is exclusively vested with the Central Government under Section 3G(5) of the Act, 1956 for appointment of an Arbitrator and if the Central Government does not appoint an Arbitrator within a reasonable time, it is open for the party to avail the remedy either by filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or a suit for the purpose but the remedy of Section 11 of Act 1996 is not available for appointment of an Arbitrator.	Reasoning
We are in full agreement with the legal position stated by a two Judge Bench of this Court in General Manager (Project), National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. case(supra) but like to add further that the Act, 1956 has been enacted under Entry 23 of the Union List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution with the exclusive power to legislate with respect to highways, which are declared to be national highways by or under law by the Parliament.	Reasoning
It is a comprehensive code and a special enactment which provides an inbuilt mechanism not only in initiating acquisition until culmination of the proceedings in determining the compensation and its adjudication by the Arbitrator to be appointed by the Central Government and if still remain dissatisfied, by the Court of law.	Reasoning
In compliance of the mandate of Sections 3A to 3F of the Act, 1956, after the land is acquired, there shall be paid an amount of compensation which shall be determined by an order of the competent authority under subsections (1) or (2) of Section 3G of the Act, 1956 and any person who is aggrieved by the amount so determined by the competent authority or what being determined is not acceptable to either of the parties, on an application being filed by either of the parties, has to be determined by the Arbitrator to be appointed by the Central Government in terms of subsection (5) of Section 3G of the Act, 1956.	None
After analysing the scheme, it can be assumed that the legislature intended the Act, 1956 to act as a complete code in itself for the purpose of acquisition until culmination including disbursement and for settlement of disputes and this conclusion is further strengthened in view of Section 3J of the Act which eliminates the application of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, to an acquisition under the Act, 1956.	Reasoning
It is settled principles of law that when the special law sets out a selfcontained code, the application of general law would impliedly be excluded.	Reasoning
In the instant case, the scheme of Act, 1956 being a special law enacted for the purpose and for appointment of an arbitrator by the Central Government under Section 3G(5) of Act, 1956 and subsection (6) of Section 3G itself clarifies that subject to the provisions of the Act 1956, the provisions of Act 1996 shall apply to every arbitration obviously to the extent where the Act 1956 is silent, the Arbitrator may take recourse in adjudicating the dispute invoking the provisions of Act, 1996 for the limited purpose.	Reasoning
But so far as the appointment of an Arbitrator is concerned, the power being exclusively vested with the Central Government as envisaged under subsection (5) of Section 3G of Act 1956, Section 11 of the Act 1996 has no application.	Reasoning
The plea of the respondents that they have rightly taken recourse in the facts and circumstances of Section 11 of the Act, 1996 cannot be accepted for the reason that Section 3G(6) of the Act, 1956 clearly stipulates that the provisions of the Act, 1996 will apply subject to the provisions of the Act, 1956.	Reasoning
The usage of the expression subject to clearly indicates that the legislature intended to give overriding effect to the provisions of the Act, 1956 where it relates to the disputes pertaining to determination of the amount of compensation under the Act.	Reasoning
The irresistible conclusion is that the legislature in its wisdom intended to abrogate the power for appointment of an Arbitrator under the provisions of the Act, 1996.	Reasoning
In our considered view, the High Court of Calcutta was not holding its competence to appoint an Arbitrator invoking Section 11 of Act, 1996.	Reasoning
This very question earlier arose before this Court whether the application under Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 is maintainable in view of statutory provisions of Electricity Act, 2003 adjudicating the dispute between the licencees and the generating companies of the special enactment and Section 86(1) of the Electricity Act, 2003 in particular, this Court in	None
Gujarat Urja Vikash Nigam Ltd.	None
Vs.	Arguments of Petitioner
Essar Power Limited 2008(4) SCC 755 in para 28 observed as under Section 86(1)(f) is a special provision and hence will override the general provision in Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for arbitration of disputes between the licensee and generating companies.	None
It is well settled that the special law overrides the general law.	None
Hence, in our opinion, Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has no application to the question who can adjudicate arbitrate disputes between licensees and generating companies, and only Section 86(1)(f) shall apply in such a situation.	None
We are also of the considered opinion that in view of the power being vested exclusively with the Central Government to appoint an Arbitrator under Section 3G(5) of the Act 1956, being a special enactment, the application filed under Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 for appointment of an Arbitrator was not maintainable and provisions of the Act, 1996 could not be invoked for the purpose.	Reasoning
The submission of learned counsel for the respondents that as the appellant failed to make an appointment of the Arbitrator pursuant to a letter dated 8 th December, 2006 in terms of Section 3G(5) of the Act, 1956 within a period of 30 days, the High Court of Calcutta alone was holding its competence to appoint an Arbitrator and application was submitted by the respondent applicant on 7 th March, 2007 the right of appointment of an Arbitrator by the Central Government stands forfeited and has relied on the Judgment of this Court in Deep Trading Company case(supra) is of without substance for the reason that there is no statutory limitation provided under subsection (5) of Section 3G of Act 1956 for the Central Government to appoint an Arbitrator but that may not give an unguided discretion to the authority and in the absence of any statutory limitation, it must be within the reasonable time and if the Central Government fails in discharge of its statutory duty in appointing an Arbitrator on a request being made by either of the party aggrieved, it will be open to the party to invoke either the writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or the Civil Court for the purpose.	Reasoning
But as long as the power is exclusively vested with the Central Government for appointment of an Arbitrator under Section 3G(5) of the Act 1956, the provision of Section 11 of Act 1996 has no application.	Reasoning
The judgment in Deep Trading Company case(supra) on which learned counsel has placed reliance is of no assistance for the reason firstly that controversy there was not in reference to the appointment of an Arbitrator under the special enactment as in the instant case under Act 1956 and secondly, if one party fails to exercise its power of appointment in terms of Clause 29 of the agreement in vogue, the provisions of Act 1996 would apply and the question for consideration was whether the rights of the party stand forfeited to appoint an Arbitrator after the party has invoked Section 11(6) of the Act 1996 which, as already observed by us, is not the question for consideration in the instant case.	Reasoning
It is indeed true that the Arbitrator who was appointed by the Central Government subsequent to the filing of an application under Section 11 of the Act 1996 in April, 2007 could not proceed after the Arbitrator was appointed pursuant to the Order impugned in the instant proceedings, who too has later recused and almost 12 years have rolled by now, we deem it appropriate to observe that there is no need to file any application by the respondentapplicant and the Central Government shall consider and appoint an Arbitrator in terms of Section 3G(5) of the Act 1956 within a period of 30 days with prior intimation to the respondents.	Decision
As the litigation has consumed a sufficient long time, we consider it appropriate to further observe that the Arbitrator so appointed by the Central Government may adjudicate and decide the dispute within a reasonable time but in no case later than six months after the respondentapplicant record its presence in the proceedings.	Decision
The appeals accordingly succeed and are allowed.	Decision
The orders passed by the High Court dated 6 th July, 2007 and 27 th August, 2007 are hereby set aside.	Decision
The Arbitrator may be appointed by the appellants in terms indicated above.	Decision
No costs.	None
Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.	Decision
