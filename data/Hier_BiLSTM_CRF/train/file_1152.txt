It is pointed out by the prosecution that this factor was considered and rejected by the Designated Court in Para 48, Part 30 wherein it was held that In the same context, the further defence submission that A8 was at Dubai since August, 1992 and as such she cannot be held liable for such a user of the van also does not appeal to the mind.	Arguments of Respondent
A fact cannot be lost sight of that the said movable property was standing in the name of A8.	Arguments of Respondent
Even accepting that A 8 was then at Dubai, still the possession of the said van will be required to be with her.	Arguments of Respondent
In view of the same, if the said van was used for such nefarious activities then the same would lead to a logical conclusion of such a user could not have been made without her permission of her connivance.	Arguments of Respondent

Reasoning

Appeal by the State of Maharashtra through CBI Criminal Appeal No. 419 of 2011 The abovesaid appeal has been filed by the State against acquittal of A2, A6, A7 and A8 of the charges framed against them.	None
Except A8, the CBI has not pressed the same against A2, A6 and A7 before this Court, who was acquitted of (i) a part of charge stated in clause (a) at head secondly framed against her and (ii) charge stated in clause (b).	Issue
After careful examination of all the materials placed, we are of the view that in the absence of any positive evidence, A8 cannot be convicted for the acts done and mentioned hereinabove (part of charge mentioned at head secondly) and the Designated Court has rightly acquitted her for the same.	Decision
In the light of the above, the appeal of the State is liable to be dismissed.	Decision
Sentence The Designated Court has awarded rigorous imprisonment for life to each of the appellants for commission of offences under section 3(3) of TADA and under Section 120B of IPC.	Issue
The prosecution submitted that the appellants were given full opportunity to defend themselves on the question of quantum of sentence.	Arguments of Respondent
Essa Anjum Abdul Razak Memon (A3) A3 filed a statement dated 14.09.2006 on the quantum of sentence, which is Exhibit 2942.	None

Student in the year 1993 and the flat was purchased by his father (deceased) and he was only staying in it and was not the owner of the same He has been in custody for 12 years and He had serious medical ailments including brain tumor and diabetes.	None
Yusuf Abdul Razak Memon (A4) A4 filed a statement dated 15.09.2006 on the quantum of sentence which is Exhibit 2944.	None
A4, inter alia, stated that (i) He is suffering from chronic schizophrenia The Flat at AlHussaini was purchased by his father jointly with him since his father was managing his savings and He has no criminal background.	None
Rubina Suleman Memon (A8) A8 filed a statement dated 14.09.2006 on the quantum of sentence which is Exhibit 2943.	None
A8, inter alia, stated that (i) The vehicle bearing No. MFC 1972 was purchased by her fatherinlaw and she was unaware about what had happened to the vehicle after she left for Dubai to be with her husband in August 1992 (ii) She was not in India during August 1992 August 1994 and (iii)	None
She has two children.	None
The Designated Court has considered all the abovesaid factors in respect of the appellants.	Reasoning
The evidence on record establishes that the A8 was aware that the vehicle owned by her (i.e. MFC 1972) was being used for terrorist acts by Tiger Memon and his associates.	Reasoning
It is further established that Flat Nos. 22, 25 and 26 at AlHussaini building, where members of the Memons family resided jointly, were the nucleus of the criminal conspiracy as they were the locations where Tiger Memon and Yakub Memon met with several other coaccused persons during the period of the conspiracy.	Reasoning
Further, the arms and explosives smuggled into India for the purpose of the conspiracy were also kept at the said building and lastly RDX was filled in the vehicles in and outside the garages allocated to the Memons at Al Hussaini building which were used planted as bombs at various places on 12.03.1993 by all the conspirators.	Reasoning
Further, it is pertinent to note here that the evidence on record reveals that the Maruti car used by A3 was (a) driven by several coaccused persons including A15, A46 and A11 to the landing point at Shekhadi from Bombay for landing of weapons in February, 1993 (b) loaded with RDX on the night of 11.03.1993 at AlHussaini Building and (c) parked on 12.03.1993 at the Lucky Petrol Pump by A16 and PW2 near Shiv Sena Bhawan which exploded killing 4 persons and injuring 38 others.	Reasoning
The above mentioned evidence establishes that the white car driven by A3 was used for terrorist activities by Tiger Memon and other coaccused persons.	Reasoning
Further, A3, A4, and A8 resided jointly at these flats where Tiger Memon, Yakub Memon (A1) and their associates hatched the criminal conspiracy to carry out multiple explosions in Bombay.	Reasoning
The conduct of the appellants in not reporting any of these activities to the police and the fact that A3 and A4 departed from India on 11.03.1993 in itself is an incriminating circumstance to be used against the appellants.	Reasoning
None of the appellants responded to the proclamation requiring presence issued by the Designated Court, which was given wide publicity.	Reasoning
The evidence on record establishes that the appellants facilitated the commission of terrorist acts as defined in Section 3(1) of TADA by conniving with Tiger Memon and his associates and permitting them to use their flats and vehicles for the purposes of criminal conspiracy.	Reasoning
The actions of the appellants squarely fall within Section 3(3) of TADA insofar as the appellants have facilitated and abetted the conduct of terrorist acts by Tiger Memon and his associates.	Reasoning
After the blasts that took place in Bombay on 12.03.1993, the Memons were living together in Dubai.	None
They never disclosed the connection of Tiger with the blasts to anyone.	None
Their conduct of living together after fleeing from Bombay and not informing about these blasts to any of the concerned authorities at Indian Embassy establishes that they were also involved in the conspiracy to commit the bomb blasts.	None
After the blasts, the Memons fled to Pakistan from Dubai and there is evidence that in Pakistan they had obtained Pakistani Passports and National Identity Cards in assumed names.	Reasoning
The Memons and their family members were leading a comfortable and luxurious life after the blasts.	Reasoning
They had acquired properties, started business in the name and style of M s Home Land Builders, acquired fictitious qualification certificates, driving licences, etc, all of which established that they had chosen a comfortable life in Pakistan and were determined not to return to India in their original identity.	Reasoning
The abovesaid facts clearly establish that the members of Memons family were connected with the Bombay Bomb Blasts.	Reasoning
All the members of Memons family were declared Proclaimed Offenders by the Designated Court, Bombay.	Reasoning
The rewards were also declared in Indian as well as in foreign currency for their arrest.	Reasoning
Despite that, they did not surrender.	Reasoning
Instead, the Memons travelled to Bangkok and Singapore from Karachi for holiday in assumed names on Pakistani Passports during April, 1993.	Reasoning
They have not taken any steps to surrender before Indian Authorities or Thailand Authorities on their arrival to Bangkok and Singapore after having come to know about the blasts engineered by Tiger Memon nor made any attempt to return to India openly if they had felt that bomb blasts are offences committed in India.	Reasoning
This conduct clearly establishes that they were aware of the blasts that were engineered by Tiger Memon who was living with them right from the time of blasts, i.e., 12th March 1993, in Dubai, Pakistan and other places.	Reasoning
Their documents for travel to Bangkok and Singapore from Karachi show that they have travelled on Pakistani Passports using fake names.	Reasoning
This conduct also establishes their culpability.	Reasoning
It is also in evidence that huge amount of jewellery and cash which was abandoned by the members of Memons family was recovered from the AlHussaini building when they hurriedly left Bombay just before the blasts.	Reasoning
This is also a proof that all the Memons were fully aware of the blasts and their conduct in fleeing away very clearly establishes that they were aware of the blasts and association of Tiger Memon with the blasts.	Reasoning
In view of the materials placed on record by the prosecution and the ultimate analysis of the Designated Court, we fully agree with the conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellants, consequently, the appeals filed by the appellants are liable to be dismissed.	Reasoning

While considering the common charge, namely, conspiracy, the Designated Court has recorded a finding that there is no evidence on record to establish that the recovered contraband was smuggled by Tiger Memon and his associates.	None
The Court also recorded that the evidence brought in has failed to establish precisely the period for which A71 was in possession of the said contraband material and further, there is nothing on record to suggest for what purpose the appellant was in possession of such a huge quantity of contraband.	None
It is relevant to point out that at the trial, the appellantaccused along with A103, in addition to the principal charge of conspiracy framed at head firstly was further charged at head secondly for commission of offence under Section 3(3) of TADA on account of A71, in pursuance of the conspiracy, during the period, i.e., January, 1993 to April, 1993 having agreed to keep in his possession 85 hand grenades, 350 electronic detonators, 3270 live cartridges of AK56 rifles unauthorisedly, which were part of consignment smuggled by coconspirators Tiger Memon and his associates for commission of terrorist acts.	Facts
Regarding the discovery of arms and ammunitions in large quantities, the Designated Judge has noted that though one of the panch witness had not supported the prosecution case, however, the Designated Court has held that the evidence of the officer from BDDS cannot be termed to be an interested witness as the said investigation was not affected at his behest.	None
Considering all the relevant materials pertaining to the statement made by the accused and discovery seizure effected in pursuance of the same and the said evidence being duly corroborated by contemporaneous document i.e. Panchnama referred to hereinabove and other evidence establishing the nature of contraband articles, the same will lead to the conclusion that A 71 was in possession of such article which he had kept in the unused lavatory.	None
As rightly concluded by the Designated Judge, all the said evidence, in clear terms, reveal that A71 was in possession of huge quantity of contraband material within the notified area of Greater Bombay attracting the provisions of Section 5 of TADA and failing to rebut the presumption arising out of such unlawful possession.	None
The said presumption has been explained by a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Sanjay Dutt vs. State thr.	None
CBI, Bombay, (1994) 5 SCC 410 as the presumption of having himself possessed the same for commission of terrorist activity.	None
In view of the same, the Designated Judge has rightly held A71 guilty of commission of offence under Section 5 of TADA.	None
Considering the large quantity of contraband materials in the possession of A71, the period in which he was found to be in possession of the same and all the other relevant circumstances, it lead to the conclusion that A71 himself being possessed the same and in the said process having contravened the provisions of the Arms Act, 1959, the Explosives Act, 1884 etc. thereby having made himself liable for commission of offences under Section 6 of TADA and also under Sections 3 and 7 read with Section 25 (1A) and (1B) (a) of the Arms Act, 1959.	None
Upon a conjoint reading of the entire evidence, it is clearly established that the appellant was fully conscious and aware of the ultimate use of the smuggled arms and ammunitions and explosives.	None
Thus, the charges framed at head thirdly and fourthly against the accused stood established.	None
Appeal by the State of Maharashtra through CBI Criminal Appeal No. 413 of 2011 We have already extracted the common charge of conspiracy in the earlier part of our order.	None
The Designated Court, on going through the confessional statement of the appellant and coaccused persons, viz., A10 and A12 disbelieved their version and rejected the same.	Issue
Though Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the CBI pointed out certain materials regarding the charge framed at head firstly, i.e., conspiracy, we are satisfied that the prosecution failed to establish the relevant materials, viz., contraband, being part of the material smuggled into India by Tiger Memon and Dawood Ibrahim for commission of terrorist act or the same being given to A71 by Tiger Memon or any other coconspirator and in the absence of further acceptable material in order to prove the nexus of A71 with the conspiracy for which the charge was framed at head firstly, A71 cannot be held liable for commission of the said offence.	None
We agree with the conclusion arrived at by the Designated Court and the appeal of the State is liable to be dismissed.	None

After considering the acts committed and the statement regarding the quantum of sentence, it was held On the aforesaid backdrop considering submission advanced by Ld. advocate Mr. HH Ponda for A71 that considering character of evidence about guilt of accused i.e. the same being based upon the Disclosure Statement leading to recovery of huge contraband articles from a lavatory at a public place or quantity of material recovered denoting that the same were with A71 merely for storage purpose and hence considering his age being of 65 years or he is a sick person minimum sentence as provided under law would be warranted does not appeal to mind after taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances relating to the offences for which A71 has been found guilty.	Facts
Such a conclusion is inevitable as a fact cannot be overlooked that A71 was possessing such contraband material capable of causing mass destruction within the notified area.	Facts
It needs no saying that the weapon of such a nature cannot be acquired and or possessed without incurring any appreciable expenditure.	Facts
Truly speaking possession of such a large quantity of contraband material with A71 viewed from any angle i.e. either himself having acquired the same or somebody else having kept with him and taking into consideration the purpose for which the same can be said to have been possessed i.e. illegal use of same for illegal purpose would warrant levying the maximum punishment prescribed under law.	Facts
Thus after taking into consideration the gravity of acts committed by A71, nature of material possessed by him but the same being not recovered from his house and the same being recovered from a unused lavatory in Musafirkhana but concealed at the said place, A71 being not found involved in terrorist act and considering matters disclosed from clauses No. 1 to 12 in answer to relevant question asked to him while recording his statement upon quantum of sentence to be imposed i.e. at Exh.3000 i.e. his age, the ailments suffered by him, himself being not fully recovered, himself having faced legal proceedings for 13 years, himself having no antecedents, himself having not involved in any terrorist act, court having not received any adverse report about his conduct etc., during long drawn trial and having regard to sentence given to Al07, 72 and few others having regard to quantity of contraband material possessed by them and the material possessed by A71 sentence of RI for Life and a fine of Rs. l lakh with a suitable sentence of further RI in event of nonpayment of fine for commission of offence u s.5 of TADA and sentence of RI for life and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh with a suitable sentence of further RI in event of nonpayment of fine for commission of offence u s. 6 of TADA with no separate sentence for the reasons stated earlier for commission of offence under Sec. 3 and 7 r w Sec. 25 (1A) (1B)(a) of Arms Act for A71 would serve the ends of justice.	Facts
Needless to add that contraband material seized will require to be confiscated.	None
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that under the facts and circumstances of the case, the Designated Court while sentencing the appellant erred in not striking a balance between doctrine of proportionality and doctrine of rehabilitation and according to him, the appellant was granted maximum punishment prescribed under Sections 5 and 6 of TADA whereas minimum punishment prescribed is 5 years.	Arguments of Petitioner
He further submitted that considering his age, ailment and conduct the appellant did not deserve the maximum punishment.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also pointed out that the appellant had already undergone a period of 8 (eight and a half) years approximately without remission.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is relevant to note that even according to the prosecution, all the above mentioned goods though being smuggled, kept only in the open lavatory within the Musafirkhana.	None
In other words, admittedly, the recovery was from an open and accessible place to all the persons visiting the Musafirkhana for any purpose including prayer or the persons staying therein.	None
It is also relevant to point out that the prosecution failed to lead acceptable evidence to show that such recovered contrabands were used in any crime by the appellant and even the Designated Court came to the same finding.	None
As per the proved charges under Sections 5 and 6 of TADA, the minimum punishment prescribed is 5 years and maximum is life sentence.	None
Taking note of the age, ailments and conduct of the appellant as recorded by the Designated Court itself in Part 46 of the impugned judgment noted down while confirming the conviction, we feel that the appellant did not deserve the maximum sentence of life imprisonment.	None
At the time of arguments, learned counsel for the appellant pointed out that as on date, the appellant is more than 70 years of age and is suffering from a number of ailments.	Arguments of Petitioner
About his medical condition and ailments, learned counsel has furnished all the details in Crl.	Arguments of Petitioner
MP No. 52255226 of 2011 wherein it has been stated that the appellant is on liquid diet, he has no criminal antecedent and there is no adverse report with respect to him during the trial.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also pointed out that the appellant has already undergone a period of 8 years (approximately) without remission.	Arguments of Petitioner
Taking note of all these aspects, we feel that while confirming the conviction, ends of justice would be met by reducing the sentence of the appellant to RI for 10 years.	None
Consequently, we dispose of the appeals filed by the appellant (A71) while confirming the conviction and reduce the sentence to RI for 10 years.	Decision
The appeal filed by the State in respect of acquittal ordered by the Designated Court relating to the common charge of conspiracy is also dismissed.	None

Dosa took place before the conspiracy started.	None
In an answer, the counsel for the CBI submitted that although ex facie it appears that the case against A112 is of dereliction of duty and negligence, a closer scrutiny of the entire evidence on record would show that the appellant had a connection and understanding with the smugglers in order to facilitate a safe passage to them.

This aspect has been elaborately dealt with in the appeal of A1.	None
In view of our conclusion therein, there is no need to discuss the same once again.	None

None
It is also clear that the above fact shows that A112 was aware of even minute details of travel of Tiger Memon with contraband.	None
It is further submitted that it is also clear that A112 also did not pay any heed to the suggestion of PW99 who was a senior Inspector and suggested a better place for watch.	None

A112 told him that he had specific information about the landing of contraband silver on a particular route at a particular place.	None
A112 then asked PW99 to suggest the best place for keeping a watch.	None
As the information had revealed that the contraband silver was to be landed somewhere at Shekhadi and Shrivardhan area and the same was to be transported via MhasalaGoregaon road, PW99 suggested him two spots for keeping a watch at Purar Phata and Dehan Phata A112 asked all of them to leave the Thane Office and to proceed towards Nagothane.	None
He also accompanied them.	None
All the officers including A112 left Nagothane at about 5.00 p.m. and went to Purar Phata and reached there by sunset.	None
After reaching Purar Phata, A112 called the other Inspectors who were accompanying the squad and disclosed the information that the contraband silver would be transported in transport vehicles such as Truck or Tempo and that Tiger Memon would be piloting the said transport vehicles in the open Commander Jeep and he would be sitting beside the driver with three to four bodyguards sitting behind him and all of them would be fully armed.	None
Before taking positions at Purar Phata, PW99 told A112 that junction of Mhsala Saimorbaugh Mangaon Road and Mhsala Goregaon Road would be better for keeping surveillance and suggested the said spot in order to cover both the said routes coming from Mhasala to Bombay.	None
A112 responded and said that his information was specific that goods will go through Purar Phata Road.	None
At about midnight, A112 called off the watch operation Again, they went to Dehan Phata where A112 told them that the previous day information was also for Dehan Phata.	None

Hence, the deposition of PW99 corroborates and supports the deposition of PW98.	None
Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned counsel for the defence contended that A 112 acted immediately after he received the information about landing smuggling of arms and set up an ambush.	Arguments of Petitioner
The fact that ambush could have been set up at a better location (i.e., at the intersection of two roads going to Bombay) with benefit of hindsight cannot be held against A112.	Arguments of Petitioner
107)	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further contended that no evidence establishes that A112 deliberately set up the ambush at one road so as to permit the vehicles carrying arms to take the other road to Bombay.	Arguments of Petitioner
The above submissions are unacceptable.	None
The evidence of PW99 establishes that the setting up of the ambush at the place of choice of A 112 was done deliberately by him.	None
A112 told his subordinates that he has specific information about the particular route and time of landing.	None
A112 also told them about Tiger Memon.	None
A112 further told them that he has specific information that they will go through Purar Phata.	None
A112 called off the vigil at midnight and does not organize the same after 31st.	None
Ex facie it appears that it could have been an error of judgment of the officer.	None
None of the information on record shows the smuggling of arms would be conducted by Tiger Memon the said goods would be transported through Purar Phata and it would be done only on 30th and 31st night.	None
109) From the topography of the area, it is also clear that the vigil at Purar Phata was kept deliberately to provide a safe passage to the smugglers pic As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, from the aforesaid topography, it is clear that the ambush could have been kept at the junction as suggested by PW99 which could have covered both the routes to Bombay.	None
The materials clearly show that A112 knowingly directed Nakabandi at Purar Phata and Behar Phata which left SaiMorba Road route open for the smugglers to travel safely.	None
It is also brought to our notice that A112 also spread rumour of a specific information when there was none.	None
It is also not clear as to why the vigil was called off at midnight when as a matter of practice smuggling takes place after midnight.	None
It is also not clear why no vigil was kept after 31st night of January, 1993.	None
All the aforesaid was justified on the basis of nonexistence of specific information.	None
The above said conduct of A112 has to be considered in the light of the fact that A112 was duly informed by his superior that they have intelligence that ISI may send weapons along with silver or gold.	None
The said information requested the Officer to be alert.	None
It is also to be seen that the information of the above said landing was the first such information after the alert notice of 25.01.1993.	None
The said information, amongst others, has been proved by PW470.	None
Deposition of SR Bharadwaj (PW470) PW470 was working as Collector of Customs (Preventive) at Bombay.	None
From his testimony, the following facts emerge He was the senior officer and A112 was working under him.	None
ii)	None
On 24/25.01.1993, he received information from DRI that some ISI syndicate located in MiddleEast may try to smuggle contraband items into India.	None
He told A112 and A102 about this information.	None
A112 told him in the end of January that there was no landing of contraband since either the information was leaked or the movement of customs officials was known.	None
PW470 told A112 to ask the local officers to keep the track of the said information.	None
A perusal of deposition of PW470 establishes that he asked A112 to ask local officers to keep track of the said information and further he had issued a letter being Exhibit No. 1536 informing Mr. R.K. Singh (A102) about landing of large quantity of automatic weapons in next 1530 days.	None
This letter was copied to A112 also.	None
The evidence of PW470 has to be considered in the light of the conduct of A112, emerging from the evidence of PW98 and PW99.	None
Deposition of Bhaskar Krishanji Naik (PW168) PW168 was working as a Superintendent, Customs (Marine and Preventive) Wing since 28.12.1992, in Central Intelligence Unit (C.I.U.) at Everest House, Bombay.	None

Singh and which was also forwarded to A112 stating that large quantity of automatic weapons along with contraband items like gold and silver were likely to land around Bombay in the next 1520 days, and therefore, necessary action should be taken.	None
The deposition of this witness proves that A112 had been informed well in advance that landing of arms was going to take place and it could happen anytime within 1520 days from the time the letter was written, i.e., 25.01.1993.	None
Inspite of clear information that large quantity of automatic weapons will land in next 15 days, A112 only kept ambush for 2 days and that too at wrong places and also spread a rumour that the place was appropriate, since he has a specific information.	None
Deposition of Vishwambhal M. Doiphode (PW171) PW171 was Additional Collector of Customs (Rummaging and Intelligence) Bombay.	None

On the night of 01.02.1993, he received a call at about 2 a.m. from his sources informing him that landing of contraband was taking place at Mhasla.	None
PW171 immediately told the same to A112.	None
A112, thereafter, gave an alert message to Mhasla, Bankot and Alibaug divisions.	None
It is pointed out by the prosecution that deposition of PW171 clearly establishes that A112 alerted the customs officials at Bankot and Alibaug also whereas the information received was for landing at Mhasla only.	None
It is argued on the side of the CBI that the paper work of giving alert was done by A112 since the message was given by an Additional Collector and something was to be shown to have been done.	Arguments of Respondent
Exhibit 2594  	Arguments of Respondent
X 711 is the VHF Radio logbook.	Arguments of Respondent
The relevant extract of message reads as under Something has happened at Bankot therefore maximum alert to be kept at D31 division starting immediately It shows that A112 had asked to keep a strict vigil at Bankot in the face of clear and specific information that the landing was to take place at Mhasla.	None
The said specific information was distorted as well as converted into a vague message that something is happening in the Alibaug division which is a very big division.	None
In view of the specific information given by a senior officer, the message circulated by A112 about Bankot was completely misleading since Bankot is about 45 kms.	None

The conduct of A112 has to be considered in the light of the letter dated 25.01.1993 proved by PW470.	None
It may also be considered that the second landing could have been obstructed, if immediate action on the said letter was taken.	None
Even the said arms and ammunitions which landed on 03.02.1993 could have been traced, if the said information was shared with the Customs Department as well as the Police.	None
The appellant not only avoided alerting the Department, but also did not share the said piece of information till 25.03.1993 with the Department.	None
It has been contended by learned senior counsel for A112 that he was surprised to hear about the landing of chemicals instead of silver and thus it can be inferred that A112 was not aware of the landing of RDX at Shekhadi.	None
As per the letter issued by PW470, the information was specific that automatic weapons were to land in next 1520 days near Bombay.	None
Inspite of this clear information, A112 only kept ambush for two days and told the officers on duty that he will issue directions, if further ambush is required.	None

In view of the above, the following facts emerge A112 was fully aware of the information that the weapons of mass destruction may be smuggled to India along with silver and gold He kept vigil at a place which leaves room for the smugglers to escape from another route to Bombay under the guise of specific information He failed to produce any such specific information ever A112 told that he has specific information that Tiger Memon is going to come through that route in a particular manner Actually, there was no specific information that the smuggler was Tiger Memon and that he was to pass through a particular route The onus was on the accused to prove his specific information for a particular course of conduct undertaken by him	None
He also spread rumour of specific information to mislead and misguide the Department so as to help the smugglers He misdirected the Department by distorting a specific message of landing at Mhasla to be something happening at Bankot about 45 kilometers away from Mahasla, particularly, when the said information came from a senior officer of the Department He failed to explain as to why he did that He further failed to take account of what was done pursuant to the said information He did not do anything on specific information that along with Silver some chemicals have arrived at Shekhadi on 03.02.1993 and Any timely action on the part of A112 could have traced the smuggled goods.	None
The said action could have prevented second landing that took place subsequently.	None
All the above said circumstances cumulatively establish the charges framed against A112 at the trial.	None
The said circumstances leave no room for any alternative hypothesis.	None
We are also satisfied that pursuant to a conspiracy with Tiger Memon and his other coconspirators, A112 misused his official position in order to knowingly facilitate the terrorist act.	None
Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the prosecution has established the guilt against the appellant and the Designated Court has rightly convicted him and sentenced him.	Decision

Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad, learned counsel for the appellant (A25), after taking us through the relevant materials relied on by the prosecution, submitted that firstly his own confession is not voluntary and not genuine and, in any event, he retracted the same, hence, the conviction based on his confession is not sustainable.

Taking note of all the above materials, the Designated Court, after analyzing the same, came to the conclusion that the material contained in the confession of A25 clearly reveals his involvement in landing at Shekhadi and its transportation.	None
The corroborative material contained in the confession of A25 i.e. his involvement in landing at Shekhadi and its transportation, for which he was charged with, has also been proved in the confessions of A14, A42 and A61.	None
Considering the role played by him i.e., he was possessing such a large number of arms and ammunitions after the Shekhadi operation was over and was holding the same for a considerable period, the same also denotes that he was a man of close confidence of prime accused persons.	None
The Designated Court also rightly concluded that the act committed by him was for furthering the object of conspiracy and he himself having committed the same during the 1st half of February, 1993 i.e. much prior to even Tiger Memon fixing the target for committing serial bomb blasts in Bombay and is guilty for the offence of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts punishable under Section 3(3) of TADA.	None
In view of the evidence discussed above, we hold that the appellant was actively involved in the conspiracy to cause blasts in Bombay and in consequence of the said involvement, he has committed the offences for which he has been charged and we affirm the same.	Decision
As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, the facts and events stated by the appellant in his own confession are duly corroborated by the confessions of other coaccused, thereby clearly revealing his involvement in the landings at Shekhadi and that he was unauthorisedly in possession of the contraband material.	None
Therefore, the appellant is guilty for the offences for which he has been charged from head firstly to fourthly.	None
Appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra through CBI Criminal Appeal No. 1028 of 2012 Insofar as the appeal filed by the CBI against acquittal of the appellant (A25) for the charge mentioned at head firstly, viz., conspiracy is concerned, in view of the fact that the appellant (A25) has already been convicted for the same and sentenced to RI for life, learned senior counsel for the CBI has not pressed the appeal before this Court, hence, we are of the view that there is no need to consider this appeal in view of the reason appended above and therefore, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.	None
Sentence Regarding sentence, the prosecution submitted that the appellant was given full opportunity to defend himself on the question of quantum of sentence.	Arguments of Respondent
His statement was recorded on 17.10.2006 (Exh.2984) in which he prayed that the following factors, amongst others, may be considered while determining his sentence He is the sole bread winner of his family comprising of his wife and three small children and ii)	None
His wife is suffering from a mental ailment.	None
With respect to the above contentions regarding quantum of sentence, the prosecution submitted that the appellant was in possession and storage of 13 AK56 rifles and 26 magazines for a considerable period of time.	Arguments of Respondent
From the materials, it is clear that the appellant neither dissociated himself nor resisted from participating in the landings at Shekhadi or transportation of contraband material to Waghani Tower nor did he inform the same to the police authorities or took any steps for the same.	None
This is sufficient to show that he was responsible for the blasts in Bombay and he was very well aware of its consequences.	None
In view of the above, we are of the view that the sentence awarded by the Designated Court to the appellant is justified and the same is confirmed.	Decision
Consequently, the appeal is dismissed.	Decision

The appellant prayed that the following, amongst other factors, may be considered while determining his sentence He was the sole bread winner of his family and He was in the government service.	None
The Designated Court, after considering the factors pleaded by the appellant and the nature of crime committed by him, held as under 499considering the facts that A116 was head of local police and as such was duty bound to make every attempt to prevent commission of a crime, but instead of carrying his duty, he had allowed commission of crime and so also further crimes by allowing transportation of contraband material and having acted in such a manner for receiving a bribe amount makes it extremely difficult to accept submission for leniency.	None
As rightly pointed out by learned senior counsel for the CBI, the crime of the appellant may be considered in the light of the fact that he was the protector of law and he has breached the trust of the people of the country.	None

Thus, in view of the above, we reach inescapable conclusion that the appellant has rightly been convicted and sentenced by the Designated Court.	None
The appeal is liable to be dismissed.	None
Appeal by the State of Maharashtra through CBI Criminal Appeal No. 1023 of 2012 As regards the appeal filed by the State for conviction under charge mentioned at head firstly, it is to be noted that the Designated Court has held that A136 acquired knowledge of arms and ammunitions at Dighi Jetty when the goods were being unloaded and has not played any further role except the transportation of the same from Dighi Jetty to Gondghar Phata where they were intercepted by the police party.	None
After careful examination of all the materials placed, we are of the view that in the absence of any positive evidence, A136 cannot be convicted under the charge mentioned at head firstly, i.e., conspiracy and the Designated Court has rightly acquitted him from the said charge.	None
In the light of the above discussion, the appeal of the State is liable to be dismissed.	Decision
Considering the evidence brought on record, the Designated Court held (Part 11) 43A)	None
The aforesaid material in confession of A136 not only reveals his own involvement in Dighi landing episode and himself had become aware at Dighi Jetty that the material brought by sea were also containing arms and ammunitions but also discloses involvement of other coaccused in commission of an act as depicted by the same.	None
43B)	None
The corroborative material to the matters found in confession of A136 regarding his such a deep involvement in Dighi landing episode is also found in confession of coaccused A30, 81 134.	None
43C)	None
Thus carefully considering material contained in confession of A 136 and that of the aforesaid coaccused definitely leads to the conclusion of A136 who was close associate of Mohammed Dossa and Mustafa Dossa the main person responsible for Dighi landing, having committed the offences for which he was charged with at head 2nd ly to 3rd ly.	None
Now considering the acts committed by A136 and more particularly his continuing with the convoy containing arms, his participation in settlement with the police for allowing the convoy to proceed further inspite of his later on knowledge that the same was containing weapons in light of the aforesaid observation leads to no other conclusion but himself having continued to commit the landing operation and further overt acts now for achieving the object of conspiracy.	None
Similarly taking into account that the contraband goods were to contain arms and ammunition i.e. the smuggled goods which could not have been put for any lawful use fortifies the conclusion of A136 having abetted the acts which were committed by the conspirators and or rendered the assistance to them by contravening the provisions of law.	None
Such a conclusion legitimately flows from the said material even accepting that A136 had earlier no knowledge that the goods which had arrived at Dighi Jetty were containing the arms.	None
Now considering the liability of A136 as revealed from the earlier discussion but without once again repeating the dilation made earlier it can be said that the same having revealed that A136 had become aware about the nature of goods after he was told regarding the same and the direction of accused Mustafa Dossa by A134.	None
As dilated earlier, it is clear that though A136 had continued with the said operation i.e. the operation of smuggling for which he had agreed earlier and in the process having committed the offence u s.3 (3) of TADA still he cannot be said to be guilty for the offence of conspiracy to which A134 was said to be party.	None
Needless to add that considering the acts committed by A136, his liability remained confined to having committed the offence u s.3(3) and Sec. 6 of TADA.	None
Sentence It is contended by the counsel for the appellant that A136 was arrested on 04.11.1999 and has already undergone the sentence of about more than 8 (eight and a half) years of actual imprisonment.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Designated Court also heard the appellant on the quantum of sentence.	None
Taking note of all the materials and proved charges mentioned at head secondly and thirdly, we are satisfied that the sentence awarded by the Designated Court cannot be said to be excessive.	None
On the other hand, we are of the view that the sentence awarded by the Designated Court to the appellant is justifiable and acceptable, hence, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.	None

His wife is suffering from TB and low blood pressure since last 8 years and his son had suffered head injury He had been to Shekhadi under the impression that it was landing of silver goods and after realizing that it was not silver, he disassociated himself from the landing He was forced to participate in the second landing since Tiger Memon, Javed Chikna and others had threatened to kill his family members In the said conspiratorial meetings, he protested to carry out any operation as it was the month of Ramzan but he was threatened by Tiger and Javed that he would be shot on the spot if he backs out If he gets a chance, he would be able to look after his family and would be able to lead the life as a law abiding citizen and Ultimately, he was not involved in the commission of any terrorist act and for the acts committed by him, he had undergone sufficient sentence since he has been in custody for about 12 years (as on date approx.	None
18 years), so a lenient view be taken while awarding sentence to him.	None
It is pointed out by the prosecution that all the above factors have been duly considered by the Designated Court and the aforesaid contentions are devoid of any merit having regard to the fact that the appellant had sufficient potential for commission of terrorist acts owing to have acquired training in handling sophisticated arms and ammunitions at Pakistan.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it is stated that his contention that he was forced to participate in the second landing since Tiger Memon, Javed Chikna and others had threatened to kill his family members is not tenable as despite being threatened at the time of first landing and after getting knowledge that the said landing was of arms and ammunitions and explosives, he chose to remain silent instead of approaching the police or taking recourse to law.	Arguments of Respondent
Despite all this, he participated in the second landing at Shekhadi, and moreover, he went to Pakistan at the instance of the same persons who had threatened him.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, when Tiger Memon asked him to be ready, he told him that he was ready on the night of 11.03.1993.	None
It is clear that the contention on behalf of the appellant that he dissociated himself at the time of the first landing at Shekhadi is not made out in the light of other evidence on record.	None
Further, the appellant participated in the acts mentioned above willingly and with complete knowledge.	None
He knew that the arms and ammunitions, RDX and hand grenades which were smuggled into India at Shekhadi would be used for committing terrorist acts.	None
It is clearly established from his confession that Tiger Memon had told his associates that the smuggled arms were to be used to take revenge for the demolition of Babri Masjid and for causing blasts in Bombay.	None
As submitted, the above fact had come to his knowledge after the landing at Shekhadi and much before his going to Pakistan.	None
Despite that, he went to Pakistan via Dubai and received training in handling of arms and ammunitions and explosives.	None
Even in Dubai, he attended the conspiratorial meeting convened by Tiger Memon in which oath was administered to maintain secrecy regarding the aforesaid training and to take revenge.	None
It is also relevant to note that after realizing that explosions took place at various places in Bombay on 12.03.1993, the appellant absconded and remained away from the clutches of law until he was arrested by the police.	None
He stayed at various places in assumed names in order to conceal his identity to avoid his arrest.	None
Thus, his fleeing away after the explosions took place only goes to show his association and involvement in the conspiracy to cause blasts and, undoubtedly, he was a part of it.	None
It also points out his guilt in the commission of the said acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.	None
Therefore, in view of the entire evidence enumerated above, we hold that the appellant was actively involved in the conspiracy to cause blasts in Bombay and in consequence of the said involvement, he has committed the said offences for which he has been charged and the sentence awarded by the Designated Court to the appellant is justified.	Decision
Consequently, the appeals fail and are liable to be dismissed.	Decision

They identified the appellant before the Court during dock proceedings as well as in the test identification parade.	None
They further identified the Maruti Van bearing number MPD13385 as the vehicle in which the appellant along with other coaccused came to the scene of the crime.	None
The contradictions pointed out by the counsel on behalf of the appellant are minor contradictions and does not go to the root of the matter.	None
With regard to the same, the following observations of this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Krishna Master, (2010) 12 SCC 324 are relevant.	None
Before appreciating evidence of the witnesses examined in the case, it would be instructive to refer to the criteria for appreciation of oral evidence.	None
While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.	None
Once that impression is found, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinise the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief.	None
Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hypertechnical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole.	None
If the court before whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and unless the reasons are weighty and formidable, it would not be proper for the appellate court to reject the evidence on the ground of variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details.	None
Minor omissions in the police statements are never considered to be fatal.	None
The statements given by the witnesses before the police are meant to be brief statements and could not take place of evidence in the court.	None
Small Trivial omissions would not justify a finding by court that the witnesses concerned are liars.	None
The prosecution evidence may suffer from inconsistencies here and discrepancies there, but that is a shortcoming from which no criminal case is free.	None
The main thing to be seen is whether those inconsistencies go to the root of the matter or pertain to insignificant aspects thereof.	None
In the former case, the defence may be justified in seeking advantage of incongruities obtaining in the evidence.	None
In the latter, however, no such benefit may be available to it.	None
In the deposition of witnesses, there are always normal discrepancies, howsoever honest and truthful they may be.	None
These discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition, shock and horror at the time of occurrence and threat to the life.	None
It is not unoften that improvements in earlier version are made at the trial in order to give a boost to the prosecution case, albeit foolishly.	None
Therefore, it is the duty of the court to separate falsehood from the truth.	None
In sifting the evidence, the court has to attempt to separate the chaff from the grains in every case and this attempt cannot be abandoned on the ground that the case is baffling unless the evidence is really so confusing or conflicting that the process cannot reasonably be carried out.	None
In the light of these principles, this Court will have to determine whether the evidence of eyewitnesses examined in this case proves the prosecution case.	None
In State of H.P. vs. Lekh Raj, (2000) 1 SCC 247 , it was observed In support of the impugned judgment the learned counsel appearing for the respondents vainly attempted to point out some discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix and other witnesses for discrediting the prosecution version.	None
Discrepancy has to be distinguished from contradiction.	None
Whereas contradiction in the statement of the witness is fatal for the case, minor discrepancy or variance in evidence will not make the prosecutions case doubtful.	None
The normal course of the human conduct would be that while narrating a particular incident there may occur minor discrepancies, such discrepancies in law may render credential to the depositions.	None
Parrot like statements are disfavoured by the courts.	None
In order to ascertain as to whether the discrepancy pointed out was minor or not or the same amounted to contradiction, regard is required to be had to the circumstances of the case by keeping in view the social status of the witnesses and environment in which such witness was making the statement.	None
This Court in Ousu Varghese v. State of Kerala held that minor variations in the accounts of the witnesses are often the hallmark of the truth of their testimony.	None
In Jagdish v. State of M.P. this Court held that when the discrepancies were comparatively of a minor character and did not go to the root of the prosecution story, they need not be given undue importance.	None
Mere congruity or consistency is not the sole test of truth in the depositions.	None
This Court again in State of Rajasthan v. Kalki held that in the depositions of witnesses there are always normal discrepancies, however, honest and truthful they may be.	None
Such discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation, normal errors of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence, and the like.	None
Material discrepancies are those which are not normal and not expected of a normal person.	None
Referring to and relying upon the earlier judgments of this Court in State of U.P. v. M.K. Anthony, Tahsildar Singh v. State of U.P., Appabhai v. State of Gujarat and Rammi v. State of M.P.,this Court in a recent case Leela Ram v. State of Haryana held There are bound to be some discrepancies between the narrations of different witnesses when they speak on details, and unless the contradictions are of a material dimension, the same should not be used to jettison the evidence in its entirety.	None
Incidentally, corroboration of evidence with mathematical niceties cannot be expected in criminal cases.	None
Minor embellishment, there may be, but variations by reason therefor should not render the evidence of eyewitnesses unbelievable.	None
Trivial discrepancies ought not to obliterate an otherwise acceptable evidence The court shall have to bear in mind that different witnesses react differently under different situations whereas some become speechless, some start wailing while some others run away from the scene and yet there are some who may come forward with courage, conviction and belief that the wrong should be remedied.	None
As a matter of fact it depends upon individuals and individuals.	None
There cannot be any set pattern or uniform rule of human reaction and to discard a piece of evidence on the ground of his reaction not falling within a set pattern is unproductive and a pedantic exercise.	None
In Waman vs. State of Maharashtra, (2011) 7 SCC 295 , it was observed It is clear that not all the contradictions have to be thrown out from consideration but only those which go to the root of the matter are to be avoided or ignored.	None
In the case on hand, as observed earlier, merely on the basis of minor contradictions about the use and nature of weapons and injuries, their statements cannot be ignored in toto.	None
To sum up, there are bound to be some discrepancies between the narrations of different witnesses and unless the contradictions are of a material dimension, the same should not be used to disbelieve the evidence in its entirety.	None
In view of the above, we are of the view that the contradictions pointed out by the counsel on behalf of the appellant are minor contradictions and does not render the evidence unbelievable.	None
Investigation, Recoveries and FSL Reports PWs5, 6 and 13 have duly identified the appellant in the TIP dated 15.05.1993 for which memorandum panchnama proved as Exhibit 1515 was prepared by Moreshwar Thakur (PW469).	None
It is contended on behalf of the appellant that there is interpolation in the FIR as White coloured Maruti Van has been changed with dark blue coloured Maruti Van.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have verified the entire contents of the FIR.	None
From the perusal of the entire complaint, it is clear that the colour of Maruti Van was dark blue only and, hence, there is no interpolation.	None

Even though the aforesaid eyewitnesses i.e., PWs105 and 106 have not specifically named the appellant, their confessional statements duly corroborate with the confessional statements of various coaccused that training in fire arms was conducted at the hillocks of Sandheri.	None
As far as naming of the appellant is concerned, mostly, the coaccused persons referred to above have stated to his participation in addition to his own confession.	None
It is further contended on behalf of the appellant that it is an admitted case that there were 3 accused persons by name of Bashir, since the name is very common in Muslims, so there is bona fide doubt about reference to the present appellant in the confessional statements of co accused, viz., A16, A23, A25, A32, A77 regarding his participation in the conspiratorial meetings.	Arguments of Petitioner
On this particular contention, the confessions of A23, A32 and deposition of PW2 are very clear about the presence of the appellant in those meetings and there is no doubt about reference to the appellant.	None
It is also contended on behalf of the appellant that since he has stated in his confessional statement that he was arrested 67 days after the blasts, hence, the date of arrest should be 19/20.03.1993, but actually he has been shown to be arrested on 30.03.1993	Arguments of Petitioner
so he was illegally detained by the police.	Arguments of Petitioner

Further, the evidence with regard to the TIP can only be used as a corroborative piece of evidence and is a test to strengthen trustworthiness of the substantive evidence of the witness before the Court.	None
In the present case, all the witnesses have identified the appellant before the Court and even the SEM on this aspect withstood his cross examination.	None
Further, with regard to the same, this Court in Mulla vs. State of U.P., (2010) 3 SCC 508 , observed as follows As was observed by this Court in Matru v. State of U.P. identification tests do not constitute substantive evidence.	None
They are primarily meant for the purpose of helping the investigating agency with an assurance that their progress with the investigation into the offence is proceeding on the right lines.	None
The identification can only be used as corroboration of the statement in court.	None
(Vide Santokh Singh v. Izhar Hussain.)	None
The necessity for holding an identification parade can arise only when the accused persons are not previously known to the witnesses.	None
The whole idea of a test identification parade is that witnesses who claim to have seen the culprits at the time of occurrence are to identify them from the midst of other persons without any aid or any other source.	None
The test is done to check upon their veracity.	None
In other words, the main object of holding an identification parade, during the investigation stage, is to test the memory of the witnesses based upon first impression and also to enable the prosecution to decide whether all or any of them could be cited as eyewitnesses of the crime.	None
The above said evidence thus substantiates and establishes the charges framed against the appellant.	None

Arguments of Petitioner
It is brought to our notice by the CBI that the confessions of the coaccused viz.	Arguments of Petitioner
A13 and A23, establish the involvement and participation of the appellant in the training programme.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even if the above witnesses have not identified that does not cause any dent on the prosecution case as sufficient evidence has been placed on record by the prosecution to establish the presence and participation of the appellant at Sandheri and Borghat.	None
Juvenile Issue It is contended on behalf of the appellant that he was 17 years and 3 months old on the date of commission of offence and his case ought to have been dealt under the Juvenile Justice (Care Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (in short JJ Act) and the provisions of TADA are inapplicable to his case and the learned Designated Court erred in negating the said contention.	Arguments of Petitioner
Before dealing with this contention, it would be appropriate to first deal with the law on the subject Juvenile Justice (Care Protection of Children) Act, 2000 Preamble	None
An act to consolidate and amend the law relating to juveniles in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection, by providing for proper care, protection and treatment by catering to their need, and by adopting a child friendly approach in the adjudication and disposition of matters in the best interest of children and for their ultimate rehabilitation.	None
Section 1 (4) of the JJ Act was brought into the statute book w.e.f.	None
22.08.2006 which reads as under Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the provisions of this act shall apply to all cases involving detention, prosecution, penalty or sentence of imprisonment of juveniles in conflict with law under any such law Section 2 (k) defines juvenile or child means a person who has not completed eighteen years of age.	None
Section 2 (l) defines juvenile in conflict with law means a juvenile who is alleged to have committed an offence and has not completed eighteen years of age as on the date of commission of such offence.	None
Section 15 deals with the Order that may be passed regarding juvenile which is as under Where a Board is satisfied on inquiry that a juvenile has committed an offence, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time being inforce, the Board may, if it so thinks, fit (g) make an order directing the juvenile to be sent to a special home (before the amendment dated 2282006) in the case of juvenile, over seventeen years but less than eighteen years of age for a period of not less than two years in case of any other juvenile for the period until he ceases to be a juvenile Section 16 deals with the order that may not be passed against Juvenile which is as under Nothwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law for the time being in force no juvenile in conflict with law shall be sentenced to death (or life imprisonment) or committed to prison in default of payment of fine or in default of furnishing security Provided that where a juvenile who has attained the age of sixteen years has committed an offence and the board is satisfied that the offence committed is so serious in nature or that his conduct and behaviour have been such that it would not be in his interest or in the interest of other juveniles in a special home to send him to such special home and that none of the other measures provided under this act is suitable or sufficient, the board may order the juvenile in conflict with law to be kept in such safety and in such manner as it thinks fit and shall report the case for the order of the State Government.	None
xxxxx Section 28 of the JJ Act deals with Alternative Punishment which is as under Where an act or omission constitute an offence punishable under this act and also under any other Central or State act, then notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, the offender found guilty of such offences shall be liable to punishment only under such act as provides for punishment which is greater in degree.	None
In the same light if some of the provisions of the THE TERRORIST AND DISRUPTIVE ACTIVITIES ACT, 1987 may be considered which was also a special act to deal with extraordinary circumstances An act to make special provisions for the prevention of, and for coping with terrorist and disruptive activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.	None
Overriding Effect Section 25 of TADA The provisions of this Act or any rule made thereunder or any order made under any such rule shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than this act or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any enactment other than this Act.	None
Whether Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 prevails over TADA Act, 1987 TADA vs JJ ACT	None
The question does arise as to whether the provisions of JJ Act as well as of TADA provide for overriding effect on any other law for the time being in force and as to whether the provisions of JJ Act would be applicable in case of TADA for the reason that this Court in Hari Ram vs. State of Rajasthan Anr., (2009) 13 SCC 211 , considered the definition of juvenile given under Section 2 (k) (l) for offences committed prior to 01.04.2001 when the JJ Act came into force and held that by virtue of the amendment introduced in Section 20 of the JJ Act, particularly, putting the proviso and explanation to Section 20 of the Act made explicit that in all pending cases including trial, revision, appeal and any other criminal proceedings in respect of a juvenile in conflict with law, the JJ Act would apply retrospectively as if the said provisions had been in force when the alleged offence was committed.	None
More so, Section 7A of the JJ Act made it clear that the issue of juvenile can be raised at any stage of the proceeding and even if the accused ceased to be juvenile on or before the commencement of the JJ Act.	None
Thus, any person who was below 18 years of age on the date of commission of offence, even prior to 01.04.2001 would be treated as juvenile even if the claim of the juvenility is raised after attaining the age of 18 years on or before the commencement of the Act.	None
The Court further held that in borderline cases, the benefit may be given to the accused as the very Scheme behind such legislation is rehabilitatory so as to prevent such offenders from becoming hardened criminals.	None
Under such a statute, the court has responsibility to see that punishment serves social justice which is the validation of deprivation of citizens liberty.	None
Correctional treatment with a rehabilitative orientation may be an imperative of modern penology.	None
Such values may find their roots under Article 19 of the Constitution which itself sanctions deprivation of freedoms provided they render a reasonable service to social defence, public order and security of the State.	None
The Court has categorically held that the JJ Act applies retrospectively and a person can apply even where the criminal proceedings have attained finality.	None
The 1986 Act was subsequently repealed by Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000.	None
On 22.03.2006, Section 2(1) of the Act was amended stating that Juvenile in conflict with law means juvenile who is alleged to have committed an offence and has not completed 18 years of age as on the date of commission of such offence.	None
The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules 2007 (hereinafter referred to as 2000 Rules) were brought into force on 26th October 2007.	None
As per Rule 97(2) all the cases pending which have not received finality will be dealt with and disposed of in terms of the provisions of the 2000 Act as amended on 22.08.2006 and 2007 Rules.	None
This view stands approved and affirmed by a larger bench judgment on reference in Abuzar Hossain Gulam Hossain vs. State of West Bengal (2012) 10 SCC 489.	None
Admittedly, the TADA Act 1985/1987 and JJ Act, 1986/2000, both contained provisions providing overriding effect on any other law for the time being in force.	None
A statute must be interpreted having regard to the purport and object of the Act.	None
The doctrine of purposive construction must be resorted to.	None
It would not be permissible for the court to construe the provisions in such a manner which would destroy the very purpose for which the same was enacted.	None
The principles in regard to the approach of the Court in interpreting the provisions of a statute with the change in the societal condition must also be borne in mind.	None
The rules of purposive construction have to be resorted to which would require the construction of the Act in such a manner so as to see that the object of the Act fulfilled which in turn would lead the beneficiary under the statutory scheme to fulfill its constitutional obligations.	None
It is the duty of the court to adopt a harmonious construction by which both the provisions remain operative.	None
(Vide Cantonment Board, Mhow Anr.	None
vs. M.P. State Road Transport Corpn., AIR 1997 SC 2013 Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. vs. Maddula Ratnavalli Ors., (2007) 6 SCC 81 and Krishna Kumar Birla vs. Rajendra Singh Lodha Ors., (2008) 4 SCC 300 ).	None
Where two statutes provide for overriding effect on the other law for the time being in force and the court has to examine which one of them must prevail, the court has to examine the issue considering the following two basic principles of statutory interpretation 1.	None
leges posteriores priores conterarias abrogant (later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws).	None
2. generalia specialibus non derogant (a general provision does not derogate from a special one.)	None
The principle that the latter Act would prevail the earlier Act has consistently been held to be subject to the exception that a general provision does not derogate from a special one.	None
It means that where the literal meaning of the general enactment covers a situation for which specific provision is made by another enactment contained in the earlier Act, it would be presumed that the situation was intended to continue to be dealt with by the specific provision rather than the later general one.	None
The basic rule that general provisions should yield to the specific provisions is based on the principle that if two directions are issued by the competent authority, one covering a large number of matters in general and another to only some of them, his intention is that these latter directions should prevail as regards these while as regards all the rest the earlier directions must be given effect to.	None
It is a settled legal proposition that while passing a special Act, the legislature devotes its entire consideration to a peculiar subject.	None
Therefore, when a general Act is subsequently passed, it is logical to presume that the legislature has not repealed or modified the former special Act unless an inference may be drawn from the language of the special Act itself.	None
In order to determine whether a statute is special or general one, the court has to take into consideration the principal subject matter of the statute and the particular perspective for the reason that for certain purposes an Act may be general and for certain other purposes it may be special and such a distinction cannot be blurred.	None
Thus, where there is inconsistency between the provisions of two statutes and both can be regarded as special in nature, the conflict has to be resolved by reference to the purpose and policy underlying the two enactments and the clear intendment of the legislature conveyed by the language of the relevant provisions therein.

In Punjab State Electricity Board vs. Bassi Cold Storage, Khara and Anr., AIR 1994 SC 2544 , the question was whether Arbitration would be applicable to all disputes under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.	None
This Court after considering the relevant provisions of the Act 1910 held If the legislature while putting the Act in the statute book would have required that all the disputes between the parties should be subjectmatter of arbitration, there would have been no necessity to mention about some disputes or difference specifically in the aforesaid section as being remediable by arbitration.	None
This clearly shows, according to us, that the legislature did require that the matters enumerated in the Act alone should go for arbitration, and no others.	None

(1987) 1 SCC 424 , this Court highlighted the importance of the rule of contextual interpretation and held Interpretation must depend on the text and the context.	None
They are the bases of interpretation.	None
One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the colour.	None
Neither can be ignored.	None
Both are important.	None
That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual.	None
A statute is best interpreted when we know why it was enacted.	None
.No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation.	None
Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place.	None
In Employees Provident Fund Commr.	None
vs. Official Liquidator, AIR 2012 SC 11 , the question arose as to whether priority given to the dues payable by an employer under Section 11 of the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, is subject to Section 529A of the Companies Act, 1956 in terms of which the workmens dues and debts due to secured creditors are required to be paid in priority to all other debts in view of the nonobstante clause contained in the subsequent legislation, i.e. Section 529A(1) of the Companies Act would prevail over similar clause contained in earlier legislation, i.e. Section 11(2) of the EPF Act.	None
The Court made reference to provisions of both enactments, and placing reliance on earlier judgment in UCO Bank vs. Official Liquidator, High Court, Bombay Anr.	None

Bank Ltd. vs. Assistant Provident Fund Commr.	None
And Ors. (2009) 10 SCC 123 observed The EPF Act is a social welfare legislation intended to protect the interest of a weaker section of the society i.e. the workers employed in factories and other establishments, who have made significant contribution in economic growth of the country.	None
The workers and other employees provide services of different kinds and ensure continuous production of goods, which are made available to the society at large.	None
Therefore, a legislation made for their benefit must receive a liberal and purposive interpretation keeping in view the directive principles of State policy contained in Articles 38 and 43 of the Constitution.	None
This Court held that the nonobstante nature of a provision although may be of wide amplitude, the interpretative process thereof must be kept confined to the legislative policy.	None
The nonobstante clause must be given effect to, to the extent the legislature intended and not beyond the same.	None
In A.P. State Financial Corpn.	None
(supra), this Court held that right to sell the property by Financial Corporation under Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 will be subject to the non obstante clause contained in Section 529A of the Companies Act and observed 10.	None
The Act of 1951 is a special Act for grant of financial assistance to industrial concerns with a view to boost up industrialisation and also recovery of such financial assistance if it becomes bad and similarly the Companies Act deals with companies including winding up of such companies.	None
The proviso to subsection (1) of Section 529 and Section 529A being a subsequent enactment, the non obstante clause in Section 529A prevails over Section 29 of the Act of 1951 in view of the settled position of law.	None
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the above proviso to subsection (1) of Section 529 and Section 529A will control Section 29 of the Act of 1951.	None
In other words the statutory right to sell the property under Section 29 of the Act of 1951 has to be exercised with the rights of pari passu charge to the workmen created by the proviso to Section 529 of the Companies Act.	None
Under the proviso to subsection (1) of Section 529, the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and force (sic enforce) the above pari passu charge.	None
Therefore, the Company Court was fully justified in imposing the above conditions to enable the Official Liquidator to discharge his function properly under the supervision of the Company Court as the new Section 529A of the Companies Act confers upon a Company Court the duty to ensure that the workmens dues are paid in priority to all other debts in accordance with the provisions of the above section.	None
The legislature has amended the Companies Act in 1985 with a social purpose viz.	None
to protect the dues of the workmen.	None
If conditions are not imposed to protect the right of the workmen there is every possibility that the secured creditor may frustrate the above pari passu right of the workmen.	None
Child Rights	None
The Geneva declaration of 1924 on the rights of the child adopted by the League of Nations on 26th September, 1924 provided that mankind owe to the child the best that it has to give, declare and accept it as their duty.	None
Thus, the child must be given the means requisite for its normal development, both materially and spirituality.	None
A hungry child must be fed and further recognised various child rights included that the delinquent child must be reclaimed.	None
The declaration of the right of the child adopted by the United Nations on 20th November, 1959, provides that the child by reason of his physical and mental immaturity needs special safeguards and care including his appropriate legal protection before as well as after birth.	None
The United Nations adopted Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules) dated November 29, 1985.	None
India is a signatory to the Declaration and effectively participated in bringing the Declaration into force.	None
The Rules guide the States to protect childrens rights and respect their needs during the development of separate and particular system of juvenile justice.	None
It is also in favour of meeting the best interests of the child while conducting any proceedings before any authority.	None
If children are processed through the criminal justice system, it results in the stigma of criminality and this in fact amplifies criminality of the child.	None
The Rules say that depriving a child juvenile of his liberty should be used as the last resort and that too, for the shortest period.	None
These Rules direct the Juvenile Justice System to be fair and humane, emphasising the well being of the child.	None
Besides that, the importance of rehabilitation is also stressed demanding necessary assistance in the form of education, employment or shelter to be given to the child.	None
The Juvenile Justice Act 1986 was enacted in pursuance of the Constitutional obligations cast under Article 39 clause (f) of the Constitution of India as well as of commitment to the aforesaid International Conventions.	None
The Convention postulates that State Parties recognise that every child has the inherent right to life.	None
State Parties shall ensure that no child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.	None
Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age.	None
Aims of juvenile justice provide that the juvenile Justice system shall emphasize the wellbeing of the juvenile and shall ensure that any reaction to juvenile offenders shall always be in proportion to the circumstances of both the offenders and the offence.	None
The said Rules further lays down that restrictions on the personal liberty of the juvenile shall be imposed only after careful consideration and shall be limited to the possible minimum and deprivation of personal liberty shall not be imposed unless the juvenile is adjudicated of a serious act involving violence against another person or of persistence in committing other serious offences and unless there is no other appropriate response.	None
The Statement of Objects and Reasons of JJ Act reveal that the Act is in consonance with the provisions under Article 21 of the Constitution read with clause (f) of Article 39 of the Constitution which provides that the State shall direct its policy towards securing the children or give opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and the childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment.	None
The children if come in contact with hardened criminals in jail, it would have the effect of dwarfing the development of the child, exposing him to baneful influences, coarsening his conscience and alienating him from the society.	None
(Vide Sheela Barse Anr.	None

Therefore, there can be no doubt that the J J Act is beneficial in nature i.e. socially oriented legislation.	None
In case the provisions are not complied with, the object of its enactment would be frustrated.	None
Section 6 of JJ Act contains a nonobstante clause giving overriding effect to any other law for the time being in force and provides that Juvenile Justice Board, where it has been constituted, shall have power to deal exclusively with all proceedings under this Act relating to juvenile in conflict with law.	None
Section 18(i) further provides that notwithstanding contained in Section 223 of the Code or any other law for the time being in force, no juvenile shall be charged with or tried for any offence together with a person who is not a juvenile.	None
More so, nonobstante clause contained in various provisions thereof, particularly, Sections 15, 16, 18, 19 and 20 make the legislative intent unambiguous that the JJ Act being a special law would have override effect on any other statute for the time being in force.	None
Such a view stand further fortified in view of the provisions of Sections 29 and 37 which provide for constitution of a Child Welfare Committee which provides for welfare of the children including rehabilitation.	None
Clause (n) of Section 2 of JJ Act defines offence which means offence punishable under any law for the time being in force.	None
So, it means that the said provision does not make any distinction between the offence punishable under IPC or punishable under any local or special law.	None
THE TERRORIST AND DISRUPTIVE ACTIVITIES (PREVENTION) ACT, 1987 The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1985, was enacted in May, 1985, in the background of escalation of terrorist activities in many parts of the country at that time.	None
It was a temporary statute having a life of two years.	None
However, on the basis of experience, it was felt that in order to combat and cope with terrorist and disruptive activities effectively, it was not only necessary to continue the said law but also to strengthen it further.	None
The TADA 1987 provides for a deterrent measures to deal with the menace of such serious offences like terrorism and disruptive activities and for matters connected therewith.	None
Therefore, the object of the Act is to deal with the security of the State as well as the citizens.	None
Section 25 of TADA has a nonobstante clause providing for an overriding effect to the provisions over anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other enactment or any instrument having effect by virtue of any other enactment.	None
Thus, TADA contains many other nonobstante clauses as well.	None
The punishments provided by Sections 5 and 6 of TADA are to be imposed notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law.	None
Section 7 enables the State to confer the power of arrest to certain persons.	None
The Designated Court alone has the jurisdiction to try offences under TADA as revealed under Section 9.	None
Further, Section 20 of TADA provides that irrespective of any provision of the Code or any other law, every offence punishable under the TADA would be deemed to be a cognizable offence.	None
Section 15 provides different special rules of evidence.	None
Section 21 provides for presumption of guilt in specified circumstances and it carves out an exception to the general rule of criminal jurisprudence, though presumption is rebuttable.	None
(Vide Kartar Singh (supra) and Sanjay Dutt (II) (supra).	None
Sections 5 and 6 which are mandatory in nature provide for imposition of minimum sentence to achieve the objectives of the Act.	None
Undoubtedly, TADA applies to deal with an extraordinary situation and problems and extreme measures to be resorted when it is not possible for the State to tackle the situation under the ordinary penal law.	None
TADA provides for a special machinery to combat the growing menace of terrorism in the country specifically where accused cannot be checked and controlled under the ordinary law of the land.	None
Disruptive activities have been defined in clause 2(b) as the Act deals to prevent the menace of terrorism.	None
Terrorism means use of violence when its most important result is not merely the physical and mental damage to the victim but the prolonged physiological effect it produces or has the potentiality of producing on the society as a whole.	None
Terrorism is generally an attempt to acquire or maintain power or controlled by intimidation and causing fear and helplessness in the minds of people at large or any section thereof and it is a totally abnormal phenomenon.	None
Terrorism is distinguishable from other forms of violence as in the former, the deliberate and systematic use of coercive intimidation is used.	None
(Vide Hitendra Vishnu Thakur Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra Ors., (1994) 4 SCC 602 )	None
Disruptive activities have been defined under Section 4(2) which means activities to disturb or intended to disturb directly or indirectly the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India or to bring the cessation of any part of India from the Union.	None
Section 3 provides for punishment for terrorist acts and provides whoever with intention commits such acts shall be punishable.	None
Section 3 provides for punishment for terrorist acts and its submissions started with whoever except clause 5 which starts with any person.	None
Therefore, it covers every person including the juvenile.	None
Section 4(1) provides for punishment for disruptive activities and also uses the same terminology i.e whoever.	None
Section 6 provides for enhanced punishments and refers to any person.	None
Therefore, the phraseology used by legislature included every person whoever he may be.	None
There is no justification whatsoever to restrict the meaning of any person and whoever only to a major or nonjuvenile as such an interpretation would have a potentiality to defeat the object of TADA.	None
Section 12(1) of the J J Act 2000 which is analogous to Section 18(1) of the Act 1986 reads as under Bail of juvenile.(l)	None
When any person accused of a bailable or nonbailable offence, and apparently a juvenile, is arrested or detained or appears or is brought before a Board, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or in any other law for the ? time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a Probation Officer or under the care of any fit institution or fit person but he shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal or expose him to moral, physical or psychological danger or that his release would defeat the ends of justice.	None
(Emphasis added)	None
Therefore, question does arise in case the JJ Act itself provides for an exception under which even bail may not be granted, we cannot accept the contention that JJ Act would override the provisions of TADA in all circumstances without any exception and in case the legislature itself has carved out an exception not to grant relief to a juvenile under the JJ Act, it cannot be held that it would prevail over TADA under all possible circumstances.	None
Ends of justice has not been defined in any statute, however, this expression ends of justice has been used in the Constitution of India under Article 139A(2) that the Supreme Court may, if it deems it expedient so to do for the ends of justice, transfer any case, appeal or other proceedings pending before any High Court to any other High Court.	None
Article 142 of the Constitution empowers this Court to pass an order which may be necessary for doing complete justice in any case or matter pending.	None
Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 confers unlimited inherent powers on the court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice.	None
Section 482 of the Code confers inherent power upon the High Court to pass an order as may be necessary to secure the ends of justice.	None
The words in Section 151 of CPC to secure the seems to be more powerful then the term to meet the ends of justice as the former is of unfathomable limits.	None
It has always been the subject matter of debate as what does the words the ends of justice mean, for the reason that it is one of those questions to which the resigned wisdom applies that man cannot find a definitive answer, but can only try to improve the question.	None
(Vide L. Vijay Kumar vs. Public Prosecutor, A.P., AIR 1978 SC 1485 ).	None
In Delhi Development Authority vs. Skipper Construction Co. (P) Ltd. and Another, AIR 1996 SC 2005 , this Court observed that it is advisable to leave the power undefined and uncatalogued, so that it remains elastic enough to be moulded to suit the given situation.	None
While dealing with such an issue, the court must not lose sight of the fact that meaning of ends of justice essentially refers to justice to all the parties.	None
This phrase refers to the best interest of the public within the four corners of the statute.	None
In fact, it means preservation of proper balance between the Constitutional Statutory rights of an individual and rights of the people at large to have the law enforced.	None
The ends of justice does not mean vague and indeterminate notions of justice, but justice according to the law of the land.	None
(Vide State Bank of Patiala Ors.	None
vs. S.K. Sharma, AIR 1996 SC 1669 and Mahadev Govind Gharge Ors.	None
vs. The Special Land Acquisition Officer, Upper Krishna Project, Jamkhandi, Karnataka, (2011) 6 SCC 321)	None
Thus, the law has to be interpreted in such a manner that it develops coherently in accordance with the principles, so as to serve, even handedly, the ends of justice.	None
Anti social operation of the appellants was not designed against any individual rather proved to be a security risk which imperiled a very large number of innocent persons and damage to the properties worth a very large amount.	None
Section 4(1) of JJ Act was added by amendment with effect from 22.08.2006.	None
In fact, this provision gives the overriding effect to this Act over other statutes.	None
However, it reads that the Act would override anything contained in any other law for the time being in force.	None
The question does arise as to whether the statutory provisions of JJ Act would have an overriding effect over the provisions of TADA which left long back and was admittedly not in force on 22.8.2006.	None
Thus, the question does arise as what is the meaning of the law for the time being in force.	None
This Court has interpreted this phrase to include the law in existence on the date of commencement of the Act having overriding effect and the law which may be enacted in future during the life of the Act having overriding effect.	None
(Vide Thyssen Stahlunion GMBH vs. Steel Authority of India Ltd., AIR 1999 SC 3923 and Management of M.C.D. vs. Prem Chand Gupta Anr., AIR 2000 SC 454 ).	None
Thus, we do not think that the JJ Act would have an overriding effect on TADA which was not in existence on the date of commencement of the provisions of Section 1(4) of JJ Act.	None
TADA, being a special act, meant to curb the menace of terrorist and disruptive activities will have effect notwithstanding the fact that JJ Act is general and beneficial legislation.	None
On perusal of aims and objects of TADA, it is clear that the act is brought into the statute books to deal with a special category of persons, viz., Terrorists.	None
In Madan Singh vs. State of Bihar, (2004) 4 SCC 622 , this Court upheld the convictions made by the Designated Court in respect of accused persons who had killed several police officers in combat.	None
While affirming that the offence committed was rightly charged under Section 3 of TADA, this Court made detailed observations in respect of terrorist activities and held as follows Terrorism is one of the manifestations of increased lawlessness and cult of violence.	None
Violence and crime constitute a threat to an established order and are a revolt against a civilised and orderly society.	None
Terrorism though has not been separately defined under TADA there is sufficient indication in Section 3 itself to identify what it is by an all inclusive and comprehensive phraseology adopted in engrafting the said provision, which serves the double purpose as a definition and punishing provision nor is it possible to give a precise definition of terrorism or lay down what constitutes terrorism.	None
It may be possible to describe it as use of violence when its most important result is not merely the physical and mental damage of the victim but the prolonged psychological effect it produces or has the potential of producing on the society as a whole.	None
There may be death, injury, or destruction of property or even deprivation of individual liberty in the process but the extent and reach of the intended terrorist activity travels beyond the effect of an ordinary crime capable of being punished under the ordinary penal law of the land and its main objective is to overawe the Government or disturb the harmony of the society or terrorise people and the society and not only those directly assaulted, with a view to disturb the even tempo, peace and tranquility of the society and create a sense of fear and insecurity.	None
TADA, thus, being an act enacted for special purposes, as stated above, will have precedence over any other act.	None
Applying the above to the facts of the present case, it is clear that the appellant from his conduct referred to above cannot by any stretch of imagination qualify as a child in need of care and protection as the acts committed by him are so grave and heinous warranting the maximum penalty but the Designated Court after considering all these factors awarded him lesser punishment when the coaccused who accompanied him to Fishermens colony and committed similar acts were awarded with the maximum punishment for heinous acts committed by them along with coaccused.	None
Conclusion Thus, from the reading of the entire evidence placed by the prosecution, it is established beyond doubt that The appellant took oath that he will take revenge against Hindus The appellant received training in handling of arms and explosives at Sandheri and Borghat	None
He attended conspiratorial meeting at the residence of Babloo and Mobina He participated in filling of RDX and iron scraps in vehicles in the intervening night of 11/12.03.1993 at AlHussaini Building He along with other coaccused lobbed handgrenades at Mahim Fishermens colony He possessed 17 handgrenades which were concealed in the overhead water tank of Room No. 27, Chawl No. 22, Transit Camp, Bandra (E), Bombay which were recovered at his instance.	None
Upon a reading of the entire evidence, we hold that all the charges framed against him stand proved beyond any doubt.	None
Sentence The appellant was given full opportunity to defend himself on the question of quantum of sentence.	Facts
The appellant filed statement dated 07.12.2006 on the quantum of sentence which is Exhibit 3051.	Facts
The appellant prayed that the following factors, amongst others, may be considered while determining his sentence His brothers were residing separately after marriage and his mother and two younger brothers were residing with him At the time of his arrest, he was 17 years and 3 months old.	None
He was the sole bread winner of the family.	None
He was working in a beef shop.	None
His father was 70 years old and also suffered with diabetes and high blood pressure.	None
His mother was 60 years old.	None
He had been in custody for about 13 and a half years (vii) He was from a poor family and they could not pay the heavy amount of fine It is seen from the judgment that all the above said factors have been duly considered by the Designated Court while determining on the question of sentence.	None
It was observed 1215)	None
Thus considering gruesome results likely to be ensued by commission of acts and in fact having ensued and still A32, 36, 39 43 without any rhyme or justification or even without any sort of reason plausible or otherwise, committing such acts reveal that each of them was coveted member of conspiracy, of which members had become blind for working out heinous plans hatched by them i.e. the one in which there existed no regard to the life of any person, not even remotely connected with any of them.	None
Needless to add that existence of such persons would be eminently dangerous for the society of law abiding persons.	None
It is difficult to perceive that such persons can be reformed by any type of punishment.	None
However, as stated earlier having due regard to age of A43 and the same to some extent denoting of there being some chance of reforming him necessary concession will be required to be given to him while awarding the sentence.	None
Thus considering the gravity of acts committed by others i.e. A32, 36 39 and still granting him only the sentence of life by ignoring that the acts committed by him has not transcended more than the results ensued due the grace of God and not because of themselves were not having such an intent would amount to ignoring potential danger to the society from existence of such a person.	None
Needless to add any amount of life sentence and or fine would be too inadequate for punishing element of criminality entertained by such accused person and so also the same would be too inadequate to assure the society at large that the arms of law would be well protecting it.	None
All the said factors clearly warrant levying of extreme penalty for such persons.	None
1216)	None
At any rate, the aforesaid discussion being mainly for the offence of conspiracy and so also the commission of terrorist acts by them and during the same considering all the factors relevant to acts a conclusion has been flown that considering the repetition of commission of such acts by each of them, the same would warrant according extreme penalty as prescribed for relevant offence excepting for A43 for whom the same will be required to be given on some what lower pedestal.	None
However, still while awarding the sentence basic principle on which this court has so far progressed that awarding the same on the basis of criminality entertained by concerned accused while committing the act will be required to be borne in mind while prescribing punishment for every distinct offence committed by each of them.	None
The same is necessary that as each of them had committed terrorist acts only one occasion i.e. lobbing hand grenades at Fishermen Colony.	None
Hence the punishment would be required to be awarded for other offences committed by each of them on the same principles on which the same has been awarded to other accused.	None
Since while sentencing the accused persons found guilty for offence under section 5 of TADA no sentence has been awarded to accused also found guilty for commission of offences under Arms Act for the same act, the same criteria will be required to be followed for A43 who has been found guilty for commission for such offences.	None
All the materials placed show that the appellant has knowingly and willingly participated at various stages of the conspiracy.	None
The appellant took training in handling of arms and ammunitions and explosives at Sandheri, attended conspiratorial meetings, kept hand grenades in his possession, actively participated in the preparation of vehicle bombs which were later planted at various locations resulting in the death of hundreds of people and injuries to many others and went to the Fishermens Colony at Mahim and threw hand grenades.	None
Despite being fully aware of the conspiracy, the appellant proceeded to act by taking training, preparation of vehicle bombs and even throwing hand grenades in a populated place, thereby, furthering the object of such a heinous conspiracy.	None
In view of the above discussion, we confirm the conviction and sentence awarded by the Designated Court, consequently, the appeals are dismissed.	Decision

His statement was recorded on 10.10.2006 in which he prayed that the following factors, amongst others, may be considered while determining his sentence He had been in custody for 13 years since his arrest in March, 1993 After the demolition of the Babri Masjid, riots had ensued and he shifted to his fathers residence Thereafter, the locality of Behrampada was attacked and houses were burnt and because of the same, his wife and children had to shift to Alunednagar After his savings were exhausted, he came to Bombay on 9th March, 1993 for taking money from his friend Javed Chikna (v) He worked with Javed Chikna and could not run away as he needed money He had confessed before the police and told them about everything which he had seen The main advocate, defending him in the case, left at a crucial juncture	None
He only has his wife and children, who are totally dependent on him.	None
A perusal of the judgment of the Designated Court shows that all the above factors have been duly considered by the Designated Judge.	None
As rightly pointed out by the prosecution, the aforesaid contentions are devoid of any merit having regard to the fact that the appellant had the knowledge that the smuggled goods had sufficient potential for commission of terrorist acts, owing to the fact that he had also acquired training in handling sophisticated arms and ammunitions.	None
Further, it was contended that the appellant was forced by circumstances to work with Javed Chikna, is not tenable as despite being needy and requiring money at the time of first landing, he got to know that the first landing was of arms and ammunitions and explosives which were capable of causing mass destruction, he chose to remain silent instead of approaching the police or taking recourse to law.	None
Despite all this, he participated in the second landing at Shekhadi, and moreover, he went to Sandheri and took training in handling of arms, ammunition and explosives.	None
The appellant attended crucial conspiratorial meetings also.	None
On the night of 11/12.03.1993, he participated in the filling of RDX in vehicles for the preparation of vehicle bombs.	Facts
He also introduced Gul Mohmed (A77) in the conspiracy and got him recruited for training in handling of arms and ammunitions and explosives at Pakistan.	None
The appellant also undertook reconnaissance of the B.M.C. building and the Stock Exchange building along with A44, PW2, Javed Chikna and Tiger Memon, which were marked as targets for planting bombs.	None
The appellants guilt is further established by the fact revealed in his confession that after the blasts, he left Bombay and went to Ahmednagar.	None
This establishes that he knew that whatever the conspirators had done was wrong and contrary to law.	None
Thus, his claim that he disassociated himself at the time of the first landing at Shekhadi has not been made out in the light of other evidence on record.	None
In fact, he was engaged in the commission of acts furthering the object of such a heinous conspiracy.	None
The appellant participated in the acts mentioned above willingly and with complete knowledge.	None
He knew that the arms and ammunitions, RDX and hand grenades, which were smuggled into India at Shekhadi would be used for committing terrorist acts.	None
It is clearly established from his confession that Tiger Memon had told his associates that the smuggled arms were to be used against Hindus to take revenge for the demolition of Babri Masjid and that they would be used for causing blasts in Bombay.	None
In the light of the above, we hold that the conviction and sentence awarded by the Designated Court to the appellant is justified and there is no ground for interference.	Decision
Consequently, the appeal is accordingly dismissed.	Decision

It was contended by Mr. Aabad Ponda on behalf of the appellant that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he went to Pakistan from Dubai.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further contended that the appellant could have gone anywhere from Dubai and that the prosecution case of his going to Pakistan for training is manufactured one and false.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also contended that, in any event, taking weapons training at Pakistan is by itself not an offence under any Statute whatsoever, and therefore, the appellant cannot be charged for the same and for which he has been wrongly convicted.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been established by the very own confession of the appellant that he had gone to Pakistan from Dubai where he underwent weapons training.	None
The above confession has been corroborated by the confession of coaccused as stated above and, hence, there is no doubt whatsoever that the appellant went to Pakistan from Dubai and acquired training in arms and ammunitions and explosives in order to take revenge against Hindus The passport of the appellant which has been marked as Exh.

The said entries further corroborate with the confessions of various accused persons that they did not have to go through any checking at the Airport in Pakistan.	None
It is further submitted that it was not the case of the appellant before the trial Court that he was elsewhere.	None
Therefore, the evidence on record clearly establishes the charge of going to Pakistan for training against the appellant.	None
The aforesaid evidence clearly establish that the appellant along with other coconspirators was given the said training to equip themselves to commit terrorist acts in Bombay and, therefore, he has rightly been convicted under Section 3(3) of TADA mentioned at head secondly.	None
Thus, in view of the entire evidence enumerated above, we hold that the appellant was actively involved in the conspiracy to cause blasts in Bombay and in consequence of the said involvement, he has committed the offences for which he has been charged.	Decision
