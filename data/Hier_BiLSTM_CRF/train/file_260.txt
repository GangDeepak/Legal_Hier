Facts
Within six days of the signing of the said contract, in letter dated 26.5.2017 the respondent alleged failure on part of the Applicants which was followed by stop work notice dated 03.11.2017.	Facts
It is the case of the Applicants that officials of the respondents were deliberately trying to stall the project and were noncooperative right from the initial stages.	None
Later, a termination notice was issued by the respondent on11.01.2019 alleging noncompliance of contractual obligations on part of the Applicants, which assertions were denied.	None
However, termination letter was issued on 20.02.2019.	Facts
On 11.04.2019 a notice was issued by the Advocate for the applicants invoking the dispute resolution Clause namely Clause 24 as aforesaid raising a claim of Rs.20.95 crores.	Facts
According to the Applicants, a decision in respect of the notice dated 11.04.2019 was required to be taken within one month in terms of Clause 24 of the contract but a communication was sent by the respondent on 10.05.2019 intimating that a reply to the notice would be sent within 30 days.	Facts
An appeal was filed by the Applicants before the Director (Engineering) in terms of said Clause 24 but there was complete failure on part of the Director (Engineering) to discharge the obligations in terms of said Clause 24.	Facts
Therefore, by letter dated 28.06.2019 the Chief Managing Director of the respondent was called upon to appoint a sole arbitrator in terms of said Clause 24.	Facts
However, no appointment of an arbitrator was made within thirty days but a letter was addressed by Chief General Manager of the respondent on 30.07.2019 purportedly appointing one Major General K.T. Gajria as the sole arbitrator.	Facts
The relevant averments in para 3 of the application are The 30 (thirty) day time period for appointment of a sole arbitrator stood expired on 28 th July, 2019 and yet the CMD of the respondent failed to appoint a sole arbitrator or even respond to the letter dated 28 th June, 2019 (received on 29 th June, 2019).	Facts
aa.	Facts
Shockingly, in continuance of its highhanded approach and in contravention to its own letter dated 24 th June, 2019, the CGM of the Respondent addressed the Purported Appointment Letter dated 30 th July, 2019 to one Major General K.T. Gajria thereby purportedly appointing him as a sole arbitrator in the matter.	Facts
On the same date, the CGM of the Respondent also addressed a letter to the Applicants inter alia informing about the purported appointment of Mr. Gajria In the aforesaid premises the Applicants submit The Applicants had duly invoked the arbitration clause (b) The Chairman and Managing Director was the competent authority to appoint a sole arbitrator (c) But the Chief General Manager of the respondent wrongfully appointed the sole arbitrator (d) Such appointment was beyond the period prescribed (e) In any case, an independent and impartial arbitrator is required to be appointed.	Arguments of Petitioner
In response to the application, an affidavitinreply has been filed by the respondent denying all material allegations.	Arguments of Respondent
It is accepted that the contract entered into between the parties contains Clause 24 regarding dispute resolution.	Arguments of Respondent
It is, however, disputed that there was any inaction on part of the respondent in discharging their obligations in terms of Clause 24.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted, inter alia, that The appointment of Major General K.T. Gajria was in consonance with Clause 24 of the contract Such appointment could not in any way be said to be illegal There was no occasion to file an application seeking appointment of any other person under the provisions of Section 11(6) read with Section 11(12)(a) of the Act and In any case, the arbitration in the present matter would not be an International Commercial Arbitration within the meaning of Section 2(1)(f) of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
We heard Mr. Amar Dave, learned Advocate for the Applicants and Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned Senior Advocate for the respondent.	None
It was submitted by Mr. Dave, learned Advocate that on account of failure on part of the respondent in discharging its obligations in terms of Clause 24, the applicants would be entitled to maintain the present Application and seek appointment of an arbitrator as prayed for.	None
It was further submitted that the appointment process contemplated in Clause 24 gave complete discretion to the Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent to make an appointment of an arbitrator of his choice, the Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent would naturally be interested in the outcome or decision in respect of the dispute, the pre requisite of element of impartiality would, therefore, be conspicuously absent in such process and as such it would be desirable that this Court makes an appropriate appointment of an arbitrator.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance was placed on the decisions of this Court in Walter Bau AG (2015) 3 SCC 800 , Legal Successor of the Original Contractor, Dyckerhoff and Widmann, A.G. v. Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and another (2015) 3 SCC 800 and TRF Limited v. Energo Engineering Projects Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 in support of the submissions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Dave, learned Advocate also relied upon the decision of this Court in Larsen and Toubro Limited SCOMI Engineering BHD v. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (2019) 2 SCC 271 to bring home the point that the arbitration in the present matter would be an International Commercial Arbitration.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that no case was made out to maintain the instant application.	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that two basic submissions were raised in para 3 in subpara (z) and (aa) of the application that the Chairman and Managing Director failed to appoint the sole arbitrator within 30 days of the requisition dated 28.06.2019 and that it was the Chief General Manager of the respondent who purportedly made the appointment of a sole arbitrator on 30.07.2019.	Arguments of Respondent
The infirmities thus projected were on two counts, namely, for overstepping the limit of 30 days and secondly the appointment was not made by the Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent.	Arguments of Respondent
He pointed out that the period in terms of requisition dated 28.06.2019 expired on Friday and the appointment was made on the first available working day.	Arguments of Respondent
Secondly, the appointment was actually made by the Chairman and Managing Director but was conveyed by the Chief General Manager, and as such the alleged infirmities were completely nonexistent.	Arguments of Respondent
He further submitted that arbitration, if any, in the instant matter would not be an International Commercial Arbitration.	Arguments of Respondent
The present application, therefore, raises two basic issues first whether the arbitration in the present case would be an International Commercial Arbitration or not.	Issue
In case, it is not, then this Court cannot deal with the application under Section 11(6) read with Section 11(12)(a) of the Act.	Issue
The second issue is whether a case is made out for exercise of power by the Court to make an appointment of an arbitrator.	Issue
During the course of hearing, reliance was placed by the Applicants on the Consortium Agreement entered into between the Applicant No.1 and the Applicant No.2 on 20.09.2016 which described the Applicant No.1 as the lead member of the Consortium.	None
The relevant recital and the Clause of the Agreement were as under WHEREAS all the Parties agree that Perkins Eastman will be the focal point for the agreement and interaction with the client.	None
Perkins Eastman and M s. Edifice Consultants are jointly and severally responsible for the execution of the project In terms of requirements of the bid documents and RFP a Declaration for Lead Member of the Consortium (Form E) was also submitted.	None
The declaration was as under WHEREAS M s. HSCC (India) Ltd. (HSCC) (the Client) has invited Bids Bids from the interested parties for providing Comprehensive Planning and Designing of the Proposed All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Mangalagiri, Guntur (AP).	None
AND WHEREAS, the members of the Consortium are interested in bidding for the Project and implementing the Project in accordance with theterms and conditions of the Request for Bid (RFP) document, Terms of Reference, Clients Requirement, Notice Inviting Bid, Instructions to Bidders, Conditions of Contract and other connected documents in respect of the Project, and AND WHEREAS, it is necessary under the RFP document for the members of the Consortium Bidder to designate one of them as the Lead Manager with all necessary power and authority to do for and on behalf of the Consortium bidder, all acts, deeds and things as may be necessary in connection with the Consortium Bidders proposal for the Project.	None
NOW THIS DECLARATION WITNESSETH THAT We, Perkins Eastman Architects DPC, and having its registered office at 115 5 th Ave Floor 3, New York, NY 1000310004, USA and M s. Edifice Consultants Private Limited having its registered office at Srirams Arcade, 3 rd Floor, Opp.	None
Govandi P.O., Off Govandi Station Road, Govandi East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400088 do hereby designate Perkins Eastman Architects DPC being one of the members of the Consortium, as the Lead Member of the Consortium, to do on behalf of the Consortium, all or any of the acts, deeds of things necessary or incidental to the Consortiums Application Bid for the Project, including submission of Application Bid, participating in conferences, responding to queries, submission of information documents and generally to represent the Consortium in all its dealings with HSCC, any other Government Agency or any person, in connection with the Project until culmination of the process of bidding and thereafter till the completion of the Contract.	None
It is not disputed by the respondent that it was a requisite condition to declare a lead member of the Consortium and that by aforesaid declaration the applicant No.1 was shown to be the lead member of theConsortium.	Reasoning
The reliance is however placed by the respondent on Clause 9 of the Consortium Agreement by virtue of which both the Applicants would be jointly and severely responsible for the execution of the project.	Reasoning
It is clear that the declaration shows that the Applicant No.1 was accepted to be the lead member of the Consortium.	Reasoning
Even if the liability of both the Applicants was stated in Clause 9 to be joint and several, that by itself would not change the status of the Applicant No.1 to be the lead member.	Reasoning
We shall, therefore, proceed on the premise that Applicant No.1 is the lead member of the Consortium.	Reasoning
In Larsen and Toubro Limited SCOMI Engineering BHD 5 more or less similar fact situation came up for consideration.	Reasoning
The only distinction was that the lead member in the consortium was an entity registered in India.	Reasoning
Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 15, 17, 18 and 19 of the decision are as under Since disputes arose between the parties to the agreement, various interim claims had been made by the Consortium of M s Larsen and Toubro, an Indian company, together with Scomi Engineering Bhd, a company incorporated in Malaysia, for which the Consortium has filed this petition under Section 11 of the Act to this Court, since according to them, one of the parties to the arbitration agreement, being a body corporate, incorporated in Malaysia, would be a body corporate, which is incorporated in a country other than India, which would attract Section 2(1)(f)(ii) of the Act.	None
Shri Gopal Jain, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Consortium, has taken us through the agreement, in which he strongly relies upon the fact that the two entities, that is, the Indian company and the Malaysian company, though stated to be a Consortium, are jointly and severally liable, to the employer.	None
The learned Senior Counsel has also relied upon the fact that throughout the working of the contract, separate claims have been made, which have been rejected by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as MMRDA).	None
He has also further relied upon the fact that by at least three letters, during the working of the agreement, the claims have in fact been rejected altogether and that, therefore, there is no impediment in invoking the arbitration Clause under Section 20.4 of the general conditions of contract (hereinafter referred to as GCC), as the procedure outlined by Clauses 20.1 to 20.3 had already been exhausted.	None
On the other hand, Mr Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of MMRDA, the respondent, has relied upon both the contract dated 9 12009 as well as the actual consortium agreement dated 462008 between the Indian company and the Malaysian company, which, when read together, would show that they are really an unincorporated association and would, therefore, fall within Section 2(1)(f)(iii) as being an association or a body of individuals, provided the central management and control is exercised in any country other than India.	None
Section 2(1)(f)(iii) of the Act refers to two different sets of persons an association as distinct and separate from a body of individuals.	None
For example, under Section 2(31) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, person is defined as including, under sub clause (v), an association of persons, or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not.	None
It is in this sense, that an association is referred to in Section 2(1) (f)(iii) which would therefore include a consortium consisting of two or more bodies corporate, at least one of whom is a body corporate incorporated in a country other than India.	None
Law Commission Report No. 246 of August 2014, which made several amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, gave the following reason for deleting the words a company or (iii) In subsection (1), clause (f), subclause (iii), delete the words a company or before the words an association or a body of individuals.	None
Note.	None
The reference to a company in sub section (iii) has been removed since the same is already covered under subsection (ii).	None
The intention is to determine the residence of a company based on its place of incorporation and not the place of central management control.	None
This further reenforces the place of incorporation principle laid down by the Supreme Court in TDM Infrastructure (P) Ltd. v. UE Development India (P) Ltd. (2008) 14 SCC 271 , and adds greater certainty in case of companies having a different place of incorporation and place of exercise of central management and control.	None
It would become clear that prior to the deletion of the expression a company or, there were three sets of persons referred to in Section 2(1)(f)(iii) as separate and distinct persons who would fall within the said subclause.	None
This does not change due to the deletion of the phrase a company or for the reason given by the Law Commission.	None
This is another reason as to why an association cannot be read with body of individuals which follows it but is a separate and distinct category by itself, as is understood from the definition of person as defined in the Income Tax Act referred to above.	None
This being the case, coupled with the fact, as correctly argued by Shri Divan, that the Indian company is the lead partner, and that the Supervisory Board constituted under the consortium agreement makes it clear that the lead partner really has the determining voice in that it appoints the Chairman of the said Board (undoubtedly, with the consent of other members) and the fact that the Consortiums office is in Wadala, Mumbai as also that the lead member shall lead the arbitration proceedings, would all point to the fact that the central management and control of this Consortium appears to be exercised in India and not in any foreign nation.	None
This being the case, we dismiss the petition filed under Section 11 of the Act, as there is no international commercial arbitration as defined under Section 2(1)(f) of the Act for the petitioner to come to this Court.	None
We also do not deem it necessary to go into whether the appropriate stage for invoking arbitration has yet been reached.	None
It was thus held that Association and Body of individuals referred to in Section 2(1)(f) of the Act would be separate categories.	Reasoning
However, the lead member of the Association in that case being an Indian entity, the Central Management and Control of the Association was held to be in a country other than India.	Reasoning
Relying on said decision we conclude that the lead member of the Consortium company i.e. Applicant No.1 being an Architectural Firm having its registered office in New York, requirements of Section 2(1)(f) of the Act are satisfied and the arbitration in the present case would be an International Commercial Arbitration.	Reasoning
That takes us to the second issue, namely, whether a case has been made out for exercise of power by the Court for an appointment of an arbitrator.	Issue
The communication invoking arbitration in terms of Clause 24 was sent by the Applicants on 28.06.2019 and the period within which the respondent was to make the necessary appointment expired on 28.07.2019.	None
The next day was a working day but the appointment was made on Tuesday, the 30 th July, 2019.	None
Technically, the appointment was not within the time stipulated but such delay on part of the respondent could not be said to be an infraction of such magnitude that exercise of power by the Court under Section 11 of the Act merely on that ground is called for.	None
However, the point that has been urged, relying upon the decision of this Court in Walter Bau AG (2015) 3 SCC 800 and TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 , requires consideration.	None
In the present case Clause 24 empowers the Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent to make the appointment of a sole arbitrator and said Clause also stipulates that no person other than a person appointed by such Chairman and Managing Director of the respondent would act as an arbitrator.	Arguments of Petitioner
In TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 , a Bench of three Judges of this Court, was called upon to consider whether the appointment of an arbitrator made by the Managing Director of the respondent therein was a valid one and whether at that stage an application moved under Section 11(6) of the Act could be entertained by the Court.	Reasoning
The relevant Clause, namely, Clause 33 which provided for resolution of disputes in that case was under Resolution of dispute arbitration In case any disagreement or dispute arises between the buyer and the seller under or in connection with the PO, both shall make every effort to resolve it amicably by direct informal negotiation.	None
If, even after 30 days from the commencement of such informal negotiation, seller and the buyer have not been able to resolve the dispute amicably, either party may require that the dispute be referred for resolution to the formal mechanism of arbitration.	None
All disputes which cannot be settled by mutual negotiation shall be referred to and determined by arbitration as per the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 as amended.	None
Unless otherwise provided, any dispute or difference between the parties in connection with this agreement shall be referred to sole arbitration of the Managing Director of buyer or his nominee.	None
Venue of arbitration shall be Delhi, and the arbitration shall be conducted in English language.	None
The award of the Tribunal shall be final and binding on both, buyer and seller.	None
In TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 , the Agreement was entered into before the provisions of the Amending Act (Act No.3 of 2016) came into force.	None
It was submitted by the appellant that by virtue of the provisions of the Amending Act and insertion of the Fifth and Seventh Schedules in the Act, the Managing Director of the respondent would be a person having direct interest in the dispute and as such could not act as an arbitrator.	None
The extension of the submission was that a person who himself was disqualified and disentitled could also not nominate any other person to act as an arbitrator.	None
The submission countered by the respondent therein was as under  7.1.	None
The submission to the effect that since the Managing Director of the respondent has become ineligible to act as an arbitrator subsequent to the amendment in the Act, he could also not have nominated any other person as arbitrator is absolutely unsustainable, for the Fifth and the Seventh Schedules fundamentally guide in determining whether circumstances exist which give rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator.	None
To elaborate, if any person whose relationship with the parties or the counsel or the subjectmatter of dispute falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule, he is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator but not otherwise.	None
The issue was discussed and decided by this Court as under First, we shall deal with Clause (d).	None
There is no quarrel that by virtue of Section 12(5) of the Act, if any person who falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as the arbitrator.	None
There is no doubt and cannot be, for the language employed in the Seventh Schedule, the Managing Director of the Corporation has become ineligible by operation of law.	None
It is the stand of the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant that once the Managing Director becomes ineligible, he also becomes ineligible to nominate.	None
Refuting the said stand, it is canvassed by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent that the ineligibility cannot extend to a nominee if he is not from the Corporation and more so when there is apposite and requisite disclosure.	None
We think it appropriate to make it clear that in the case at hand we are neither concerned with the disclosure nor objectivity nor impartiality nor any such other circumstance.	None
We are singularly concerned with the issue, whether the Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an arbitrator.	None
At the cost of repetition, we may state that when there are two parties, one may nominate an arbitrator and the other may appoint another.	None
That is altogether a different situation.	None
If there is a clause requiring the parties to nominate their respective arbitrator, their authority to nominate cannot be questioned.	None
What really in that circumstance can be called in question is the procedural compliance and the eligibility of their arbitrator depending upon the norms provided under the Act and the Schedules appended thereto.	None
But, here is a case where the Managing Director is the named sole arbitrator and he has also been conferred with the power to nominate one who can be the arbitrator in his place.	Reasoning
Thus, there is subtle distinction.	None
In this regard, our attention has been drawn to a twoJudge Bench decision in State of Orissa v. Commr. of Land Records Settlement (1998) 7 SCC 162 .	None
In the said case, the question arose, can the Board of Revenue revise the order passed by its delegate.	None
Dwelling upon the said proposition, the Court held (SCC p. 173, para 25)	None
We have to note that the Commissioner when he exercises power of the Board delegated to him under Section 33 of the Settlement Act, 1958, the order passed by him is to be treated as an order of the Board of Revenue and not as that of the Commissioner in his capacity as Commissioner.	None
This position is clear from two rulings of this Court to which we shall presently refer.	None
The first of the said rulings is the one decided by the Constitution Bench of this Court in Roop Chand v. State of Punjab AIR 1963 SC 1503 .	None
In that case, it was held by the majority that where the State Government had, under Section 41(1) of the East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948, delegated its appellate powers vested in it under Section 21(4) to an officer, an order passed by such an officer was an order passed by the State Government itself and not an order passed by any officer under this Act within Section 42 and was not revisable by the State Government.	None
It was pointed out that for the purpose of exercise of powers of revision by the State under Section 42 of that Act, the order sought to be revised must be an order passed by an officer in his own right and not as a delegate of the State.	None
The State Government was, therefore, not entitled under Section 42 to call for the records of the case which was disposed of by an officer acting as its delegate.	None
(emphasis in original)	None
Be it noted in the said case, reference was made to Behari Kunj Sahkari Awas Samiti v. State of U.P .	None
(1997) 7 SCC 37 , which followed the decision in Roop Chand v. State of Punjab .	None
It is seemly to note here that the said principle has been followed in Indore Vikas Pradhikaran (2007) 8 SCC 705 .	None
Mr Sundaram has strongly relied on Pratapchand Nopaji (1975) 2 SCC 208 .	None
In the said case, the threeJudge Bench applied the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se.	None
We may profitably reproduce the passage (SCC p. 214, para 9)	None
The principle which would apply, if the objects are struck by Section 23 of the Contract Act, is embodied in the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se (what one does through another is done by oneself).	None
To put it in another form, that which cannot be done directly may not be done indirectly by engaging another outside the prohibited area to do the illegal act within the prohibited area.	None
It is immaterial whether, for the doing of such an illegal act, the agent employed is given the wider powers or authority of the pucca adatia, or, as the High Court had held, he is clothed with the powers of an ordinary commission agent only.	None
The aforesaid authorities have been commended to us to establish the proposition that if the nomination of an arbitrator by an ineligible arbitrator is allowed, it would tantamount to carrying on the proceeding of arbitration by himself.	None
According to the learned counsel for the appellant, ineligibility strikes at the root of his power to arbitrate or get it arbitrated upon by a nominee.	None
In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy would be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the Managing Director, nominate an arbitrator, who may be otherwise eligible and a respectable person.	None
As stated earlier, we are neither concerned with the objectivity nor the individual respectability.	None
We are only concerned with the authority or the power of the Managing Director.	None
By our analysis, we are obligated to arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator has become ineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate another as an arbitrator.	None
The arbitrator becomes ineligible as per prescription contained in Section 12(5) of the Act.	None
It is inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible can nominate a person.	None
Needless to say, once the infrastructure collapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse.	None
One cannot have a building without the plinth.	None
Or to put it differently, once the identity of the Managing Director as the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to nominate someone else as an arbitrator is obliterated.	None
Therefore, the view expressed by the High Court is not sustainable and we say so.	None
It was thus held that as the Managing Director became ineligible by operation of law to act as an arbitrator, he could not nominate another person to act as an arbitrator and that once the identity of the Managing Director as the sole arbitrator was lost, the power to nominate someone else as an arbitrator was also obliterated.	Reasoning
The relevant Clause in said case had nominated the Managing Director himself to be the sole arbitrator and also empowered said Managing Director to nominate another person to act as an arbitrator.	None
The Managing Director thus had two capacities under said Clause, the first as an arbitrator and the second as an appointing authority.	None
In the present case we are concerned with only one capacity of the Chairman and Managing Director and that is as an appointing authority.	None
We thus have two categories of cases.	None
The first, similar to the one dealt with in TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 where the Managing Director himself is named as an arbitrator with an additional power to appoint any other person as an arbitrator.	Reasoning
In the second category, the Managing Director is not to act as an arbitrator himself but is empowered or authorised to appoint any other person of his choice or discretion as an arbitrator.	Reasoning
If, in the first category of cases, the Managing Director was found incompetent, it was because of the interest that he would be said to be having in the outcome or result of the dispute.	Reasoning
The element of invalidity would thus be directly relatable to and arise from the interest that he would be having in such outcome or decision.	Reasoning
If that be the test, similar invalidity would always arise and spring even in the second category of cases.	Reasoning
If the interest that he has in the outcome of the dispute, is taken to be the basis for the possibility of bias, it will always be present irrespective of whether the matter stands under the first or second category of cases.	Reasoning
We are conscious that if such deduction is drawn from the decision of this Court in TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 , all cases having clauses similar to that with which we are presently concerned, a party to the agreement would be disentitled to make any appointment of an Arbitrator on its own and it would always be available to argue that a party or an official or an authority having interest in the dispute would be disentitled to make appointment of an Arbitrator.	Reasoning
But, in our view that has to be the logical deduction from TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 .	Reasoning
Paragraph 50 of the decision shows that this Court was concerned with the issue, whether the Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an Arbitrator The ineligibility referred to therein, was as a result of operation of law, in that a person having an interest in the dispute or in the outcome or decision thereof, must not only be ineligible to act as an arbitrator but must also not be eligible to appoint anyone else as an arbitrator and that such person cannot and should not have any role in charting out any course to the dispute resolution by having the power to appoint an arbitrator.	Reasoning
The next sentences in the paragraph, further show that cases where both the parties could nominate respective arbitrators of their choice were found to be completely a different situation.	Reasoning
The reason is clear that whatever advantage a party may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by equal power with the other party.	Reasoning
But, in a case where only one party has a right to appoint a sole arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of exclusivity in determining or charting the course for dispute resolution.	Reasoning
Naturally, the person who has an interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator.	Reasoning
That has to be taken as the essence of the amendments brought in by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 (Act 3 of 2016) and recognised by the decision of this Court in TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 .	Reasoning
We must also at this stage refer to the following observations made by this Court in para 48 of its decision in Indian Oil Corpn.	None
Ltd. v. Raja Transport (P) Ltd. (2009) 8 SCC 520 , which were in the context that was obtaining before Act 3 of 2016 had come into force  In the light of the above discussion, the scope of Section 11 of the Act containing the scheme of appointment of arbitrators may be summarised thus Where the agreement provides for arbitration with three arbitrators (each party to appoint one arbitrator and the two appointed arbitrators to appoint a third arbitrator), in the event of a party failing to appoint an arbitrator within 30 days from the receipt of a request from the other party (or the two nominated arbitrators failing to agree on the third arbitrator within 30 days from the date of the appointment), the Chief Justice or his designate will exercise power under subsection (4) of Section 11 of the Act.	None
Where the agreement provides for arbitration by a sole arbitrator and the parties have not agreed upon any appointment procedure, the Chief Justice or his designate will exercise power under subsection (5) of Section 11, if the parties fail to agree on the arbitration within thirty days from the receipt of a request by a party from the other party.	None
Where the arbitration agreement specifies the appointment procedure, then irrespective of whether the arbitration is by a sole arbitrator or by a three member Tribunal, the Chief Justice or his designate will exercise power under subsection (6) of Section 11, if a party fails to act as required under the agreed procedure (or the parties or the two appointed arbitrators fail to reach an agreement expected of them under the agreed procedure or any person institution fails to perform any function entrusted to him it under that procedure).	None
While failure of the other party to act within 30 days will furnish a cause of action to the party seeking arbitration to approach the Chief Justice or his designate in cases falling under subsections (4) and (5), such a timebound requirement is not found in subsection (6) of Section 11.	None
The failure to act as per the agreed procedure within the timelimit prescribed by the arbitration agreement, or in the absence of any prescribed timelimit, within a reasonable time, will enable the aggrieved party to file a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act.	None
Where the appointment procedure has been agreed between the parties, but the cause of action for invoking the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his designate under clauses (a), (b) or (c) of subsection (6) has not arisen, then the question of the Chief Justice or his designate exercising power under sub section (6) does not arise.	None
The condition precedent for approaching the Chief Justice or his designate for taking necessary measures under subsection (6) is that a party failing to act as required under the agreed appointment procedure or the parties (or the two appointed arbitrators) failing to reach an agreement expected of them under the agreed appointment procedure or a person institution who has been entrusted with any function under the agreed appointment procedure, failing to perform such function.	None
The Chief Justice or his designate while exercising power under subsection (6) of Section 11 shall endeavour to give effect to the appointment procedure prescribed in the arbitration clause.	None
If circumstances exist, giving rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person nominated, or if other circumstances warrant appointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate may, for reasons to be recorded ignore the designated arbitrator and appoint someone else.	None
Sub para (vii) of aforesaid paragraph 48 lays down that if there are justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person nominated, and if other circumstances warrant appointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, such appointment can be made by the Court.	None
It may also be noted that on the issue of necessity and desirability of impartial and independent arbitrators the matter was considered by the Law Commission in its report No.246.	None
Paragraphs 53 to 60 under the heading Neutrality of Arbitrators are quoted in the Judgment of this Court in Voestapline Schienen Gmbh v. Delhi Metro Rail Corpn.	None
Ltd. (2017) 4 SCC 665 , while paras 59 and 60 of the report stand extracted in the decision of this Court in Bharat Broadband Network (2019) 5 SCC 755 .	None
For the present purposes, we may rely on paragraph 57, which is to the following effect The balance between procedural fairness and binding nature of these contracts, appears to have been tilted in favour of the latter by the Supreme Court, and the Commission believes the present position of law is far from satisfactory.	None
Since the principles of impartiality and independence cannot be discarded at any stage of the proceedings, specifically at the stage of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, it would be incongruous to say that party autonomy can be exercised in complete disregard of these principles even if the same has been agreed prior to the disputes having arisen between the parties.	None
There are certain minimum levels of independence and impartiality that should be required of the arbitral process regardless of the parties apparent agreement.	None
A sensible law cannot, for instance, permit appointment of an arbitrator who is himself a party to the dispute, or who is employed by (or similarly dependent on) one party, even if this is what the parties agreed.	None
The Commission hastens to add that Mr P.K. Malhotra, the ex officio member of the Law Commission suggested having an exception for the State, and allow State parties to appoint employee arbitrators.	None
The Commission is of the opinion that, on this issue, there cannot be any distinction between State and nonState parties.	None
The concept of party autonomy cannot be stretched to a point where it negates the very basis of having impartial and independent adjudicators for resolution of disputes.	None
In fact, when the party appointing an adjudicator is the State, the duty to appoint an impartial and independent adjudicator is that much more onerous and the right to natural justice cannot be said to have been waived only on the basis of a prior agreement between the parties at the time of the contract and before arising of the disputes.	None
In Voestalpine 3 , this Court dealt with independence and impartiality of the arbitrator as under Independence and impartiality of the arbitrator are the hallmarks of any arbitration proceedings.	None
Rule against bias is one of the fundamental principles of natural justice which applied to all judicial and quasi judicial proceedings.	Reasoning
It is for this reason that notwithstanding the fact that relationship between the parties to the arbitration and the arbitrators themselves are contractual in nature and the source of an arbitrators appointment is deduced from the agreement entered into between the parties, notwithstanding the same nonindependence and non impartiality of such arbitrator (though contractually agreed upon) would render him ineligible to conduct the arbitration.	Reasoning
The genesis behind this rational is that even when an arbitrator is appointed in terms of contract and by the parties to the contract, he is independent of the parties.	Reasoning
Functions and duties require him to rise above the partisan interest of the parties and not to act in, or so as to further, the particular interest of either parties.	Reasoning
After all, the arbitrator has adjudicatory role to perform and, therefore, he must be independent of parties as well as impartial.	Reasoning
The United Kingdom Supreme Court has beautifully highlighted this aspect in Hashwani v. Jivraj (2011) 1 WLR 1872 2011 UKSC 40 in the following words (WLR p. 1889, para 45) 45.	Reasoning
the dominant purpose of appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators is the impartial resolution of the dispute between the parties in accordance with the terms of the agreement and, although the contract between the parties and the arbitrators would be a contract for the provision of personal services, they were not personal services under the direction of the parties.21.	Reasoning
Similarly, Cour de Cassation, France, in a judgment delivered in 1972 in Consorts Ury, underlined that an independent mind is indispensable in the exercise of judicial power, whatever the source of that power may be, and it is one of the essential qualities of an arbitrator.22.	Reasoning
Independence and impartiality are two different concepts.	Reasoning
An arbitrator may be independent and yet, lack impartiality, or vice versa.	Reasoning
Impartiality, as is well accepted, is a more subjective concept as compared to independence.	Reasoning
Independence, which is more an objective concept, may, thus, be more straightforwardly ascertained by the parties at the outset of the arbitration proceedings in light of the circumstances disclosed by the arbitrator, while partiality will more likely surface during the arbitration proceedings. .	Reasoning
Time has come to send positive signals to the international business community, in order to create healthy arbitration environment and conducive arbitration culture in this country.	Reasoning
Further, as highlighted by the Law Commission also in its report, duty becomes more onerous in government contracts, where one of the parties to the dispute is the Government or public sector undertaking itself and the authority to appoint the arbitrator rests with it.	Reasoning
In the instant case also, though choice is given by DMRC to the opposite party but it is limited to choose an arbitrator from the panel prepared by DMRC.	Reasoning
It, therefore, becomes imperative to have a much broadbased panel, so that there is no misapprehension that principle of impartiality and independence would be discarded at any stage of the proceedings, specially at the stage of constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.	Reasoning
We, therefore, direct that DMRC shall prepare a broadbased panel on the aforesaid lines, within a period of two months from today.	Reasoning
In the light of the aforestated principles, the report of the Law Commission and the decision in Voestapline Schienen Gmbh , the imperatives of creating healthy arbitration environment demand that the instant application deserves acceptance.	Reasoning
The further question that arises is whether the power can be exercised by this Court under Section 11 of the Act when the appointment of an arbitrator has already been made by the respondent and whether the appellant should be left to raise challenge at an appropriate stage in terms of remedies available in law.	Issue
Similar controversy was gone into by a Designated Judge of this Court in Walter Bau AG (2015) 3 SCC 800 and the discussion on the point was as under While it is correct that in Antrix (2014) 11 SCC 560 and Pricol Ltd. (2015) 4 SCC 177 , it was opined by this Court that after appointment of an arbitrator is made, the remedy of the aggrieved party is not under Section 11(6) but such remedy lies elsewhere and under different provisions of the Arbitration Act (Sections 12 and 13), the context in which the aforesaid view was expressed cannot be lost sight of.	None
In Antrix (2014) 11 SCC 560 , appointment of the arbitrator, as per the ICC Rules, was as per the alternative procedure agreed upon, whereas in Pricol Ltd.	None
(2015) 4 SCC 177 .	None
, the party which had filed the application under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act had already submitted to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.	None
In the present case, the situation is otherwise.	None
Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid and such appointment satisfies the Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act, acceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar the jurisdiction under Section 11(6) cannot be countenanced in law.	Reasoning
In the present case, the agreed upon procedure between the parties contemplated the appointment of the arbitrator by the second party within 30 days of receipt of a notice from the first party.	None
While the decision in Datar Switchgears Ltd. 18 may have introduced some flexibility in the time frame agreed upon by the parties by extending it till a point of time anterior to the filing of the application under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act, it cannot be lost sight of that in the present case the appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is clearly contrary to the provisions of the Rules governing the appointment of arbitrators by ICADR, which the parties had agreed to abide by in the matter of such appointment.	None
The option given to the respondent Corporation to go beyond the panel submitted by ICADR and to appoint any person of its choice was clearly not in the contemplation of the parties.	None
If that be so, obviously, the appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is non est in law.	None
Such an appointment, therefore, will not inhibit the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act.	None
It cannot, therefore, be held that the present proceeding is not maintainable in law.	None
The appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane made beyond 30 days of the receipt of notice by the petitioner, though may appear to be in conformity with the law laid down in Datar Switchgears Ltd (2000) 8 SCC 151 .	None
, is clearly contrary to the agreed procedure which required the appointment made by the respondent Corporation to be from the panel submitted by ICADR.	None
The said appointment, therefore, is clearly invalid in law.	None
It may be noted here that the aforesaid view of the Designated Judge in Walter Bau AG (2015) 3 SCC 800 was pressed into service on behalf of the appellant in TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 and the opinion expressed by the Designated 1Judge was found to be in consonance with the binding authorities of this Court.	Reasoning
It was observed 32 Mr Sundaram, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant has also drawn inspiration from the judgment passed by the Designated Judge of this Court in Walter Bau AG (2015) 3 SCC 800 , where the learned Judge, after referring to Antrix Corpn.	Reasoning
Ltd 16 .	Reasoning
, distinguished the same and also distinguished the authority in Pricol Ltd. v. Johnson Controls Enterprise Ltd. 17 and came to hold that (Walter Bau AG case (2015) 3 SCC 800 , SCC p. 806, para 10) Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie valid and such appointment satisfies the Court exercising jurisdiction under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration Act, acceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar the jurisdiction under Section 11(6) cannot be countenanced in law.	Reasoning
33.	Reasoning
We may immediately state that the opinion expressed in the aforesaid case is in consonance with the binding authorities we have referred to hereinbefore.	Reasoning
In TRF Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377 , the Managing Director of the respondent had nominated a former Judge of this Court as sole arbitrator in terms of aforesaid Clause 33(d), after which the appellant had preferred an application under Section 11(5) read with Section 11(6) of the Act.	Reasoning
The plea was rejected by the High Court and the appeal therefrom on the issue whether the Managing Director could nominate an arbitrator was decided in favour of the appellant as stated hereinabove.	Reasoning
As regards the issue about fresh appointment, this Court remanded the matter to the High Court for fresh consideration as is discernible from para 55 of the Judgment.	Reasoning
In the light of these authorities there is no hindrance in entertaining the instant application preferred by the Applicants.	Reasoning
It is also clear from the Clause in the instant case that no special qualifications such as expertise in any technical field are required of an arbitrator.	Reasoning
This was fairly accepted by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent.	Reasoning
In the aforesaid circumstances, in our view a case is made out to entertain the instant application preferred by the Applicants.	Reasoning
We, therefore, accept the application, annul the effect of the letter dated 30.07.2019 issued by the respondent and of the appointment of the arbitrator.	Decision
In exercise of the power conferred by Section 11(6) of the Act, we appoint Dr. Justice A.K.

We must place on record that not even a suggestion in that respect was made by the learned counsel for the Applicants.	Decision
The matter was argued and has been considered purely from the legal perspective as discussed hereinabove.	Decision
This application is allowed in aforesaid terms.	None
