Shri F.K. Sherwani initially pressed for appointing an Arbitrator from outside RSIC.	None
His apprehension was that the CMD will not be an independent Arbitrator since he is likely to take interest of the RSIC into consideration.	None
This would be more so due to the financial difficulties being faced by the Corporation.	None
It was explained to Shri Sherwani that the agreement signed in principle provides for arbitration by the Chairman or MD of the Corporation or his nominee and also it was at the joint request of both the parties that the arbitration was taken away from the earlier Arbitrator.	None

Shri Sherwani also has given his consent that CMD may arbitrate.	None
The next date of hearing is fixed for 29.04.2010 at 3.00 PM.	None
As seen from the order dated 21.10.2010, the respondent submitted that they do not want to prolong the matter further and they have full faith in the present sole arbitrator and that they would like the sole arbitrator to decide the case and pass an award on the basis of material available on record at the earliest.	None
As stated earlier, to that effect, Shri Ram B. Salve, sole proprietor of the respondent had also given a letter dated 21.10.2010.	None
Since the papers were missing or incomplete, in the presence of both the parties, the arbitral tribunal vide its order dated 17.08.2011 has decided that the chronological events need to be ascertained and reconstruction will be required and a detailed order will be passed informing both the parties in this regard.	None
As seen from the proceedings of the arbitral tribunal till that time, the respondent voluntarily participated and acquiesced in the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal and also expressed faith in the sole arbitrator.	None
Having thus voluntarily participated in the arbitral proceedings, the respondent has sent a legal notice dated 07.02.2013 to the appellantCorporation stating that in the arbitral proceedings, the respondent mutually agreed to the claim and the matter was settled for a sum of Rs.3,90,81,602/ and that in spite of repeated requests, the amount was not paid to the respondent.	Facts
The respondent also sent another legal notice dated 07.03.2013 reiterating its demand for payment of Rs.3,90,81,602/. To that effect, the appellant Corporation has sent a detailed reply dated 19.03.2013.	None
It is in this backdrop, the respondent has filed the arbitration petition before the High Court under Section 11 and Section 15 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 on 13.05.2015 seeking appointment of an independent arbitrator.	Reasoning
As noted earlier, as per Clause 4.20.1 of Schedule4 (General Conditions), the parties have agreed that all disputes and differences arising out of or in any way concerning the contract, shall be referred to the Managing Director himself or his nominees for the sole arbitration and that there will be no objection to any such appointment on the ground that the person so appointed is an employee of the Corporation and that he has dealt with the matter to which the contract relates.	Reasoning
When the parties have consciously agreed that the disputes or differences shall be referred to the Managing Director himself or his nominee for sole arbitration and having participated in the arbitral proceedings before arbitrator for quite some time, the respondent cannot turn round and seek for appointment of an independent arbitrator.21.	Reasoning
The respondent having participated in the proceedings before the arbitral tribunal for quite some time and also having expressed faith in the sole arbitrator, is not justified in challenging the appointment of the Managing Director of the appellantCorporation as the sole arbitrator.	Reasoning
In Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Others v. Raja Transport Private Limited (2009) 8 SCC 520 , this Court held as under The fact that the named arbitrator is an employee of one of the parties is not ipso facto a ground to raise a presumption of bias or partiality or lack of independence on his part.	None
There can however be a justifiable apprehension about the independence or impartiality of an employee arbitrator, if such person was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate (as contrasted from an officer of an inferior rank in some other Department) to the officer whose decision is the subjectmatter of the dispute.	None
While considering the question whether the arbitral procedure prescribed in the agreement for reference to a named arbitrator, can be ignored, it is also necessary to keep in view clause (v) of subsection (2) of Section 34 of the Act which provides that an arbitral award may be set aside by the court if the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties (unless such agreement was in conflict with any provision of Part I of the Act from which parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with the provisions of Part I of the Act).	None
The legislative intent is that the parties should abide by the terms of the arbitration agreement.	None
underlining added The respondent has not placed any material to show that it has reason to believe that the arbitrator had not acted independently or impartially.	None
The respondent has not brought on record any material to entertain an apprehension that the Managing Director of the appellantCorporation is not likely to act independently or impartially.	Reasoning
On the other hand, as noted earlier, as per the proceeding of the arbitral tribunal dated 21.10.2010, the respondent had expressed its full faith in the sole arbitrator and had also given a letter dated 21.10.2010 to that effect.	Reasoning
The fact that the sole arbitrator is the Managing Director of the appellantCorporation is not a ground to raise a presumption of bias or lack of independence on his part.	Reasoning
The arbitration Clause 4.20.1 of Schedule4 (General Conditions) stipulates a high official i.e.  Managing Director of the Corporation not connected with the contract or the work executed by the respondent.	Reasoning
Having participated in the entire arbitration proceedings and acquiesced in the proceedings, the respondent is estopped from challenging the competence of the arbitrator.	Reasoning
The respondent was not justified in filing the arbitration petition seeking appointment of an independent arbitrator.	None
Whether by virtue of Section 12 of the Amendment Act, the Managing Director has become ineligible to act After the amendment to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 2015, Section 12(5) prohibits the employee of one of the parties from being an arbitrator.	None
In the present case, the agreement between the parties was entered into on 28.01.2000 and the arbitration proceedings commenced way back in 2009 and thus, the respondent cannot invoke Section 12(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015.	Reasoning
As per Section 26 of the Act, the provisions of the amended Act 2015 shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of Section 21 of the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree.24.	Reasoning
In Board of Control for Cricket in India v. Kochi Cricket Private Limited and others, (2018) 6 SCC 287 , this Court held that the provisions of Amendment Act, 2015 (with effect from 23.10.2015) cannot have retrospective operation in the arbitral proceedings already commenced unless the parties otherwise agree.	Reasoning
In the present case, there is nothing to suggest that the parties have agreed that the provisions of the new Act shall apply in relation to the arbitral proceedings.25.	Reasoning
Contending that the sole arbitrator ChairmancumManaging Director, by virtue of 2015 amendment, has become ineligible to act as the arbitrator, the learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance upon TRF Limited v. Energo Engineering Projects Limited (2017) 8 SCC 377.	Reasoning
In the said case, though the agreement purchase order was dated 10.05.2014 (prior to the amendment), notice invoking arbitration was issued on 28.12.2015 (after the Amendment Act 2015) and the letter of the Managing Director nominating the arbitrator is dated 27.01.2016.	Reasoning
In such factual matrix of the case, this Court has held that the named arbitratorManaging Director of the respondent therein had become ineligible by operation of law and therefore, he cannot nominate another person as an arbitrator.	Reasoning
In para (54), it was held as under In such a context, the fulcrum of the controversy would be, can an ineligible arbitrator, like the Managing Director, nominate an arbitrator, who may be otherwise eligible and a respectable person.	None
As stated earlier, we are neither concerned with the objectivity nor the individual respectability.	None
We are only concerned with the authority or the power of the Managing Director.	None
By our analysis, we are obligated to arrive at the conclusion that once the arbitrator has become ineligible by operation of law, he cannot nominate another as an arbitrator.	None
The arbitrator becomes ineligible as per prescription contained in Section 12(5) of the Act.	None
It is inconceivable in law that person who is statutorily ineligible can nominate a person.	None
Needless to say, once the infrastructure collapses, the superstructure is bound to collapse.	None
One cannot have a building without the plinth.	None
Or to put it differently, once the identity of the Managing Director as the sole arbitrator is lost, the power to nominate someone else as an arbitrator is obliterated.	None
Therefore, the view expressed by the High Court is not sustainable and we say so.	None
underlining added The facts of the said case are entirely different from the case in hand.	Reasoning
In the said case, when notice invoking arbitration was issued on 28.12.2015, after the Amendment Act, 2015 came into force with effect from 23.10.2015, by virtue of which the person named in the agreement became ineligible to act as the arbitrator.	Reasoning
In the case in hand, the arbitration proceedings started way back in 2009 long before 2015 Amendment Act came into force and therefore, 2015 Amendment Act is not applicable to the case in hand.	Reasoning
The statutory provisions that would govern the matter are those which were then in force before the Amendment Act.27.	Reasoning
To fortify our view, we can usefully refer to the decision of this Court in Aravali Power Company Private Limited v. Era Infra Engineering Limited (2017) 15 SCC 32.	Reasoning
In this case, the invocation of arbitration was on 29.07.2015 and the arbitrator was appointed on 19.08.2015 and the parties appeared before the arbitrator on 07.10.2015 well before 23.10.2015 i.e. date on which the Amendment Act was deemed to have come into force.	Reasoning
It was held that the statutory provisions that would therefore govern the controversy are those that were in force before the Amendment Act came into effect.	Reasoning
This Court has therefore directed that the arbitration, in pursuance of the appointment of the arbitrator on 19.08.2015, shall proceed in accordance with law.	Reasoning
Whether the High Court was right in terminating the mandate of the arbitrator appointed as per the agreement The main question falling for consideration is whether the High Court was right in terminating the mandate of the arbitrator appointed as per the agreement and appointing a substitute arbitrator in the application filed under Section 11(6) and Section 15 of the Arbitration Act.	Reasoning
As pointed out earlier, the proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal proceeded till 17.08.2011 and thereafter, no progress was made.	Reasoning
The respondent issued legal notice on 07.02.2013 calling upon the appellant to pay Rs.3.90,81,602/ alleging that the said amount was settled during the course of proceedings before the Arbitral Tribunal.	Reasoning
Reiterating the demand, the respondent has again sent the legal notice on 07.03.2013.	Reasoning
However, no award came to be passed.	Reasoning
The respondent filed application under Sections 11 and 15 of the Act of 1996 on 13.05.2015 seeking appointment of an independent arbitrator for adjudication of the disputes and differences between the appellant and the respondent.29.	Facts
In support of his contention, the learned counsel for the respondent relied upon the decision in Union of India and others v. Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation Limited (2015) 2 SCC 52.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel for the respondent contended that the arbitrator failed to conclude the proceedings even after four years and the High Court rightly appointed the substitute arbitrator departing from the arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties.	Reasoning
In the said case, since the Arbitral Tribunal did not pass award in spite of expiry of four years, the respondent thereon filed Request Case No.10/2010 and the High Court passed order dated 09.03.2011 giving the last chance to the Arbitral Tribunal to complete the arbitral proceedings within a period of three months.	Reasoning
In para (6) of the judgment, this Court pointed out that the High Court took note of the various dates and hearings that are fixed by the Tribunal between 25.03.2011 and 25.06.2011 and came to the conclusion that the delay caused in the arbitral proceedings was intentional.	Reasoning
After referring to Union of India v. Singh Builders Syndicate (2009) 4 SCC 523 and other judgments, this Court observed that the delays and frequent changes in the Arbitral Tribunal defeat the process of arbitration and therefore, the appointment of the arbitrator by the court of its own choice departing from the arbitration clause has become an acceptable proposition of law which can be termed as a legal principle which has come to be established by a series of judgments of this Court.	Reasoning
Having regard to the facts of the said case, observing that the delay in arbitral proceedings was intentional, in para (6) of Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation Limited, it was held as under The High Court took note of the various dates of hearings that are fixed by the Tribunal between 2532011 and 2562011 and came to the conclusion that delay caused in the arbitral proceedings was intentional.	None
So much so, the members of the Arbitral Tribunal were continuing their dilatory tactics in deciding the matter before it since 2007 and four years had passed in the process.	None
The Tribunal had faltered even after giving specific directions to conclude the matter within three months and long adjournments were granted thereby violating the specific directions of the High Court.	None
Terming this attitude of the members of the Tribunal as negligent on their part towards their duties with no sanctity for any law or for the orders of the High Court, the High Court allowed the petition of the respondent herein and set aside the mandate of the Tribunal with the appointment of sole arbitrator by the Court itself.	None
Having regard to the factual matrix of the present case, in our considered view, the ratio of the said decision cannot be applied to the case in hand.	Reasoning
Per contra, in the present case, the proceedings of the arbitral tribunal continued till 17.08.2011.	Reasoning
From the proceeding of the arbitral tribunal dated 17.08.2011, it is seen that the arbitrator observed that the file regarding arbitration appears tampered missing papers are incomplete and therefore, the chronological events need to be ascertained and reconstitution will be required.	Reasoning
It is in this background, the award was not passed till 2013.	None

After analysis of the scheme of Sections 11, 14 and 15, in S.B.P. and Company v. Patel Engineering Limited and Another (2009) 10 SCC 293 , this Court held that the legislature has repeatedly laid emphasis on the necessity of adherence to the terms of agreement between the parties in the matter of appointment of arbitrators and procedure to be followed for such appointment.

None
At that stage, the petitioner thereon filed an application under Section 11(5) read with Section 15(2) of the Act praying for appointment of a substitute arbitrator to resolve the disputes between the parties.	None
The said application was dismissed by the Chief Justice holding that Section 15(2) refers not only to the statutory rules framed for regulating the appointment of arbitrators but also to contractual provisions for such appointment upholding the view taken by the Chief Justice.	None
In para (4), it was held as under The withdrawal of an arbitrator from the office for any reason is within the purview of Section 15(1)(a) of the Act.	None

Therefore, what Section 15(2) contemplates is an appointment of the substituted arbitrator or the replacing of the arbitrator by another according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the original arbitrator who was being replaced.	None
The term rules in Section 15(2) obviously referred to the provision for appointment contained in the arbitration agreement or any rules of any institution under which the disputes were referred to arbitration.	None
There was no failure on the part of the party concerned as per the arbitration agreement, to fulfil his obligation in terms of Section 11 of the Act so as to attract the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice under Section 11(6) of the Act for appointing a substitute arbitrator.	None
Obviously, Section 11(6) of the Act has application only when a party or the person concerned had failed to act in terms of the arbitration agreement.	None
When Section 15(2) says that a substitute arbitrator can be appointed according to the rules that were applicable for the appointment of the arbitrator originally, it is not confined to an appointment under any statutory rule or rule framed under the Act or under the scheme.	None
It only means that the appointment of the substitute arbitrator must be done according to the original agreement or provision applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator at the initial stage.underlining added As held in Yashwith Constructions, Section 11(6) of the Act would come into play only when there was failure on the part of the party concerned to appoint an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement.
