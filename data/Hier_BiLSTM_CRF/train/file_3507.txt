Repeal and savings  As from the dates of the actual enforcement of the Acts specified in section 2 of this Act the corresponding laws in force in Vindhya Pradesh immediately before the said dates shall be deemed to have been repealed without prejudice to anything done or suffered thereunder or any right, privilege, obligation or liability, acquire , accrued or incurred thereunder before the aforesaid dates.

7. Section 2 of the Central Provinces end Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 which was extended to Vindhya Pradesh, defined contract to mean any agreement for the carrying out for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration, the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of any building, road bridge or other immovable property, and, further defined goods to mean all kinds of property including all materials, articles and commodities, whether or not to be used in the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of immovable property, and finally defined sale as including a transfer of property in goods made in the course of the execution of a contract.	None
By these definitions the materials used or supplied by a building contractor in the construction of buildings, roads, bridges etc. were made liable to sales tax in accordance with a schedule of rates, to which reference seems unnecessary. 8.	None
The legality of these and similar provisions of law purporting to impose sales tax on building materials in State Acts came up for consideration before High Courts in India, and two welldefined views were expressed, one holding that the power to disentangle in a building contract the sale of materials from the execution of works with a view to taxing such a sale, was not beyond the legislative power of the States acting under Entry 48, List II, Seventh Schedule of the Government of India Act 1935 corresponding to Entry 54 of the like List in the Constitution.	None
It was held in those cases that a building contract, though entire, involved labour plus materials and in respect of the materials there was a sale involving transfer of property for consideration, and that the legislature had the power to frame a definition of sale to separate the two.	None
The other view was that building contracts were entire, and that there was no sale of goods as contemplated by the Indian Sale of Goods Act, which was the sense in which the Entry was framed, a sense which had a wellrecognised legal import.	None
This Court in Gannon Dunkeleys case 1959 SCR 379 (AIR 1958 SC 560) approved the latter view, which is found in the decision of the Madras High Court in sub nom Gannon Dunkerley v. State of Madras 19545 STC 216 (AIR 1954 Mad l130), and disapproved the contrary view.	None
It was pointed out that though in a popular sense there was a sale of the materials, there was none in the sense in which the expression sale of goods is used in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, since there was no agreement to sell or sale of materials as such, nor did the property pass therein as movables.	None
In Banarsi Dass case 1959 SCR 427 (AIR 1958 SC 909 ), which was a case from the State of Madhya Pradesh and which was heard simultaneously, it was held that if the parties entered into distinct and separate contracts, one for transfer of materials for money consideration and the other, for payment of remuneration for services or works done, then there was a sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act and the levy of tax was valid but that if the contract was an entire one, the levy was without competence.	None
The sections of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act making such a division and taxing the socalled sales of materials were declared to be beyond the powers of the State Legislature.	None
9.	None
The petitioner contends that the impugned sections of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, as applied to Vindhya Pradesh, fell within these two rulings, and must also be declared ultra vires the Vindhya Pradesh State Legislature, when the latter enacted the Vindhya Pradesh Laws (Validating) Act, 1952.10.	Arguments of Petitioner
As against this, the respondents contend that the Notification S. R. O. No. 6, which added S. 29 repealing the Vindhya Pradesh Sales Tax Ordinance 2 of 1949, the Part C States (Miscellaneous Laws) Repealing Act, 1951 and the Vindhya Pradesh Laws (Validating) Act, 1952 all concurred in repealing Ordinance 2 of 1949 from December 24, 1950, but left intact the operation of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act as extended to Vindhya Pradesh by S. R. O. No. 6 of1950.	Arguments of Respondent
The Vindhya Pradesh Laws (Validating) Act, 1952 merely removed the doubts by stating again that the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act had been and shall be deemed to be in force in Vindhya Pradesh from April 1, 1951, but did not reenact that Act.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the respondents, the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act was in force in Vindhya Pradesh as a result of its extension by Notification S. R. O. 6 and Notification No. 52 (Econ), the repeal of Ordinance 2 of 1949 being achieved by the Part C States (Miscellaneous Laws) Repealing Act, 1951 from December 29, 1950.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents, therefore, seek to uphold the impugned provisions on the basis of the ruling of this Court in Mithan Lals case, 1959 SCR 445 (AIR 1958 SC 682 ), where it was pointed out that whatever might be said of the State Legislatures operating under List II did not hold good in the case of Parliament, which derived its powers in relation to legislation in Part C States, not only from all the Lists but also from the residuary powers of taxation mentioned in Art.	Arguments of Respondent
248(2).	None
It was also held that S. 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950 was not repugnant to Art.	None
248(2), that the extended law, became incorporated by reference in the Part C States (Laws) Act, and that the tax was thus one imposed by Parliament itself.	None
The respondents, therefore, contend that, as held in Mithan Lals case, 1959 SCR 445 (AIR 1958 SC 682 ), when Parliament enacted the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950 and conferred power on the Central Government to extend any Act of a Part A State to any Part C State, that power of extension carried with it the plenary powers of Parliament, and even though the law so extended might have been outside the competence of the State Legislature which enacted it, when extended under the authority of Parliament was a valid piece of law in a Part C State.	None
11.	None
The arrival contentions may be reduced to the proposition that if the State Legislature of Vindhya Pradesh extended the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, then the extended Act would suffer from the disability pointed out in Gannon Dunkerleys case, 1959 SCR 379 (AIR 1958 SC 560 ) but if the Central Provinces and Berar Act was extended by the Notification under the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950, then it must be treated as incorporated in that Act and to have the authority of Parliament which, in relation to Part C States, had no limitations whatever.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have, therefore, to see whether the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 can be said to have been extended for the first time by the Vindhya Pradesh Legislature in 1952 when it passed the Vindhya Pradesh Laws (Validating) Act, 1952 to the exclusion off the order contained in the Notification No. S. R. O. 6, or whether the Act continued to be in force in Vindhya Pradesh even before and all that the Vindhya Pradesh Act did was to remove any doubts about its validity.	Issue
12.	None
The contention on behalf of the petitioner is that the Notification dated December 29, 1950 was invalid in its latter part, as decided by this Court in the Delhi Laws Act case, 1951 SCR 747 (AIR 1951 SC 332 ).	None
That portion dealt with the repeal of Ordinance 2 of 1949, and if the Notification was invalid in that part, then the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, which was extended by the opening part, never came into force.	None
Mr. Viswanatha Sastri contended that the Notification must be looked at compendiously, and that it was impossible to think that the Central Government would have extended the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, if the earlier Ordinance still continued to operate.	None
He relied in this connection upon the observations of this Court in Pesikakas case (Behram Khurshid Pesikaka v. State of Bombay, 19551 SCR 613 at p. 638((S) AIR 1955 SC 123 at p. 139) to urge that the Notification, which was beyond the powers of the Central Government in its latter part, must be regarded as a nullity, and contended that if the invalid portion of the Notification was fundamental to the operation of the valid portion, then the valid portion also must equally fail because it could not have been intended that two laws on the same topic were to operate simultaneously in Vindhya Pradesh.	None
According to him, the extension of the Central Provinces and Berar Act could not and would not have been made, if the Ordinance had not been first repealed.	None
Section 29 which was added, though composed of two parts, was, according to him, really a part of a single scheme and the repeal of the Ordinance and the extension of the Central provinces and Berar Act could stand or fall together, and since the Ordinance was never validly repealed, it continued to operate in Vindhya Pradesh till its repeal on October 31, 1951 by the Part C States (Miscellaneous Laws) Repealing Act, 1951, and when the Act repealed it from December 29, 1950 the effect was that there was no sales tax law in operation in Vindhya Pradesh because the Part C States (Miscellaneous Laws) Repealing Act, 1951, did not enact or extend any law on the subject of sales tax in or to Vindhya Pradesh.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him till the enactment of the Vindhya Pradesh Laws (Validating) Act 6 of 1952 on January 8, 1953 there was no law imposing sales tax in Vindhya Pradesh, and the law was then made by the Legislature of Vindhya Pradesh by extending the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act from April, 1, 1951.	Reasoning
He, therefore, contended that since the powers of the Vindhya Pradesh Legislature did not include the power of imposing sales tax on building materials, this Act of the Vindhya Pradesh Legislature if it sought to impose sales tax our building materials, fell within the ruling in Gannon Dunkerleys case 1959 SCR 379 (AIR 1958 SC 560 ) and must be declared as of no effect.	Arguments of Petitioner
He also referred to Act 9 of 1953 passed by the Vindhya Pradesh State Legislature, by which the Act was further amended, and stated that the extended Act, as amended, owed its existence neither to Parliament nor to the Central Government acting under the Part C States (Laws) Act but to the Vindhya Pradesh Laws (Validating Act 1952 (6 of 1952) and the Vindhya Pradesh Amendment Act, 1953 (9 of 1953).	None
13.	Reasoning
There is a fundamental fallacy involved in this reasoning.	Reasoning
We are considering the applicability of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act as extended to Vindhya Pradesh.	Reasoning
The Vindhya Pradesh Amending Act made only verbal changes, but did not alter the structure of the tax.	Reasoning
No doubt that Act contained certain provisions under which sale of building materials are taxable and if the authority to tax the socalled sales emanated from a stale Legislature, then the law would fail.	Reasoning
But we have to remember, in this connection, that the law was first extended to Vindhya Pradesh by the Central Government acting under the authority of Parliament legislating for a Part C State.	Reasoning
Parliament and the Central Government were not subject to the disabilities pointed out in Gannon Dunkerleys case, 1959 SCR 379 (AIR 1958 SC 560 ), and the matter was covered by the decision of this Court in Mithan Lals case, 1959 SCR 445 (AIR 1958 SC 682 ).Even	Reasoning
if the Notification, S. R. O. No. 6 failed to repeal Ordinance 2 of 1949, Parliament by its own law effaced that Ordinance in Vindhya Pradesh from December 29 1950, and enacted that the Ordinance shall be deemed to be repealed from that day.	Reasoning
After the passing of the Repealing Act by Parliament, it is impossible to argue that Ordinance 2 of 1949 continued in Vindhya Pradesh down to January 8, 1953 because by fiction the Ordinance was repelled from December 29, 1950.	Reasoning
Parliamentary legislation, therefore, came to the rescue so to speak, of the Notification by making room for the extension of the Central Provinces and Berar Act by repealing Ordinance 2 of 1949 which the Notification proprio vigore was unable to achieve, as laid down in the Delhi Laws Act case, 1951 SCR 747 (AIR 1951 SC 332 ).	Reasoning
The Notification of the central Governments (S.R.O. No. 6) and Act 66 of 1951 therefore, concurred in removing the Ordinance on December 29, 1950 and in extending the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act in its place on the same date.	Reasoning
14.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Viswanatha Sastri argued, on the strength of the ruling of this Court in Deepchand v. state of Uttar Pradesh, 1959 Sup (2) SCR 8 at p. 24 (AIR 1959 SC 648 at p. 657) that the validity, of a law must be judged as on the date on which it was passed, and if the law was invalid on that date, then the law must be deemed not to have existed at all, unless it was later reenacted.	Arguments of Petitioner
The passage relied upon is as followsThe validity of a statute is to be lasted by the constitutional power of a legislature at the time of its enactment by that legislature, and, if thus rested, it is beyond the legislative power, it is not rendered valid without reenactment if later, by constitutional amendment, the necessary legislative power is granted.	None
An after acquired power cannot, ex proprio vigore, validate a statute void when enacted.	None
(p. 24).	None
This argument would be applicable if we were to consider that Notification	None
No. S.R.O. 6 in isolation, and the question was one of validation of that Notification.	None
The Notification is being questioned, because it sought to repeal Ordinance 2 of 1949, which it could not do.	None
But, today we are not in a position to say that ordinance 2 of 1949 continued in Vindhya Pradesh, because Parliament by the Part C States (Miscellaneous Laws) Repealing Act, 1951 has enacted that the said Ordinance must be deemed to have been repealed from December 11, 1950.	Reasoning
Indeed, in the ruling of this Court at the same page are cited passages from Willoughby on Constitution of the United States (2nd Edn.), Vol. 1, p. 10 based on the decision in John M. Wilkerson v. Charles A. Rahrer, (1891)140 US 545 35 Law Ed 572 to the effect that if the cause of the unconstitutionality is removed their the law does not need to be reenacted.	None
The facts of this case are entirely different from those in Deepchands case, 1959 Sup (2) SCR 8 at P. 24 (AIR 1959 SC 648 at p. 657).The extended law did not depend on the repeal of the earlier law for its validity.	None
It would have been operative, even if the earlier law was not repealed but the earlier law was, in fact, repealed from December 20, 1950, and no question of conflict between the new and the old law ever arose.	Reasoning
Parliament by repealing the Ordinance rendered the ineffective portion of the Notification a mere surplusage.	Reasoning
The necessary result thus was that its operative part survived and the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 was validly extended to Vindhya Pradesh, and was valid law as laid down in Mithan Lals case, 1959 SCR 445 (AIR 1958 SC 682 ).	Reasoning
It did not suffer from the defects pointed out by this Court in Gannon Dunkerleys case, 1959 SCR 379 (AIR 1958 SC 560 ) as it was not enacted or extended by the State Legislature.	None
15.	Reasoning
It remains to consider the last argument on this point, and it is that the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act was reextended to Vindhya Pradesh by Act 6 of 1952, and thus owed its existence to a law made by a State Legislature which was incompetent to enact a law that building materials in a works contract, which was entire, were liable to sales tax.	None
The preamble of the Act shows that it was enacted to remove certain doubts which were entertained as to whether the extended Sales Tax Act became operative only from October 31, 1951 when Act 66 of 1951 was passed, or from an earlier date, viz.	None
April 1, 1951, from which date it was brought into force in Vindhya Pradesh by Notification No. 52 (Econ), dated March 20, 1951.	None
To remove these doubts, the Vindhya Pradesh Laws (Validating) Act, 1952, enacted with the assent of the President declared by S. 2 already quoted) that the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act had been and shall be deemed to be in force in Vindhya Pradesh from April 1, 1951.	Arguments of Respondent
This declaration do not extend proprio vigore the Central Provines and Berar Sales Tax Act, but only declared that it must be deemed to be validly in force from April 1, 1951, Section 7, on which much reliance has been placed, may be quoted again Repeal and savings  	None
As from the dates of the actual enforcement of the Acts specified in section 2 of this Act the corresponding laws in force in Vindhya Pradesh immediately before the said dates shall be deemed to have been repealed without prejudice to anything done or suffered thereunder or an right, privilege obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred thereunder before the aforesaid dates.	None
It is said that, if the two sections are read together, they mean that the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act was freshly extended from April 1, 1951 by the Vindhya Pradesh Act and any law made by any authority earlier was freshly repealed to make room for the extension.	None
This argument, in our opinion, is erroneous.	None
16.	None
To begin with, the powers of the Vindhya Pradesh Legislature were circumscribed by S. 22 of the Government of Part C States Act, 1951, quoted earlier.	None
Under that section, the powers of the State Legislatures, did not extend to making laws repugnant to any law made by Parliament.	None
The Explanation defines the expression law made by Parliament, and excludes a law which provides for the extension to the State of any law in force in any other part of the territory of India.	None
The Vindhya Pradesh, Legislature, however, did not repeal either S. 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act or the Notification, and all that the Legislature did, was to add its own authority, by a declaration, to the laws earlier extended.	None
The law was extended first by Notification S. R. O. No. 6 on December 29, 1950, but it was brought into force only by Notification No. 52 (Econ) dated March 20, 1950 from April 1, 1951.	None
The Notification, S. R. O. No. 6, had substituted for subsec.	None
(3) of S. 1 of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, the following (3) It shall come into force on such date as may be notified by the central Government in the Official Gazette.	None
Till the Notification No. 52 (Econ) was made the Act was extended but was not in force in Vindhya Pradesh.	None
There is a difference between the extension of a law subject to its being brought into force later and its coming into force on a later date.	None
Section 7 of Act 6 of 1952 repealed only the laws in force prior to the date on which the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act was brought into force.	None
It speaks of laws in force in Vindhya Pradesh immediately before April 1, 1951, and the law which was in force immediately before that date was not the Cental Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act which had not been brought into force, but might be Ordinance 2 of 1949, if it had not been successfully repealed earlier.	None
The former Act was extended on December 29, 1950, but was not brought into force till April 1, 1951, and the section speaks of laws in force.	None
The section, therefore, refers to Ordinance 2 of 1949, which would be in force immediately before April 1, 1951 if not successfully repealed, but not to the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, which was only extended before that date but had not been brought into force.	Reasoning
In other words, S. 7 of the Act does no more than repeal from April 1, 1951 (if repeal was at all necessary) Ordinance 2 of 1949, which might be supposed to have continued as law till October 31, 1951, when it was repealed by Act 66 of 1951.	Reasoning
In point of fact and also in law, it was really repealed from December 29, 1950 under the Repealing Act 66 of 1951.	Reasoning
The Vindhya Pradesh Act 6 of 1952 cannot, therefore, be said to have enacted for the first time that the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act shall come into force from April 1, 1951 in Vindhya Pradesh.	Reasoning
It only declared what was a legal fact even without this declaration.	Reasoning
Nor did the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax  Act owe its existence to Act 6 of 1952.	Reasoning
Act 6 of 1952 only declared what the result of the earlier laws was, and added the authority of the Vindhya Pradesh Legislature to remove doubts and to save the law from any attack on the ground that the wrong Legislature had repealed the Ordinance or extended the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act.	Reasoning
In our opinion, this argument cannot be accepted.	Reasoning
17.	None
One further argument was advanced to which we have not referred so far, and which may now be noticed.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is that after the reorganisation of the States, Madhya Pradesh has as many as four Sales Tax Acts.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended that a person belonging to the area of the former State of Madhya Pradesh is not liable to Sales tax on building materials in a works contract under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act because of the decision in Benarsi Dass case, 1959 SCR 427 (AIR 1958 SC 909 ), but another person living in the area forming part of the former Vindhya Pradesh is liable to sales tax under the same Act, as extended to Vindhya Pradesh.	Arguments of Petitioner
This, it is said, is patently contrary to the spirit of the equal protection clause in Art.	Arguments of Petitioner
14.	Arguments of Petitioner
18.	None
The laws in different portions of the new State of Madhya Pradesh were enacted by different Legislatures, and under S. 119 of the States Reorganisation Act, all laws in force are to continue until repealed or altered by the appropriate Legislature.	Reasoning
We have already held that the sales tax law in Vindhya Pradesh was validly enacted, and it brought its validity with it under S. 119 of the Stated Reorganisation Act, when it became a part of the State of Madhya Pradesh.	Reasoning
Thereafter, the different laws in different parts of Madhya Pradesh can be sustained on the ground that the differentiation arises from historical reasons, and a geographical classification based on historical reasons has been upheld by this Court in M. K. Prithi Rajji v. The State of Rajasthan, Civil Appeal No. 327 of 1956, D  2221960 (SC) and again in The State of Madhya Pradesh v. The Gwalior Sugar Co. Ltd., Civil Appeal Nos. 98 and 99 of 1957, D  30111960	Reasoning
(SC).The latter case is important because the sugarcane cess levied in the former Gwalior State but not in the rest of Madhya Bharat of which it formed a part, was challenged on the same ground as here, but was upheld as not affected by Art.	Reasoning
14.	Arguments of Petitioner
We, therefore, reject this argument.	Reasoning
