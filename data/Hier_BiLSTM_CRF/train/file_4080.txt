who on May 8, 1964 allowed the appeal of the State to the extent that the land in dispute belonged to the State but its possession would remain with the Company till a valid notice was given by the State.	Issue
In support of this appeal it was contended on behalf of the State of Punjab that the High Court was in error in holding that the first notice given by the Director of Industries to the provisional liquidators was not legally sufficient and the respondent no. 2 was not bound to give possession to the State unless a fresh notice was given.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our opinion the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant is well founded and must be accepted as correct.	Reasoning
In the first place it is obvious that the title to the land has already vested in the State Government under the third proviso to cl.	Reasoning
6(a) of the Agreement because of the order of winding up of the Company made by the High Court.	Reasoning
There is nothing in the agreement to suggest that the Company was entitled to be in possession of the property even after its title had vested in the State Government.	Reasoning
The 4th proviso only states that if the Company does not deliver possession within reasonable time and if any machinery, plant, buildings or structures remain on the land the title to these also will vest in the State Government if the Company does not remove the structures or the machinery within 24 months from date of the notice.	Reasoning
In the circumstances of the case we are of opinion that the respondents were given sufficient notice by the letter of the Director of Industries dated August 14, 1952.	Reasoning
That notice satisfies the requirements of the fourth proviso of cl.	Reasoning
6(a) of the Agreement and the State is entitled to take possession of the land and other properties located therein within two years from date of that notice.	Reasoning
It is necessary to state that according to P.W. 4 Jaswant Singh the buildings on the site are in an area of one bigha, the structure was pucca but temporary.	Reasoning
It is the admitted case that the machinery has been sold by auction more than seven years back and only grass grows on the land.	Reasoning
The evidence of Tarachand R. W. 1 also shows that a greater part of the land is barren and the machinery and other valuable properties had already been removed.	Reasoning
Counsel on behalf of respondent no. 2 prayed that some further time may be given before the State takes possession of the properties.	Arguments of Respondent
We consider that a further period of six months time will be sufficient.	Decision
For these reasons we hold that the order of the Division Bench May 8, 1964 should be modified and the respondents should be directed to hand over possession of the land in dispute to the State of Punjab within six months from this date.5.	Decision
We accordingly allow this appeal.	None
But there will be no order as to costs.	Decision
