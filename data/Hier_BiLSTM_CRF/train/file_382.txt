The respondent stated that after applying for a connection in 1996 for the grant of an electricity connection, the appellant did not submit a test report in spite of a public notice dated 7 July 2004.	Facts
This had resulted in delay, which was attributable to the appellant.	Facts

According to the respondent, after the receipt of the report, the work of issuing electricity bills was going on and a bill was issued to the appellant.	Facts

However, the appellant filed a review petition.	Facts
The Review Petition was allowed and a compensation of Rs 2,00,000 was awarded to the appellant.	Facts
Mr. Vinay Navare, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submits that this is a case where an agriculturist was left in the lurch for nearly nineteen years after the submission of an application for the grant of an electricity connection.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was urged that in the written statement, a false stand was taken by the respondent to the effect that the electricity connection had already been granted.	Arguments of Petitioner
The fact of the matter is that it was only when the High Court of Judicature at Bombay passed an order on 14 August 2015 in Criminal Writ Petition No. 247 of 2005 that the connection was granted on 4 September 2015.	Arguments of Petitioner
Hence, it was urged that a case for the grant of compensation was made out since the appellant was disabled from using his bore well in the absence of electricity.	Arguments of Petitioner
The purpose of having a bore well was defeated as a consequence of which the land of the appellant could not be irrigated.	Arguments of Petitioner
The damage which was sustained by the appellant, was in the submission, liable to be compensated.	Arguments of Petitioner
The award of Rs 2,00,000, it was urged, does not meet the requirement of fair compensation.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that it was the failure of the appellant to submit a test report for nearly eight years after the submission of the application that led to a delay in the grant of an electricity connection.	Arguments of Respondent
Reliance was placed on an undertaking alleged to have been issued by the appellant on 2 February 2007 to the effect that he had been granted a connection for the purposes of the bore well after the order of the District Forum (On this aspect, Mr. Navare, learned senior counsel has pointed out that the alleged undertaking has been produced for the first time before this Court in the counter affidavit and was not either pleaded or set up in the proceedings before the District Forum.)	Arguments of Respondent
The facts as they emerge from the record indicate that the appellant had initially applied for an electricity connection in December 1996.	Reasoning
The appellant, however, submitted a test report, which is a requirement for obtaining such a connection, only in March 2005.	Reasoning
Hence, the respondent cannot be faulted for the delay which occurred between the date of the submission of the application and until the appellant complied with the requirement of submitting a test report.	Reasoning
But the fact of the matter is that the test report was submitted on 24 March 2005.	None
There is no cogent explanation on the part of the respondent as to why a decade thereafter elapsed before the electricity connection was granted to the appellant.	None
As a matter of fact, a criminal complaint was lodged by the appellant.	None
Criminal Writ Petition No. 247/2015 was instituted by the Executive Engineer of the respondent.	None

In the light of statement of the learned Advocate appearing for the petitioners, the learned counsel appearing for Respondent No. 1, on instructions of Respondent No. 1, submits that, the Respondent No. 1 has no objection, if the Petition is allowed and the proceedings in R.C.C. No. 4/2015 pending on the file of J.M.F.C. Shahada are quashed and set aside along with Crime No. 1/2015 under Sections 166, 167, 384, 420, 465, 468, 471, 477A and 34 of I.P.C. r w Section 66D of Information Technology Act, 2002 registered with Sarangkheda Police Station, Dist.

In the light of above, the proceedings in R.C.C. No. 4/2015 pending on the file of J.M.F.C. Shahada and Crime No. 1/2015 under Sections 166, 167, 384, 420, 465, 468, 471, 477A and 34 of I.P.C. r w Section 66D of Information Technology Act, 2002 registered with Sarangkheda Police Station, Dist.	None
Nandurbar are quashed and set aside.	None
The Petition stands allowed in above terms.?	None
The above order indicates that a statement was made on behalf of the respondents that a new meter with electricity supply will be provided to the agricultural field of the appellant on 5 September 2015.	Reasoning
Such an exercise was carried out on 4 September 2015.	Reasoning
In this background, we are of the view that the appellant has suffered hardship and inconvenience as a result of an unexplained delay of one decade on the part of the respondent(s) in granting an electricity connection.	Reasoning
After the submission of the test report, no further steps were required to be carried out by the appellant.	Reasoning
The appellant evidently required an electricity connection for the purpose of activating the bore well for supplying water to his agricultural fields.	Reasoning
In our view, having regard to the above facts and circumstances of the case, the grant of compensation by the NCDRC in the amount of Rs 2,00,000 will not be adequate to meet the requirement of just and fair compensation to a consumer who has suffered as a consequence of the default of the respondent.	Reasoning
We accordingly, enhance the compensation which has been awarded by the NCDRC to an amount of Rs 5,00,000 which shall be paid over within a period of four weeks from today.	Decision
In default, the compensation shall carry interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum.	Decision
The civil appeal is allowed in these terms.	Decision
No costs.	None
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.	Decision
