Thanking you, Yours faithfully Sd  Rajesh Gupta It would appear that by letter dated 3.4.1998, the Branch manager brought the objection of the respondent to the notice of the head office of the appellants Corporation.	None
In response to this communication the Branch Manager was informed by the head office of the appellants Corporation, by letter dated 7.4.1998 that clear cut passage rasta has been provided to the unit as per documents submitted by the defaulting unit at the time of availing loan.	Facts
Reference in this letter was also made to the Sale Deed, dated 8.9.1994, Mutation No.5172, Mutation No.9896, Search Report and sale deed, Rasta, wherein it is mentioned that there is an approach road to the factory site.	Facts
The Branch Manager was directed to satisfy the respondent with the aforesaid documents.	Facts
On 13.4.1998, the Branch Manager addressed a letter to the head office of the appellants Corporation clearly informing as follows However, the actual Rasta which is of 3 Karams and appeared in the papers particularly shown in the sale deed is not connected directly with the unit and to connect the Rasta with the Rasta of the revenue record party purchased some land where the movement of the vehicles is not possible at all.	Facts
In fact the letter further pointed out as follows It is further stated that the area mentioned in the map approved by the M.C. is 1130 sq. yd.	Facts
whereas the total area in the sale deed and is mortgaged to the Corporation is 1210 sq. yd.	Facts
It is also not out of place to mention that the land on which the office building is constructed is also not mortgaged to the Corporation and if that area is excluded the main gate of the factory will go behind from the existing place and then the unit will be stripped of independent Rasta.	Facts
In spite of the aforesaid factual position, the appellants Corporation issued the letter dated 18.5.1998 to the respondent advising him to deposit balance amount of 25 per cent of the bid amount within 15 days from the date of issue of the letter failing which the amount of the earnest money deposited would be forfeited without further notice.	Facts
The respondent, however, again raised the issue regarding the passage at the open house held by the appellants Corporation at Hissar on 12.6.1998.	Facts
According to the appellants Corporation, as per the revenue record and the demarcation report of the revenue officials dated 27.6.1998, therein 16.5 ft. rasta is provided in the west of the Unit.	Facts
However, not satisfied, the respondent did not pay the balance amount.	Facts
Therefore the appellants Corporation invited fresh tenders for sale of land.	Facts
On 30.9.1998 the appellants Corporation forfeited the sum of Rs.2.5 lakhs which had been deposited by the respondent as earnest money.	Facts
It was this action of the appellants Corporation that was challenged by the respondent by way of a Writ Petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.	Facts
The aforesaid writ petition has been allowed by the Division Bench.	Facts
The order dated 30.9.1998 by which the earnest money had been forfeited has been quashed and set aside.	Facts
A further direction has been issued to the appellants Corporation to refund the amount along with interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum w.e.f. 1.2.1998 to the date of payment.	Facts
The High Court also imposed costs on the appellants Corporation assessed as Rs.5,000/. Further directions were issued to release the amount to the respondent within two months from the receipt of a copy of the order of the High Court.	Facts
It is this order which is challenged in the present appeal.	Facts
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length.	None
Mr. Amit Dayal, learned counsel for the appellants Corporation submits that the respondent accepted the plots on as is where is basis.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the appellants Corporation cannot now permit the respondent to wriggle out of a confirmed bid, on the ground that there is no independent approach road to the Unit.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel further submitted that it was for the respondent to make necessary enquiry with regard to the existence of the 3 Karams rasta, with the Revenue and other authorities.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel the entire documentation which had been provided at the time when the loan was sanctioned clearly indicated that there is a 3 Karams rasta leading from the road to the Unit.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel further pointed out that the respondent had visited the site on 21.1.1998.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore he would have known the exact situation of the rasta.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondent was aware of the exact nature of the land being purchased by him.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of his submission learned counsel relies on Section 55 of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel further submitted that the appellants Corporation are entitled to forfeit the security amount in view of Clause 5 of the terms and conditions for the sale of property as contained in the advertisement dated 8.1.1998.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel also sought to justify the action of the appellants Corporation by placing reliance on Section 29 of The State Financial Corporation Act, 1951.	Arguments of Petitioner
12.	None
On the other hand, Mr. Vimal Chandra S. Dave, learned counsel for the respondent, submits that the judgment of the High Court is selfspeaking and is not open to challenge on any of the grounds pleaded by the appellants.	Arguments of Respondent
He submitted that the appellants cannot be permitted to take advantage of their own wrong.	Arguments of Respondent
They have misled the respondent into making a huge deposit for a plot of land which was not suitable.	Arguments of Respondent
Without an independent passage the land could not have been used as a manufacturing unit.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellants Corporation ignored all the objections raised by the respondent with regard to the nonexistence of the independent approach road.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel.	None
We have also perused the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court.	None
Factually the appellants have accepted that on 28.1.1998 the respondent had in no uncertain terms informed the appellants Corporation about the nonexistence of the independent passage.	None
No denial could possibly be made in the face of the letter dated 29.1.1998 which makes a reference to the visit of the respondent to the factory premises on 21.1.1998.	None
There is a categorical assertion that premises do not have an independent appropriate passage from the road.	None
When enquiries were made from the branch office, the respondent, was simply informed that copy of the site plan and building plan were not available, and would be available at the Head Office only.	None
Thereafter, there is a studious silence from the appellants Corporation with regard to the aforesaid grievance made by the respondent.	None
Again, on 7.3.1998 the respondent informed the appellants Corporation as follows In this regard, it is submitted that we have come to know that there is no approved authorised passage to factory sufficient to pass a truck through it.	None
The gate passage presently being used is unauthorized.	None
In the light of above you are requested to kindly apprise us in this matter and supply us the copy of approved building plan, site plan for the building mortgaged by H.F.C. so that we may not face any problem in future in running the unit.	None
It appears that the aforesaid request of the respondent was also never specifically answered by the appellants Corporation.	None
In view of the protests of the respondent, the issue was raised by the Branch Manager of the appellants Corporation through letter dated 3.4.1998 addressed to the Head Office.	Facts
The Branch Manager was informed by the Head Office, through letter dated 7.4.1998 that as per the documents submitted by the defaulting unit at the time of availing loan, clear cut passage rasta has been provided to the concerned Unit.	Facts
The letter dated 7.4.1998 reads as follows Please refer to your letter No. HFCBOJD987 dated 3.4.98 on the subject cited above.	None
In this connection, you are advised that clear cut Passage Rasta has been provided to the concern as per documents submitted by the concern at the time of availing loan.	None
Enclosed herewith please find photocopy of the Sale Deed No.1494 dated 8.9.94 and photocopy of the Mutation No.5172, another Mutation No.9896 and Search Report and Sale Deed, Rasta, wherein it is clear cut mentioned that there is an approach road the factory site.	Facts
So, you may please satisfy the Auction Purchaser with these documents and inform us the latest position of the case.	None
It is also added here that you may make clear to the auction purchaser that the unit has been sold by the Corporation as and where basis.	None
A perusal of the aforesaid letter makes it apparent that the appellants Corporation were merely relying on the documents submitted by M s. Unique Oxygen Private Limited, Old Hansi Road, Jind i.e., the defaulting unit.	None
The appellants Corporation had been informed by the management of the defaulting unit at the time of availing of the loan facility that the Unit had the necessary independent approach road.	None
The letter however does not indicate, that any independent inquiries were made by the appellants Corporation to verify the authenticity of the statements made by the management of the defaulting unit which had availed of the loan, by mortgaging the assets of the unit.	None
The entire issue seems to be concluded against the appellants Corporation by letter dated 30.4.1998, the relevant parts of which have already been reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment.	None
A perusal of the extracts, reproduced earlier, would clearly show that the Branch Manager has informed the head office in unequivocal language that the independent passage shown in the sale deed is not connected directly with the defaulting unit.	None
It also indicates that the defaulting unit had merely purchased some land to connect the rasta with the revenue record on which movement of the vehicle is not possible at all.	None
This land was not even mortgaged with the appellants Corporation.	None
The letter also clearly states that by exclusion of the aforesaid land the size of the plot would be reduced from 1210 sq. yards to 1130 sq. yards.	None
That would mean that the main gate of the factory would be out side the land offered for sale.	None
Taking into consideration the aforesaid facts the Division Bench concluded as follows Taking the totality of circumstances into consideration, we are satisfied that the petitioner was not at fault.	None
He was entitled to withhold the money as the respondents had failed to provide a proper passage.	None
Still further, the factual position having been admitted in the letter dated April 30, 1998, a copy of which is at Annexure P6, and nothing to the contrary having been produced on the file, we find that the action of the respondent Corporation in forfeiting the amount deposited by the petitioner was wholly arbitrary and unfair.	None
We see no reason to take any different view.	None
We are also of the opinion that the Division Bench was justified in further concluding that in law the appellants Corporation undoubtedly has the power to forfeit the earnest money provided there was a failure on the part of the respondent to make the deposit.	None
The Division Bench, however, observed that the respondent was dealing with an instrumentality of state.	None
He was entitled to legitimately proceed on the assumption that the appellants, a Statutory Corporation, an instrumentality of the State, shall act fairly.	None
The respondent could not have suspected that he would be called upon to pay the amount of Rs.50 lakhs without being given even a proper passage to the Unit that he was buying.	None
We are of considered opinion that the respondent had deposited the sum of Rs.2.5 lakhs on the clear understanding that there would be an independent approach road to the Unit.	None
This is understandable.	None
Without any independent passage the plot of land would be not more than an agricultural plot, not suitable for development as a manufacturing unit.	None
We therefore dont find any substance in the submission made by the learned counsel for the appellants Corporation.	None
In our opinion, the appellants cannot be given the benefit of Clause 5 of the advertisement.	Reasoning
The appellants Corporation cannot be permitted to take advantage of their own wrong.	Reasoning
Clause 5 undoubtedly permits the forfeiture of the earnest money deposited.	Reasoning
But this can only be, if the auction purchaser fails to comply with the conditions of sale.	Reasoning
In our opinion the respondent has not failed to comply with the conditions of sale.	Reasoning
Rather, it is the appellants Corporation which has acted unfairly, and is trying to take advantage of its own wrong.	Reasoning
In view of the aforesaid, we are of the considered opinion that the appellants Corporation cannot be permitted to rely upon Section 55 of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882.	Reasoning
The appellants Corporation failed to disclose to the respondent the material defect about the nonexistence of the independent 3 Karam passage to the property.	Reasoning
Therefore, the appellants Corporation clearly acted in breach of Section 55 (1) (a) and (b) of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882.	Reasoning
The aforesaid Section provides as under The seller is bound (a) to disclose to the buyer any material defect in the property or in the sellers title thereto of which the seller is, and the buyer is not, aware, and which the buyer could not with ordinary care discover (b) to produce to the buyer on his request for examination all documents of title relating to the property which are in the sellers possession or power A mere perusal of the aforesaid provision will show that it was incumbent upon the appellants Corporation to disclose to the respondent about the nonexistence of the independent passage to the Unit.	None
It was also the duty of the appellants Corporation to inform the respondent that the passage mentioned in the revenue record was not fit for movement of vehicles.	None
The appellant also failed to produce to the buyer the entire documentation as required by Section 51 (1) (b) of the aforesaid Section.	None
We are therefore satisfied that the appellants Corporation cannot seek to rely on the aforesaid provision of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882.	None
In our opinion, the reliance on Section 29 of the State Financial Corporations Act, 1951 is wholly misplaced.	Reasoning
The aforesaid Section pertains to action which the Corporation can take against the Unit which had defaulted in payment of loan.	Reasoning
In such circumstances the Corporation has the power to sell the property that has been hypothecated or mortgaged with the Corporation.	Reasoning
Respondent herein is an auction purchaser and therefore cannot be confused with the defaulting unit.	Reasoning
We are also of the considered opinion that the reliance placed on the judgment of this Court by the counsel for the appellants in the case of Union Bank of India vs. Official Liquidator and Ors.	Reasoning
(1994) 1 SCC 575 is wholly misconceived.	Reasoning
The aforesaid judgment relates to sale of the property and assets of a company in liquidation by the official liquidator under the orders of the Court.	Reasoning
Therefore it is observed that the official liquidator cannot and does not hold any guarantee or warranty in respect of the property sold.	Reasoning
That is because the official liquidator proceeds on the basis of what the records of the company in liquidation show.	Reasoning
Therefore it is for the intending purchaser to satisfy himself in all respects as to the title and encumbrances and so forth of the immovable property that he proposes to purchase.	Reasoning
In those circumstances it is held that the purchaser cannot after having purchased the property on such terms then claim diminution in the price on the ground of defect in the title or description of the property.	Reasoning
The judgment clearly goes on to further hold as follows The case of the Official Liquidator selling the property of a company in liquidation under the orders of the Court is altogether different from the case of an individual selling immovable property belonging to himself.	None
The aforesaid observation would be clearly applicable to the Corporation as it is exercising the rights of an owner in selling the property.	Reasoning
The appellants Corporation is not selling the property as an official liquidator.	Reasoning
In any event, the facts of this case as narrated above would clearly indicate that the respondent had made all necessary inquiries.	Reasoning
It was the appellants Corporation that failed to perform its obligations in giving a fair description of the property offered for sale.	Reasoning
Learned counsel had also relied on another judgment in the case of U.T. Chandigarh Administration and Anr.	Reasoning
vs. Amarjeet Singh and Ors.	Reasoning
(2009) 4 SCC 660.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the aforesaid judgment is wholly inapplicable to the facts and circumstances of this case as it relates to the duties of a developer who carries on activities of development of land and invites application for allotment of sites in a developed layout.	Reasoning
In our opinion the aforesaid judgment is not applicable to the facts of this case.	None
We see no merit in any of the submissions, or the grounds of appeal.	Decision
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.	Decision
It appears that the judgment of the High Court had been stayed by this Court on 2.9.2002.	Decision
In view of the dismissal of the appeal, we direct that the forfeited amount be refunded to the respondent with 12 per cent interest w.e.f. 1.2.1998 till payment.	Decision
The amount be paid to the respondent within a period of two months of producing the certificate copy of this order.	Decision
We also direct that in the event the aforesaid amount is not paid within the stipulated period the respondent shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 18 per cent per annum till payment.	Decision
We also direct the respondent shall be entitled to costs which are assessed as Rs.50,000/.	Decision
