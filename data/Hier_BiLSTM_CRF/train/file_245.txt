Summary of the compensation awarded by the Tribunal  table While calculating the loss of dependency at Rs. 3,52,620/, the Tribunal considered the income of the deceased at Rs. 3,918/ per month.	None
The age of the mother i.e. 42 years was considered, in order to apply the multiplier 15.	None
In addition, as the deceased was a bachelor, the Tribunal has reduced 50 of his salary in lieu of his personal expenses.	None
The High Court had enhanced the award to Rs.	None
5,02,610/.	None
The High Court while enhancing the compensation, did not consider the future prospects of the deceased.	Reasoning
The material on record makes it evident that the deceased was selfemployed.	Reasoning
The Constitution Bench of this Court in National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and Others (2017) 16 SCC 680 , has considered the issue in relation to future prospects, while granting the compensation.	Reasoning
It was held as under 59.4 In case the deceased was selfemployed or on a fixed salary, an addition of 40 of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years.	Reasoning
An addition of 25 where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10 where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation.	Reasoning
The established income means the income minus the tax component.	Reasoning
(emphasis supplied)	None
In the instant case, as the deceased was aged 19 years, an additional 40 of the established income must be added while computation of the compensation.	Reasoning
In addition, 50 of the said amount has to be deducted in lieu of his personal expenses, that he would have incurred to maintain himself as a bachelor, had he been alive.	Reasoning
Further, the High Court applied the multiplier at 15, as it took the age of the mother into consideration, and not that of the deceased.	Reasoning
A threeJudge Bench of this Court, in Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited v. Mandala Yadagari Goud and Others (2019) 5 SCC 554 , held that even if the deceased is a bachelor, his age has to be taken into account to adopt a multiplier.	Reasoning
The question for consideration in this case was as under The only legal issue canvassed before us in these matters, which are in the nature of crossappeals, is that in the case of a motor accident where there is death of a person, who is a bachelor, whether the age of the deceased or the age of the dependents would be taken into account for calculating the multiplier.	None
This question was answered in the following terms We are convinced that there is no need to once again take up this issue settled by the aforesaid judgments of threeJudge Benches and also relying upon the Constitution Bench that it is the age of the deceased which has to be taken into account and not the age of the dependents.	None
The Constitution Bench in Pranay Sethi (supra) has also awarded compensation under the conventional heads as under  59.8 Reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses should be Rs.15,000, Rs.40,000 and Rs.15,000 respectively.	Reasoning
The aforesaid amounts should be enhanced at the rate of 10 in every three years.	Reasoning
We are of the view that the High Court has rightly determined monthly salary of the deceased at Rs. 3,918.	Reasoning
In addition, 40 of the actual salary income of the deceased has to be added towards the future prospects of the deceased, as his age was less than 40 years.	Reasoning
Therefore, the gross income of the deceased must be calculated as Before Deducting the personal living expenses Rs. 3,918 (40 of the monthly income i.e Rs. 1567/) Rs. 5,485/	None
Since the deceased was a bachelor, 50 of his gross income must be deducted towards personal living expenses which must be calculated as Rs.5,485 (50 of 5485)	Reasoning
Rs. 2,743/	None
Thus, the compensation payable to the claimants towards loss of dependency is Rs.	Reasoning
5,92,488/(Rs.2,743 x 12 x 18 Rs. 5,92,488/).	Reasoning
In addition, the claimants are also entitled for a sum of Rs.70,000/ under the conventional heads.	Reasoning
Thus, the total compensation payable to the claimants comes to Rs. 6,62,448/.	None
The amount of Rs. 5,02,620/ awarded by the High Court, has to be deducted from the aforesaid amount, therefore, the balance compensation payable to the claimants comes to Rs. 1,59,868/, which is rounded off to Rs. 1,60,000/.	Reasoning
As a result, the appeal succeeds and is partly allowed.	Decision
The third respondent insurance company is directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 1,60,000/ with simple interest at the rate of 7 per annum from the date of the claim petition till the date of deposit.	Decision
The respondent insurance company is further directed to deposit the aforesaid amount before the Tribunal within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the copy of this judgment.	Decision
