All these Notifications issued by different Cantonment Boards were challenged before the Madhya Pradesh High Court by filling writ petitions were allowed by the impugned judgments of the High Court and it was held that the Cantonment Board has no power to levy entry tax on motor vehicles so long as the prohibit ions contained in section 6 of the Taxation Act continues and accordingly notifications issued by the Cantonment Board were quashed and thus the present appeals.	Facts
Mr. Lekhi, learned senior counsel appearing for the different cantonment Boards as well as Mr. Subba Rao, learned counsel appearing for some of the cantonment Boards challenged the correctness of the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court inter alia on the ground that the Municipalities Act being a later Act than the Taxation Act, the provisions of the later Act would prevail if there is any repugnancy between these two.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this view of the matter the imposition of entry tax having been provided for section 127 (iii) of the Municipalities Act, the same could be lawfully levied by the Cantonment Board under Section 60 of the Cantonment Act.	None
It was further contended that though the Municipalities Act did not expressly repeal the provisions of the Taxation Act but the same being a later Act the principles of implied repeal should be applied and therefore, any embargo contained in the Taxation Act for levy of entry tax because of section 6 of the Taxation Act will have no application.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also urged that the proviso to section 7 of the Taxation Act would indicate that the embargo contained in Section 6 of the said Act would apply only if the Cantonment Board agrees not to recover any tax and in the absence of any consent of the Cantonment Board the embargo contained in imposition of tax under Section 6 of the Taxation Act will not apply.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Lekhi, learned senior counsel also urged that the Taxation Act having not provided for any levy on the entry of Motor Vehicles as is provided under Section 127 (1)(ii) of the Municipalities Act there is infact no repugnancy between tow provisions and, therefore, so far as the levy of entry tax on motor vehicles is concerned, it must be held that the prohibitions contained in Section 6 of the Taxation Act w ill not get attracted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Lastly Mr. Lekhi argued that doctrine of desuetude should apply in the present case in as much as the provisions of section 7 of the Taxation Act though enacted since 1947 has not been in use so far and no grant has ever been given to the appellants cantonment Boards or for that matter to any other local authorities.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Agrawal, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents and Mr. S.K. Mehta, learned counsel appearing for some of the respondents on th e other hand contended that the statutory interpretation contained in the latin maxim leges posteriores priores conterarias abrogant is subject to the exception embodied in the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant.	Arguments of Respondent
in other words the theory that the later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws is subject to the exception that the general law does not derogate from a special one and applying the said principle the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act being a special Act dealing with levy of tax on Motor Vehicles the later law, namely, the Municipalities Act cannot be said to have repealed the earlier provisions of the Taxation Act and on the other hand it must be presumed that the situation was intended to continue to be dealt with by the specific provision contained in the Taxation Act rather than the later general provisions contained in the Municipalities Act and , therefore the High Court was fully justified in coming to the conclusion that the Cantonment board could not have issued the Notification levying tax on entry on Motor Vehicles.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned counsel also urged that the duty of the court being to put a construction by which both the provisions could be sustained, the expression vehicle in the Municipalities Act should be interpreted to mean all vehicles other than Motor Vehicles for which a special provision has been made in the Taxation Act and so construed the Cantonment Board would not have any jurisdiction to levy entry tax on Motor Vehicles.	Arguments of Respondent
The relevant Sections of the Madhya Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act may quoted hereunder Levy of Tax (2) The tax leviable under subsection (1) shall be paid by the owner of the motor vehicle used or kept of use (i) for a whole quarter at one fourth of the annual rate specified in the First Schedule , and for two or more whole quarters, pro rata or (ii) for any period expiring on the last day of quarter and not exceeding two months at onesixth or onetwelfth of the rate specified in the First Schedule, according as the period exceeds, or does not exceed one month.	None

Bar of imposition of tax by any local authority.(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment for the time being in force, no local authority shall, after the commencement of this Act, impose for enhance a tax, toll or licence fee in respect of a motor vehicle and if any local authority has imposed such tax.	None

(2) Nothing contained in sub section (10 shall affect the imposition, enhancement or recovery of an octroi tax levied hereafter by any local authority or a terminal tax levied and in force on the 1st January , 1937 within the local area under the jurisdiction of any local authority .	None

None
(2) Any sum payable under sub section (1) shall be charged on the Consolidated Fund of the State.	None
The rival submission require careful examination of different provisions of both the Acts and certain principles of interpretation of a statute.	None
The admitted position that emerges from the facts already narrated are that the cantonment Act, 1924 is the earliest in point of time which empowered the Cantonment Board to impose tax with the previous sanction of the Central Government which tax could be imposed in any Municipality in the State where such Cantonment is situated.	None
The Madhya Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1947 is a special provision dealing with levy of tax on motor Vehicle which is used or kept for use .	Reasoning
There is no provision in the aforesaid Taxation Act for levy of any tax on entry of Motor Vehicles alone.	Reasoning
The Municipality Act of 1961, however , authorises imposition of tax on vehicles, boats and animals entering the limits of the Municipality as provided in Section 127 91)(iii) of the said Act.	None
In the aforesaid premises it is required to be considered and decided as to whether the Cantonment Board could impose tax on vehicles entering the limits of the Cantonments which could have otherwise been levied by the Municipality in exercise of power under Section 127(1)(iii) of the Municipalities Act.	Issue
It may be further noticed that the Motor vehicles Taxation Act as well as the Municipalities Act are both enacted by the State Legislature.	None
The first question that arises for consideration is whether there is any repugnancy between the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act and the Municipalities Act in relation to imposition of tax on Motor Vehicles entering the limits of the Municipality.	None
As has been stated earlier under the Taxation Act, Tax could be imposed on the Motor Vehicles which is used or Kept for use as provided in Section 3(2) of the said Act and there is no provision for imposition of tax on vehicles which is neither used nor kept for use but for mere entry into any municipal limits .	Reasoning
When the legislatures imposed a ban on levy of tax by any local authority under section 6 of the Taxation Act what is prohibited is levy of tax which is leviable under section 3(2) of the Taxation Act.	Reasoning
When the same legislature enacted the Municipalities to impose tax on vehicles entering the limits of the Municipality under Section 127 (1)(iii) they must be presumed to be aware of the pro visions of the Taxation Act and leviability of the tax thereunder in respect of Motor Vehicles used or kept for use.	Reasoning
The expression vehicle having been defined in Section 2(38) to include a bicycle, a tricycle, motor car and ever wheel conveyance which is used or capable of being used on a public street, it is not possible for us to accept the contention of Mr. Agrawal, learned counsel appearing for the respondents to interpret the same expression to mean vehicles other than the motor vehicles.	Reasoning
Since the Taxation Act does not provide for any imposition of tax on entry of the Motor vehicles within Municipal limits whereas the municipal Act authorises for such levy under Section 127(1)(iii) we do not find any inconsistency or repugnancy between the two provisions.	Reasoning
In other words while under the Motor Vehicle Taxation Act a tax could be imposed on Motor Vehicles used or kept for use by the registering authority including the Municipalities under section 127(1)(iii) of the Municipalities Act.	Reasoning
But so far as the imposition of tax motor Vehicle entering into the Municipal limits is concerned, which is provided under section 127(1)(iii), of the Municipalities Act the said provisions cannot be said to be repugnant to the special statute in respect of Motor Vehicles, namely the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act.	Reasoning
It has been stated by this court in the case of Ashoka Marketing ltd.	Reasoning
And another etc. etc.	Reasoning
vs, Punjab National Bank and others etc. etc. that the principal of statutory interpretation, namely, later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws is subject to exception that a general provision does not derogate from a special one.	Reasoning
This would mean that where a literal meaning of the general enactment covers a situation for which specific provision is made by another enactment contained in the earlier Act, it is presumed that the situation was intended to be continued to be dealt with by the specific provision rather than the later general one.	Reasoning
in other words if the Taxation Act would have contained a provision authorising imposition of Entry Tax on Motor Vehicle than certainly the later general Act, namely the municipalities Act even if by making a provision of imposition of entry tax on Vehicles entering in to the Municipal limits would not have operated.	Reasoning
But since the special law, namely, the Taxation Act does not have any provision authorising imposition of tax on entry of Motor Vehicles.	Reasoning
The said provision would remain valid and would be applicable and there would be no bar for the municipality to impose entry tax on all vehicles including Motor Vehicles including Motor Vehicles for entering in to the limits of the Municipalities.	Reasoning
This Construction being the only harmonious construction by which both the provisions remain operative it is the duty of the court adopt such construction.	Reasoning
There is no dispute with the proposition advanced by Mr .	Reasoning
Lekhi, learned senior counsel with regard to theory of implied repeal.	Reasoning
This theory the learned the senior counsel advanced since the Municipalities Act did not repeal the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act.	None
It was held by this Court in the Case of Yogender Pal Singh others vs. Union of India Ors.	None
It is well settled that when a competent Authority makes a new law which is totally inconsistent with the earlier law and the two cannot stand together any longer it must be construed that the earlier law has been repealed by necessary implication by the later law.	None
In considering the applicability of section 6 of the General Clause Act 1897 in the case of St ate Of Orissa Vs. M.A Tuloch and Co. this court had observed The entire theory underlying implied repeals is that there is no need for the later enactment has been repealed by using any particular set of words or form of drafting but that if the legislative intent to supersede the earlier law is manifested by the enactment provisions as to effect such supersession, then there is law a repeal notwithstanding the absence of the words repeal in the later statute.	None
The aforesaid observation no doubt has been made while analysing the effect of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act and the continuance of rights accrued and liabilities incurred under the superseded enactment and thus has no direct application to the case in hand.	None
In the case Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City I vs. Godavari sugar Mills Ltd. on which Mr. Lekhi learn ed senior counsel placed strong reliance, the question for consideration was whether the ordnance be repugnant to section 23A of the Income Tax Act, 1922 it can be said that there is an implied repeal of section 23A of the Act.	None
In this connection it was held by this court there is a manifest repugnancy between the provisions of the Ordinance and of section 23A	None
if the Act and it must be taken that there is a implied repeal of Section 23 of the Act to the Extent of that repugnancy created by Section 3 of the Ordinance and so long as the ordinance remain in force.	None
But in view of our conclusion that there is no repugnancy between Section 3 read with Section 6 of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act and the provisions of Section 127(1)(iii) of the Municipalities Act and both the provisions operate in two different fields the principle of implied repeal will have no application.	Reasoning
In the connection it would be appropriate for us to notice one decision of this court in the Case of The Western India Theatres Ltd. vs. The Cantonment Board, Poona, Cantonment, where the validity of levy of entertainment tax under Entry 50 in Schedule VII of the Government of India Act.	Reasoning
1935 was under consideration.	None
The Entry in question was to the effect taxes on luxury or entertainment or amusement It was contended before the Court that the tax in question was really a tax imposed for the privilege of carrying on any trade or calling under Entry 46 and, therefore, the same cannot exceed Rs.100 per a nnum as provided under Section 142A of the Government of India Act 1935 and Rs.250 per a nnum under Article 276(2) of the Constitution.	None
The Court repelling the argument held The entry contemplates luxuries, entertainment, and amusements as objects on which the tax is to be imposed.	None
If the words are to be so regarded , as we think they must, there can be no reason to differentiate between the given and the receiver of the luxuries, entertainments or amusements and both may, with equal propriety, be made amenable to the tax.	None
It is true that economists regards an entertainment, it does become a tax on expenditure, entertainments or amusements .	None
The entry, as we have said, contemplates a law with respect to these matters regarded as objects and a law which imposes tax on the act of entertaining is within the entry whether it falls on the giver or receiver of that entertainment.	None
Nor is the impugned tax a tax imposed for the privilege of carrying on any trade or calling.	None
Thus considered, the tax leviable on Motor Vehicles when used or kept for use under section 3(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Motor vehicles Taxation Act is different from the tax leviable on Motor Vehicles.	Reasoning
Entering the limits of the Municipality under Section 127(1) (iii) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act, 1961 and there is no repugnancy between the two and both the provisions can therefore operate in its own field.	Reasoning
Since under Section 127(1)(iii) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipality Act, Municipality could levy a tax on Motor Vehicles entering the limits of the Municipality, the same could be levied by the Cantonment Board in exercise of its power under Section 60 of the Cantonments Act with the previous sanction of the Central Government .	Reasoning
Consequently, notifications issued by the Cantonment Boards of Mhow, Jabalpur and Saugar were valid notifications issued under section 60 of the cantonments Act and imposition of tax on motor Vehicles entering into the limits of the Cantonment Boards cannot be said to be invalid or inoperative.	Reasoning
The High court in our opinion committed error in striking down those notifications on the ground of repugnancy with this special legislation, namely, the Madhya Pradesh Motor Vehicles Taxation Act.	None
So far as the contention of Mr. Lekhi, the learned senior counsel with regard to the proviso to Section 7 of the Taxation Act is concerned, we however, do not find any force in the same in asmuchas Section 7 deals with the grant to the local authorities and it provides that if a grant was being paid by the state Government to any such Board or Committee immediately before the commencement of the Taxation Act then the said grant shall be continued to be paid.	None
But the Cantonment Board by virtue of the Proviso will not be entitled to receive the said grant unless it agrees not to recover any tax, toll or licence in respect of th e Motor Vehicles.	Reasoning
In other words, Section 7 and proviso thereto deals with right of the Cantonment Board and the Municipality to receive a grant which was being paid by the state Government prior to the commencement of the Taxation Act and t he said provision has no connection with the imposition of tax on Motor Vehicle Which is governed by section 3 (2) and the bar on such imposition which is contained in Section 6 of the Taxation Act.	Reasoning
In this view of the matter , we are unable to accept the contention of Mr. Lekhi, the learned senior counsel that conjoint reading of section 6 and 7 and its proviso would lead to the conclusion that even under the Taxation Act a Cantonment Board was entitled to impose tax on Motor Vehicles used or kept for use notwithstanding the bar under Section 6.Coming to the conclusion of the applicability of doctrine of desuetude Mr. Lekhi, the learned senior counsel strongly relied upon the decision of this Court in Municipal Corporation for City of Pune and another vs. Bharat forge Company Ltd. and other and submitted that the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act must be held to be of disuse as no grant as provided in Section 7 of the Taxation Act has ever been made at any point of time after the enactment of the said Act in 1947.	Reasoning
This contention is wholly unsustainable in law in asmuchas we are not concerned with the question of grant to local authorities and Cantonment Board as provided under Section 7 of the Taxation Act but we are concerned with the leviability of tax on Motor Vehicles under Section 3(2) of the Taxation Act.	Reasoning
it is nobodys case that no tax was being levied on Motor Vehicles which is used or kep t for use under Section 3(2) of the Madhya Pradesh Motor Vehicle Taxation Act , 1947.	Reasoning
That apart to apply the principle of desuetude it is necessary to establish that the state in question has been in disuse for long and the contrary practic e of some duration gas evolved.	Reasoning
In other words to make the aforesaid principle applicable in the case in hand it is required to be established that the provisions of Section 3(2) of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act has been in disuse for a long period and that the imposition of tax on entry of Motor Vehicles into the Cantonment limit has been in operation for a fairly long period.	Reasoning
Neither of these two ingredients has been satisfied in the case in hand and therefore the aforesaid principle of desuetude is of no application to the case in hand.	Reasoning
In the aforesaid premises, these appeals are allowed.	Decision
The impugned judgments of the Madhya Pradesh High Court are set aside and it is held that the respective cantonment Boards Pursuant to the notifications issued by the Cantonment Boards in exercise of power under Section 60 of the Cantonments Act.	Decision
But in the circumstances there will be no order as to costs.	Decision
