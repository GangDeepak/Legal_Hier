3.	None
In Civil Appeal No. 43 of 1963 it is contended on behalf of the appellant that the storage charges granted at Rs. 300 p.m. by the High Court were not justified upon the evidence in the case.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted than the report of Mr. J. S. Mongia, dated August 5, 1947 was taken by the High Court as the basis of its calculation and the fair rent payable to the plaintiff ought not to have exceeded the rate of Rs. 200 p.m. mentioned in Mr. Mongias report.	Arguments of Petitioner
We do not consider there is any substance in this submission.	Reasoning
Mr. J. S. Mongia was deputed by the defendant to conduct an enquiry and make a report with regard to storage charges claimed by the plaintiff.	Reasoning
It appears from his reportEx.	None
D19, dated August 5, 1947 that Mr. Mongia calculated that the storage of iron sheets took about 1,485 cubic feet of space.	Reasoning
It is true that Mr. Mongia considered that the fair rent payable was Rs. 200 p.m. but the High Court increased the rate in view of the fact that at the time of this inspection some of the iron sheets had been already removed.	Reasoning
There is evidence that at the time of Mr. Mongias inspection the weight of iron sheets stored was 498 tons, though the quantity of iron sheets originally stored was 600 tons.	Reasoning
The High Court has also taken into consideration the additional services rendered by the plaintiff in looking after the iron sheets during the period of storage.	Reasoning
We do not, therefore, find it possible to accept the contention of the appellant that the High court was not justified in fixing the rent at Rs. 300 p.m. as godown charges.	Reasoning
As regards the floor space, the High Court has remarked that the calculation of the trial Judge for the surface area was not correct.	Reasoning
It appears that the trial Court accepted the evidence of Man Mohan LalD. W. 7that	None
the floor space occupied by 600 tons of iron sheets could not be more than 2,600 sq. ft., but the High Court pointed out that this calculation was fallacious, because a space of 1 foot was allowed between the bundles of iron sheets and this was hardly sufficient for the operation of overturning the bundles of sheets in order to prevent rust.	Reasoning
Taking all the factors into consideration including the report of Mr. Mongia, the High Court reached the conclusion that the rent of Rs. 300 p.m. was a reasonable charge.	Reasoning
We see no reason for taking a different view from the High Court on this aspect of the case.	None
4.	None
It was next argued on behalf of the appellant that the suit was governed by Article 61 of the Limitation Act and the claim of the plaintiff in regard to items (c) to (f) was barred by time.	Arguments of Petitioner
We do not accept this argument as correct.	None
The transaction of bailment between the parties was a single and indivisible transaction and the claim of compensation made by the plaintiff cannot be split up into different items for applying the bar of limitation.	Reasoning
We are also of the opinion that the provisions of Art. 61 of the Limitation Act do not apply to the present case.	Reasoning
The High Court was right in taking the view that the suit was governed by Art.	Reasoning
120 of the Limitation Act and that the plaintiff was not barred under that Article.	Reasoning
5.	None
It was finally contended on behalf of the appellant that, in any event, the plaintiff was not entitled to a decree for interest to the extent of Rs. 2,97420, as claimed in the plaint.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our opinion, the argument of learned Counsel for the appellant on this point is well founded and must be accepted as correct.	None
It is well established that interest may be awarded for the period prior to the date of the institution of the suit if there is an agreement for the payment of interest at fixed rate or if interest is payable by the usage of trade having the force of law, or under the provisions of any substantive law entitling the plaintiff to recover interest, as for instance, under S. 80 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the Court may award interest at the rate of 6 per cent.	Reasoning
per annum, when no rate of interest is specified in the promissory note or bill of exchange.	Reasoning
There is in the present case neither usage not any contract, express or implied, to justify the award of interest.	Reasoning
Nor is interest payable by virtue of any provision of the law governing the case.	Reasoning
Under the Interest Act, 1839, the Court may allow interest to the plaintiff if the amount claimed is a sum certain which is payable at a certain time by virtue of a written instrument.	Reasoning
But it is conceded that the amount claimed in this case is not a sum certain but compensation for unliquidated amount.	Reasoning
On behalf of the respondent it was submitted by Mr. Aggarwala that interest may be awarded under the Interest Act which contains a provision that interest shall be payable in all cases in which it is now payable by law But this provision only applies to cases in which the Court of Equity exercises jurisdiction to allow interest.	Arguments of Respondent
The legal position has been explained by the Judicial Committee in Bengal Nagpur Rly. Co. Ltd. v. Ruttanji Ramji, 65 Ind App 66 at p. 72 (AIR 1938 PC 67 at p. 70), as follows As observed by Lord Tomlin in Maine and New Brunswick Electrical Power Co. v. Hart, (1929)	None
AC 631, at p. 640 (AIR 1929 PC 185 at p. 188),In order to invoke a rule of equity it is necessary in the first instance to establish the existence of a state of circumstances which attracts the equitable jurisdiction, as, for example, the nonperformance of a contract of which equity can give specific performance.	None
The decision of the Judicial Committee in 65 Ind App 66 (AIR 1938 PC 67 ), was relied upon by this Court in Thawardas Pherumal v. Union of India (1955) 2	None
SCR 48 ( (S) AIR 1955 SC 468 ), in rejecting a claim for interest.	None
In that case, a contractor entered into a contract with the Dominion of India for the supply of bricks.	None
A clause in the contract required all disputes arising out of or relating to the contract to be referred to arbitration.	None
The dispute having arisen, the matter was referred to arbitration and the arbitrator gave an award in the contractors favour.	None
The Union of India which has succeeded to the rights and obligations of the Dominion, contested the award on various grounds one of which was the liability to pay interest on the amount awarded.	None
Bose, J., in delivering the judgment of the Court, observed that the interest awarded to the contractor could not, in law, be awarded.	None
He pointed out that the arbitrator is not a Court within the meaning of the Interest Act, 1839 and, in any event, interest could only be awarded if there was a debt or a sum certain payable at a certain time or otherwise by virtue of some written contract and there must have been a demand in writing stating that interest will be demanded from the date of the demand.	None
6.	None
The same view has been expressed by this Court in a later caseUnion of India v. Rallia Ram, AIR 1963 SC 1685 in which the respondent had claimed from the Dominion of India, compensation in respect of the goods delivered to him under the contract, interest on the amounts raised by him for carrying out the contract and for incidental expenses incurred by him after delivery of the goods.	None
The dispute was referred to arbitration and the award granted to the respondent three sums of money on the following heads (1) loss suffered by the respondent in respect of goods not returned by him computed on the basis of difference between the price paid and price received by him on sale, (2) incidental charges on account of expenses incurred on advertisement, storage, agency commission, etc., (3) interest on sum refunded to respondent in respect of returned packets.	None
It was held by this Court that the award of interest under the third head could not be sustained as the contract did not provide for payment of interest in respect of amounts paid by the respondent if the contract fell through.	None
Nor could interest be awarded under S. 61 of the Sale of Goods Act or under the Interest Act on grounds of equity.	None
In the absence of any usage or contract express or implied, or of any provision of law to justify the award of interest, the arbitrator cannot award interest by way of damages caused to the respondent for wrongful detention of money.	None
Applying the principle to the present case, it is clear that the plaintiff is not entitled to a decree for interest to the extent of Rs. 2,97420 claimed by him in the plaint and, therefore, the decree granted by the High Court in favour of the plaintiff should be reduced to this extent.	Reasoning
7.	None
In Civil Appeal No. 44 of 1963 preferred on behalf of the plaintiff the main argument put forward by Mr. C. B. Aggarwala was in regard to the calculation of the storage charges for the iron sheets.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that the plaintiff had given notice to the defendant claiming rent at the rate of Rs. 4 per ton per month and there was no protest on behalf of the defendant and, therefore, it must be taken that there was an implied agreement between the parties that rent would be paid at that rate, i.e. at the rate of Rs. 2,400 per month.	Arguments of Petitioner
We do not think there is any warrant for this submission.	Reasoning
Merely because the plaintiff had claimed storage charges at the rate of Rs. 4 per ton per month and there was silence on the part of the defendant, it cannot be deemed that there was acquiescence on the part of the defendant and that there was an implied undertaking on its part to pay godown rent at that rate.	Reasoning
We have already discussed the question of reasonable compensation to the plaintiff for storage of the iron sheets and, for reasons already given, we hold that the finding of the High Court on this issue is correct.	Reasoning
8.	None
In the result, we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to the decree with regard to items (a) to (f) as mentioned in the judgment of the High Court, i.e. and not to interest, i.e., item (g).	Decision
We accordingly allow Civil Appeal No. 43 of 1963 and modify the judgment and decree of the High Court to the extent indicated above.	Decision
Civil Appeal 44 of 1963 is dismissed.	Decision
There will be no order as to costs of both these appeals.	Decision
