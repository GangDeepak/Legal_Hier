 SINGH, J. The petitioners in different writ petitions have questioned the power of the Central Government to grant licences to different nonGovernment Companies to establish and maintain Telecommunications System in the country and the validity of the procedure adopted by the Central Government for the said grant.	Issue
In February 1993, the Finance Minister in his Budget speech announced Governments intention to encourage privatesector involvement and participation in Telecom to supplement efforts of Department of Telecommunications especially in creation of internationally competitive industry.	Facts
May 13, 1994 National Telecom policy was announced which was placed in the Parliament saying that the aim of the policy was to supplement the effort of the Department of Telecommunications in providing telecommunications services.	Facts
Later, guidelines for induction of privatesector into basic telephone services were announced and a Committee was set up to draft the tender documents for basic telephone services under the Chairmanship of G.S.S. Murthy.	Facts
Ministry of Communications published the Tender Documents for Provision of Telephone Service.	Facts
It specified and prescribed the terms and conditions for the basic services and it also conceived foreign participation but as a joint venture prescribing a ceiling on total foreign equity so far the Indian Company was concerned was not to exceed 49 of the total equity apart from other conditions.	Facts
Pursuant to the notice inviting tenders, tenders were submitted for different circles, but before licences could be granted by the Central Government, writ petitions were filed in different High Courts as well as before this Court.	None
All writ petitions filed before different High Courts were transferred to this Court to be heard together.	Facts
Telecommunications has been internationally recognized as a public utility of strategic importance.	Facts
The variety of Telecommunications services that has become available globally in the last decade is remarkable.	Facts
It is being realized that economy is increasingly related to the way this Telecom infrastructure functions for purpose of processing and transmission of information, which has acquired central stage in the economic world today.	Facts
The special aspect about Telecommunications is inter connectivity which is known as any to any requirement.	Facts
Because of the economic growth and commercial changes in different Parts of the world, need for interconnectivity means that communication systems have to be compatible with each other and have to be actually interconnected.	None
Because of this, there is a demand even in developing countries to have communication system on international standards.	Facts
Even after several decades of the invention of the telephone system, in almost all countries Telecommunications was the subject of monopoly supplied with the public network operator normally being the State owned Corporation or Government Department.	Facts
Then it was not thought due to different considerations that such right could be granted to private sectors denuding the right of the monopoly of the Government to maintain and run the system of Telecommunications.	Facts
The developed countries first took decision in respect of privatization of Telecom which amounted to giving up the claim of exclusive privilege over such system and this led to the transition from monopoly to a duopoly policy in many countries.	Facts
India, although a developing country also faced a challenge in this sector.	Facts
By and large it was realized that this sector needed acceleration because of the adoption of liberalized economic policy for the economic growth of the country.	Facts
It appears that the policy makers were faced with the implications for public welfare visavis th e sector being capital intensive.	Facts
How the network is well maintained so as it reaches the largest number of people at a price to be paid by such users which can be held as reasonable?	Facts
This issue was also interrelated with the defence and nation al security of the nation.	Facts
Different committees and bodies constituted from time to time examined the Telecom policy which could be adopted by the nation from different aspects and angles.	Facts
The counsel appearing in some of the writ petitions questioned the validity and propriety of the new Telecom Policy itself on the ground that it shall endanger The national security of the country, and shall not serve the economic interest of the nation.	Facts
According to them, telecommunication being a sensitive service should always be within the exclusive domain and control of the Central Government and under no situation it should be parted with by way of grant of licences to nonGovernment Companies and private bodies.	None
The national policies in respect of economy, finance, communications, trade, telecommunications and others have to be decided by the Parliament and the representatives of the people on the floor of the Parliament can challenge and question any such policy ad opted by the ruling Government.	Facts
In the case of R.K. Garg etc. etc. v. Union of India Ors., 1982	None
SCR 347 a Constitution Bench of this Court said Another rule of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion etc.	None
It has been said by no less a person than Holmes, J. that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straight jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where, having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with, greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature.	None
The court should feel more inclined to give judicial deference to legislature judgment in the field of economic regulation than in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved.	None
In Morey v. Dond, 354 US 457 Frankfurter, J said In the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial difference to legislative judgment.	None
The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility.	None
The courts have only the power to destroy, not to reconstruct.	None
When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation, the uncertainty, the liability to error, the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the judges have been overruled by eventsself limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability.	None
What has been said in respect of legislations is applicable even in respect of policies which have been adopted by the Parliament.	None
They cannot be tested in Court of Law.	None
The courts cannot express their opinion as to whether at a particular juncture or under a particular situation prevailing in the country any such national policy should have been adopted or not.	None
There may be views and views, opinions and opinions which may be shared and believed by citizens of the country including the representatives of the people in the Parliament.	None
But that has to be sorted out in the Parliament which has to approve such policies.	None
Privatization is a fundamental concept underlying the questions about the power to make economic decision s.	None
What should be the role of the State in the economic development of the nation?	Issue
How the resources of the country shall be used?	Issue
How the goals fixed shall be attained?	Issue
What are to be the safeguards to prevent the abuse of the economic power?	Issue
What is the mechanism of accountability to ensure that the decision regarding Privatization is in public interest?	Issue
All these questions have to be answered by a vigilant Parliament.	None
Courts have their limitations because these issues rest wit h the policy makers for the nation.	None
No direction can be given or is expected from the courts unless while implementing such policies, there is violation or infringement of any of the Constitutional or statutory provision.	None
The new Telecom Policy was placed before the Parliament and it shall be deemed that Parliament has approved the same.	None
This Court cannot review and examine as to whether said policy should have been adopted.	None
Of course, whether there is any legal or Constitutional bar in adopting such policy can certainly be examined by the court.	None
The primary ground of the challenge in respect of the legality of the implementation of the policy is that Central Government which has the exclusive privilege under Section 4 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs which shall include telephones, has no authority to part with the said privilege to nonGovernment Companies for the consideration to be paid by such companies on basis of tenders submitted by them this amounts to an out and out sale of the said privilege.	None
The expression telegraph has been defined in Section 3(1) 3(1) telegraph means any appliance, instrument, material or apparatus used or capable of use of transmission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, visual or other electromagnetic emissions, Radio waves or Hertzian waves, galvanic, electric or magnetic means.	None
Explanation  Radio waves or Hertzian waves means electromagnetic waves of frequencies lower than 3, 000 giga cycles per second propagated in Space without artificial guide.	None
Section 4 of the Act is as follows 4.	None
(1) Within India the Central Government shall have the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs Provided that the Central Government may grant a licence, on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as it thinks fit, to any person to establish, maintain or work a telegraph within any part of India Provided further that the Central Government may, by rules made under this Act and published in the Official Gazette, permit, subject to such restrictions and conditions as it thinks fit, the establishment, maintenance and working (a) of wireless telegraphs on ships within Indian territorial waters and on aircraft within or above India, or Indian territorial waters and(b) of telegraphs other than wireless telegraphs within any part of India.(2)	None
The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, delegate to the telegraph authority all or any of its powers under the first proviso to subsection (1).The exercise by the telegraph authority of any power so delegated shall be subject to such restrictions and conditions the Central Government may, by the notification, think fit to impose.	None
There is no dispute that the expression telegraph as defined in the Act shall include telephones and telecommunications services.	None
Subsection (1) of Sect ion 4 on plain reading vests the right of exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs in the Central Government, but the proviso thereof enables the Central Government to grant licence, on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as it thinks fit, to any person to establish, maintain and work telegraph within any part of India.	None
It is true that the Act was enacted as early as in the year 1885 and central Government exercised the exclusive privilege of establishing, maintaining and working telegraphs for more than a century.	None
But the framers of the Act since the very beginning conceived and contemplated that a situation may arise when the Central Government may have to grant a licence to any Person to establish, maintain or work such telegraph including telephone within any part of India.	None
With that object in view, it was provided and prescribed that licence may be granted to any person on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as the Central Government may think fit.	None
If proviso to subsection (1) of Section 4 itself provides for grant of licence on condition to be prescribed and considerations to be paid to any person, then whenever such licence is granted, such grantee can establish, maintain or work the telephone system in that part of India.	None
In view of the clear and unambiguous proviso to subsection (1) of Section 4, enabling the Central Government to grant licences for establishment, maintenance or working of telegraphs including telecommunications, how can it be held that the privilege which has been vested by subsection (1) of Section 4 of the Act in the Central Government cannot be granted to others on conditions and for considerations regarding payments?	None
According to us the power and authority of the Central Government to grant licences to private bodies including Companies subject to conditions and considerations for payments cannot be questioned.	Reasoning
That right flows from the same subsection (1) of Section 4 which vests that privilege and right in the Central Government.	Reasoning
Of course, there can be controversy in respect of the manner in which such right and privilege which has been vested in the Central Government has been parted with in favour of private bodies.	Reasoning
It cannot be disputed that in respect of grant of any right or licence by the Central Government or an authority which can be held to be State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution not only the source of the power has to be traced, but it has also to be found that the procedure adopted for such grant was reasonable, rational and inconfirmity with the conditions which had been announced.	Reasoning
Statutory authorities have some times used their discretionary power to confer social or economic benefits on a particular section or group of community.	Reasoning
The plea raised is that the Act vests power in them to be exercised as they think fit.	Reasoning
This is a misconception.	Reasoning
Such provisions while vesting powers in authorities including the Central Government also enjoin a fiduciary duty to act with due restrain, to avoid misplaced philanthropy or ideology.	None
Reference in this connect ion can be made to the cases Roberts v. Hopewood, 1925 AC 578 Prescott v.Birmingham Corporation, Taylor Ors.	None
v. Munrow Bromley London Borough Council v. Greater London Council and another, (1 982) 1 ALLER 129.	None
As such Central Government while exercising its statutory power under first proviso to Section 4(1) of the Act, of granting licences for establishment, maintenance and working of Telecommunications has a fiduciary duty as well.	None
The new experiment has to fulfill the tests laid down by courts for exercise of a statutory discretion.	None
It cannot be exercised in a manner which can be held to be unlawful and which is now known in administrative law as Wednesbury principle, stated in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corp.	None
The aforesaid principle is attracted where it is shown, that an authority exercising the discretion has taken a decision which is devoid of any plausible justification and any authority having reasonable persons could not have taken the said decision.	None
In the case of Bromley LBC (supra) it was said by Lord Diplock Powers to direct or approve the general level an d structure of fares to be charged by the LTE for the carriage of passengers on its transport system, although unqualified by any express words in the Act.	None
may none the less be subject to implied limitation s when expressed to be exercisable by a local authority such as the GLC As such Central Government is expected to put such conditions while granting licences, which shall safeguard the public interest and the interest of the nation.	None
Such conditions should be commensurate with the obligations that flow while parting with the privilege which has been exclusively vested in the Central Government by the Act.	None
A stand was taken that even if it is assumed that because of the proviso to subsection (1) of Section 4, the Central Government can grant licences in respect of establishing, maintaining or working of telecommunications to Indian Companies registered under the Indian Companies Act, such power should have been exercised only after framing of rules under Section 7 of the Act.	None
In support of this stand, attention was drawn to second proviso to subsection (1) of Section 4 which says that the Central Government may, by rules made under this Act permit subject to such restrictions and conditions as it thinks fit, the establishment, maintenance and working  (a) of wireless telegraphs on ships within Indian territorial waters and on aircraft within or above India, or Indian territorial waters and (b) of telegraphs other than wireless telegraphs within any part of India.	None
It was pointed out that clause (b) of the second proviso to subsection (1) of Section 4 shall govern the grant of the licence under the first provio to subsection (1) of Section 4 as well because both provisos contemplate grant of licence permit for telegraphs within any part of India to any person by the Central Government.	None
At first blush tghis argument appears to be attarctive, but on closer examination, it appears that whereas the first proviso to subsection (1) of Section 4 contemplates the grant of a licence, second proviso to be same subsection (1) of Section 4 speaks about permitting establishment, maintenance and working of telegraphs other than wireless telegraphs within any part of India.	None
It need not be pointed out that the concept of grant of licence to establish, maintain or work a telegraph shall be different from granting Permission under the second proviso to establish, maintain or to work a telegraph within any part of India.	None
They do not conceive and contemplate the same area of operation.	None
It may be relevant to point out that so far clause (b) of second proviso is concerned, it excludes wireless telegraphs, which restriction has not been prescribed in the first proviso.	None
The second proviso was introduced by Act No.VII of 1914.From a copy of the Bill which was introduced in the Council of the Governor General of India in respect of adding one more proviso to subsection (1) of Section 4 of the Act, it appears there was no clause (b).	None
In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the said Amendment, it was said that the second proviso was being introduced, for establishment, maintenance and working of the wireless telegraphs on ships within Indian territorial waters.	None
However, in the Amending Act, clause (b) aforesaid was also introduced enabling the Central Government, by rules to permit, subject to such restrictions and conditions, the establishment, maintenance and working of telegraphs other than wireless telegraphs within any part of India.	None
According to us, there is no question of clause (b) of the second proviso controlling or overriding in any manner the first proviso which does not speak of the grant of licence by any rules made under the said Act.	None
Section 7 enables the Central Government to make rules consistent with the provisions of the Act for the conduct of all or any telegraphs established, maintained or worked by the Government or by persons licensed under the said Act.	None
Clause (e) of subsection (2) of Section 7 prescribes that rules under the said Section may provide for conditions and restrictions subject to which any telegraph line, appliance or apparatus for telegraphic communication shall be established, maintained, worked, repaired, transferred, shifted, withdrawn or disconnected.	None
there is no dispute that no such rules have been framed as contemplated by Section 7(2)(e) of the Act.	None
But in that event, it cannot be held that unless such rules are framed, the Power under sub section (1) of Section 4 cannot be exercised by the Central Government.	None
The power has been granted to the Central Government by the Act itself, and the exercise of that right, by the Central Government, cannot be circumscribed, limited or restricted on any subordinate legislation to be framed under Section 7 of t he Act.	None
No doubt, it was advisable on the part of the Central Government to frame such rules when it was so desired by the Parliament.	None
Clause (e) to subsection (2) of Section 7 was introduced by Amending Act 47 of 1957.	None
If the conditions and restrictions subject to which any telegraph  telephone line is to be established, maintained or worked had been prescribed by the rules, there would have been less chances of abuse or arbitrary exercise of the said power.	None
That is why b y the Amending Act 47 of 1957 the Parliament required the rules to be framed.	None
But the question is as to whether specifically vested in it by first proviso to Section 4(1) of the Act?	None
Even in absence of rules the power to grant licence on such conditions and for such considerations can be exercised by the Central Government but then such power should be exercised on well settled principles and norms which can satisfy the test of Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
If necessary for the purpose of satisfying as to whether, the grant of the licence has been made strictly in terms of the proviso complying and fulfilling the conditions prescribed, which can be held not only reasonable, rational, but also in the public interest can be examined by courts.	None
It need not be impressed that an authority which has been empowered to attach such conditions, as it thinks fit, must have regard to the relevant considerations and has to disregard the irrelevant ones.	None
The authority has to genuinely examine the applications on its individual merit and not to promote a purpose alien to the spirit of the Act.	None
In this background, the courts have applied the test of a reasonable man i.e. the decision should not be taken or discretion should not be exercised in a manner, as no reasonable man could have ever exercised.	None
Many administrative decisions including decisions relating to awarding of contracts are vested in a statutory authority or a body constituted under an administrative order .	None
Any decision taken by such authority or a body can be questioned primarily on the grounds (i) decision has been taken in bad faith (ii) decision is based on irrational or irrelevant considerations (iii) decision has been taken without following the prescribed procedure which is imperative in nature.	None
While exercising the power of judicial review even in respect of contracts entered on behalf of the Government or authority, which can be held to be State within meaning of Article 12 of the constitution courts have to address while examining the grievance of any petitioner as to whether the decision has been vitiated on one ground or the other.	None
It is well settled that the onus to demonstrate that such decision has been vitiated because of adopting a procedure not sanctioned by law, or because of bad faith or taking into consideration factors which are irrelevant, is on the person who questions the validity thereof.	None
This onus is not discharged only by raising a doubt in the mind of the court, but by satisfying the court that the authority or the body which had been vested with the power to take decision has adopted a procedure which does not satisfy the test of Article 14 of the Constitution or which is against the provisions of the statute in question or has acted with oblique motive or has failed in its function to examine each claim on its own merit on relevant considerations.	None
Under the changed scenarios and circumstances prevailing in the society, courts are not following the rule of judicial selfrestraint.	None
But at the same time all decisions which are to be taken by an authority vested with such power cannot be tested and examined by the court.	None
The situation is all the more difficult so far the commercial contracts are concerned.	None
The Parliament has adopted and resolved a national policy towards liberalization and opening of the national gates for foreign investors.	None
The question of awarding licences and contracts does not depend merely on the competitive rates offered several factors have to be taken into consideration by an expert body which is more familiar with the intricacies of that particular trade.	None
While granting licences a statutory authority or the body so constituted, should have latitude to select the best offers on terms and conditions to be prescribed taking into account the economic and social interest of the nation.	None
Unless any party aggrieved satisfies the court that the ultimate decision in respect of the selection has been vitiated, normally courts should be reluctant to interfere with the same.	None

The Tender Evaluation Committee comprised of the following members for e valuation of the bids for basic telephone service Shri B.S. Karandikar, Member (Production) Chairman Shri S.D. Chaturvedi, Jt.	None
Secretary (T) Member Smt.	None
Runu Ghosh, DDG (LF) Member Shri S.K. Jain, DDG (TX) M ember Shri M.K. Garg, DDG (VAS) Member Shri O.P. Choudhary, DDG (BS) Member Convenor.	None
All the tenders were placed before the said Committee which after evaluating all the bids received submitted its report.	None
We are not concerned with the details of the said report, but it shall be proper to refer to some salient features which have bearing on some of the issues raised in these writ petitions.	None
As one of the tenderers M s HFCL  Bezeq had emerged as the highest bidder in nine circles, the Committee reported.	None
Multiple H1 Bids from a Single Bidder (1) The Committee observed that in nine Circles, only one bidder viz.	None
M s HFCL Bezeq have emerged as the highest bidder.	None
If all the nine Circles are awarded to this bidder, it would result in a kind of private monopoly with M s HFCL emerging as the single largest dominant Private undertaking in this sector with over 75 share of additional DELs over a period of three years.(2)	None
The main purpose of allowing the private sector to enter into Basic Service was to complement the efforts of DOT in reaching the target of telephoneondemand situation by 1997, covering all villages as early as possible and providing telecom services of world standard.	None
If we entrust the development of telecom in so many major Circles to only one bidder an d that bidder is not able to deliver the number of lines promised due to inability in a short time to mobilize the very large resources required for providing services in so many Circles, t hen development of Telecom in the country will be stunted.	None
Further, Telecom being a very sensitive sector from the point of view of national security, private foreign investment should be more evenly distributed and the predominance of any one foreign country (which would result from one bidder with a specific foreign partner getting a majority of Circles) should be avoided.(4)	None
Taking all these factors into consideration, imposition of a limit on the maximum number of Circles to be allotted in A B category circles, seems to be called for.	None
The restriction can be as follows Out of category A B circles bid, not more than three circles should be allotted to any single bidder.	None
This restriction need not apply to category C circles which have evoked poor response from the bidders.(ii) Subject to this restriction, the H1 bidder should be given an option to choose the Circles.(iii)	None
The Circles which are vacated by H1 bidder after exercising the above option will need to be offered to the rest of the bidders in the descending order of their ranking for matching the package offered by the H1 bidder.	None
The Committee felt that the gap between H1 and the H2 bids in such Circles referred to in para B 4(iii) above is so wide that there appears to be remote possibility of any of the bidders matching the H1 package.	None
In such a situation, the Department may have to go in for retendering for these Circles.	None
However, the Committee noted that if we invite fresh bids through an open tender for both technical commercial as well as financial bids, this process would take a very long time and the main purpose of allowing the private sector to participate in the operation of Basic Service, which was to meet the objectives of the National Telecom Policy would be defeated.	None
The Committee, therefore, felt that the purpose will be served by inviting fresh financial bids only, from among those bidders except H1 who have already participated in the original tender and whose bids have been found technically and commercially compliant.	None
The Committee observed that for this purpose, an important issue will be fixation of Reserve Price below which no offer would be accepted.	None
The normal procedure would have been to keep the levy quoted by the highest bidder as the reserve price, since the highest bidder has not withdrawn his offer but would be prevented from accepting these Circles on account of the proposed restriction placed on the number of Circles to be allotted to any single bidder.	None
But since all bidders for a particular Circle would have already refused to match the highest levy before calling for fresh financial bids, no purpose would be served by keeping that levy as a reserve price.	None
From the aforesaid recommendations of the Committee it appears that it recommended that out of category A and B service areas not more than three service areas be allotted to any bidder no such restriction was to be applied to category b service areas which had evoked poor response from the bidders.	None
It also recommended that while applying the above restrictions the H1 bidder may be given an option to choose from the service areas where he had offered the package with highest ranking.	None
It is no doubt little surprising as to how and why M s HFCL  Bezeq offered such high bids in nine circles.	None
But it is an admitted position that in view of the recommendations of the Tender Evaluation Committee capping system was introduced and aforesaid M s HFCL  Bezeq was allotted only three circles i.e. Delhi, U.P. (West) and Haryana so far categories A and B circles are concerned.	None
In respect of t he other A and B circles although the said M s HFCL  Bezeq was the highest.	None
bidder, the offer was not accepted because in that event it would have led to a virtual monopoly, the said M s HFCL Bezeq having emerged as a single largest dominant private undertaking.	None
The learned counsel appearing in different writ petitions have attacked this policy of capping.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, in spite of repeated queries, none of them could satisfy as to how in this process the said M s HFCL  Bezeq h ad been a gainer or the nation has been a loser.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that if this capping system would not have been applied, then a much higher amount would have been received because of the high tenders submitted by said M s HFCL  Bezeq for ot her circles which on principle of capping was denied to the said Company.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also Submitted that in any event, no choice should have been given to the bidders to select the circles and in respect thereof unilateral decision should have be en taken by the Central Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
As pointed out above, the decision regarding capping and putting a limit in respect of category A and B circles bid to not more than three was recommended by the Tender Evaluation Committee which appears to have been accepted by the Central Government.	Arguments of Petitioner
Unless it is alleged and proved that the Tender Evaluation Committees decision in respect of capping was because of any bad faith or due to some irrational consideration, according to us the Central Government cannot be held responsible for that decision.	Arguments of Petitioner
It may be mentioned at the outset that in none of the writ petitions there is any whisper much less any allegation of malafide against the members of the Tender Evaluation Committee stating any one of them had a bias in favour of one bidder or the other or that they have acted on dictate of any higher authority, abdicating their functions entrusted to them.	Arguments of Petitioner
Some of the petitioners urged that policy of capping was applied after receipt of the tenders.	Arguments of Petitioner
This is not correct.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the Tender Documents as quoted above it had been clearly stated that Telecom Authority is free to restrict the number of the service areas for which one Company can be licensed to provide the service.	Arguments of Petitioner
As such, it cannot be urged that the decision regarding capping restricting the award of licence in category A and B circles to one biddar to three was taken with some ulterior motive or purpose, not being one of the terms specified and prescribed in the tender documents.	None
It was also pointed out in respect of M s HFCL Bezeq that its networth was shown at Rs.4, 622 crores, but the break up of the networth of different Companies which are the partner Companies thereof, it shall appear that one foreign Company holding only 26 equity share has shown networth of Rs.4, 1116 crores i.e. 89.05 whereas the Indian Company Consortium Leader HFCL having equity share of 44 has shown its networth was Rs.62 crores i.e. 1.34.	None
As already pointed out above clause 2.2 of Section II of Part I of tender documents required the bidder Company to produce the copy of the agreement between the Indian and Foreign Company including the approval of the Government of India for the terms of foreign participation and certificate from the competent authority in Government of India to the effect that total foreign equity in the bidder Company does not exceed 49.

The terms and conditions of tender documents restricted the bidder Company that it shall not have total foreign equity in excess of 49.	None
In the instant case, the foreign Company admittedly does not have foreign equity in excess of 49.	None
It was also pointed out on behalf of the respondents that when the tender document prescribed about the networth of the bidder Company, it did not mean the actual investment of that amount.	None
If a foreign Company having equity less than 49 has networth to fulfill the requirement of the bidder Company, its bid had to be examined by the Tender Evaluation Committee as has been done in the present case.	None
Counsel appearing for writ petitioners and M s HFCL  Bezeq were heard on the question as to whether c lauses 2.1 and 2.2 of Section II of the Tender Documents in respect of Eligibility Conditions had been complied with by aforesaid M s HFCL Bezeq.	None
Mr. Venugopal, the learned counsel appearing for the said respondent pointed out that 30.3.1995 was the date fixed for submission of the tenders which was later extended to 23.6.1995.	Arguments of Respondent
He further stated that the said respondent submitted different documents specified in clause 2.2 of Section II of the Tender Documents along with the bid and as such there has been full compliance of clauses 2.1 and 2.2.	Arguments of Respondent

Objections were also raised in respect of rates of charges for I.S.D. and S.T.D.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is not possible for this Court to issue specific directions o n those questions.	Arguments of Petitioner
It need not be pointed out that whenever a new policy is implemented there are teething problems.	Arguments of Petitioner
But they have to be sorted out.	None
On behalf of the petitioners, it was also submitted that neitherthere was any justification nor any national basis for debarring the Government Company from submitting their bids.	None
Although it is not necessary for this Court to express any opinion on that question because according to us that shall amount to a policy matter, but it can be said that the new Telecom Policy is based on privatization with foreign participation.	Arguments of Petitioner
Government undertakings like MTNL were already functioning in Delhi and Bombay and in spite of that it was felt that telecommunication should be handled by nonGovernment undertakings with foreign participation to improve the quality of service and to cover larger areas.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this background, there is no question of Government undertaking being ignored or discriminated while awarding the licences in different service circles.	None
