He however, in definite terms, denied that when he met the appellant and his mother together for the last time, there did not appear to be any strained feelings between them.35.	Facts
The testimony of the appellant on oath as DW2 is the replication of the defence version as already outlined and does not call for reiteration.	Facts
He however proved the two letters dated 28.2.2000 and 7.6.2000 written by the deceased to him and marked as Ex. D4 and D4A.	Facts

As the impugned judgement would disclose, the High Court took note amongst others of the factum of second marriage of the appellant with the lady Anna Darly as stated to be proved by the evidence adduced.	Facts
It also took note of the fact that the couple had gone for the divine retreat for a week by arranging the stay of the children at the ancestral house but returned early.	Facts
It disbelieved the testimony of DW1, the son of the appellant, construing it to be partisan in favour of the appellant in order to save him, in the circumstances.	Facts
His testimony was discarded as not of a prudent son otherwise expected to be sensitive to the death of his mother.	Facts
The High Court denounced the DW1 to be untruthful, for having expressing his ignorance about the second wife of the appellant Anna Darly.	Facts
It thus concluded that sans the evidence of DW1, there is nothing on record to demonstrate that the appellant did not accompany his wife to the house that evening, whereafter she was not found alive.39.	Facts
Apart from the last seen together index, the High Court accepted the other perceived incriminating circumstances against the appellant namely his illicit intimacy with Anna Darly, absence of explanation of his whereabouts after 7 P.M. till his presence in the shop of PW6 Mathew, recovery of broken bangles of the deceased from the dining room indicating a struggle, nail mark found on the forehead of the appellant suggesting resistance from the deceased and want of satisfactory explanation as to under what circumstances the deceased was found hanging in the house of the couple.40.	Facts
The High Court rejected the defence story of two persons pushing the appellant down on his way to his house in the evening and also commented on his conduct of not rushing to the house as a prudent husband and instead arranging for the conveyance of his brother to take him to the hospital even after being told that his wife had been found hanging in the house.	Facts
On a consideration of the totality of the circumstances, the High Court thus deduced that the death of Neena was homicidal and affirmed the conviction of the appellant as recorded by the Trial Court.	Facts
In this contentious backdrop, Mr. Basant has emphatically urged that in the absence of any eye witness of the occurrence and a convincing and complete chain of circumstantial evidence unerringly attesting the guilt of the appellant, his conviction for murder, in the teeth of the acquittal of the coaccused Benny, his brother, is patently illegal.	Arguments of Petitioner
Asserting that the evidence as a whole does unmistakably demonstrate that the deceased had committed suicide, the learned senior counsel has urged that the acquittal of the appellant and his coaccused of the charge under Section 498A IPC also belies the imputation of his extramarital association with the lady Darly as alleged by the prosecution.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, the narration in the first information report authored by PW1 and the statement of PW6 in the inquest report at the earliest point of time though authenticate the correct state of affairs, the attempt on the part of the investigating agency to improve thereon by rerecording of the statements of these witnesses along with that of PW7 was only to frame the appellant in particular at the behest of his inlaws.42.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any view of the matter, Mr. Basant has urged that the interrogation of these witnesses after time lag of almost four years and too on the eve of submission of the chargesheet, laysbare the stratagem of the investigating agency to prosecute him on otherwise unfounded allegations.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned senior counsel has insisted that not only the testimony of PW1, PW6, PW7 and PW20, the doctor who had performed the postmortem examination is consistent with the innocence of the appellant, it is apparent from the documentary evidence more particularly the letters Ex. D4 and D4A written by the deceased to him that there was a subsisting loving and affectionate relationship between them till the demise of the former.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has argued that the medical evidence having failed to convincingly prove that the deceased had died of homicidal hanging, the seizure of the nylon rope and broken pieces of bangles from under the cot of the adjoining dining room pales into insignificance.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been urged that the evidence of the son of the appellant, who was a major at the time of his deposition with the desired maturity of understanding, overwhelmingly establishes his innocence, there being no persuasive reason for the witness to lie in his favour and against his mother.43.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to Mr. Basant, the courts below grossly erred in discarding his evidence being unworthy of credit, branding him to be insensitive to the death of his mother and pretentious in faking ignorance of the lady named Anna Darly and her alleged extramarital relationship with the appellant.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned senior counsel has maintained that in absence of any concrete evidence of the alleged illicit nexus between the appellant and the lady named Anna Darly, his marriage with her did not ipso facto establish the imputation.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Basant has urged that the circumstantial evidence relied upon by the prosecution is incoherent and insufficient in form, continuity and content and falls short of the legally prescribed standards to return a finding of guilt on the basis thereof.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance has been placed on the decisions of this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra (1984)4 SCC 116 and R. Rajendran Nair vs. State of Kerala (1998) SCC (Crl.)	Arguments of Petitioner
254.	Arguments of Petitioner
In refutation, the learned counsel for the respondents has maintained that the circumstantial evidence available on the record does amply establish the complicity of the appellant in the gruesome murder of the deceased, his wife by strangulation with the aid of a nylon rope seized and then suspending her from the roof of the work area by using a saree as a ligature.	Arguments of Respondent
The guilt of the appellant, according to the learned state counsel, inter alia is unerringly deducible from his unusual conduct of not rushing back home even after being informed of the incident and instead in arranging for a conveyance for his brother to the hospital.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, he did not act as a prudent husband, even if his story of being pushed down by two strangers is believed in not hurrying back to his house to ensure the safety of his wife, the deceased.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been argued that deceased was seen alive last in the company of the appellant when they alighted from the bus at 7.30 p.m. in the same evening.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the learned state counsel, the testimony of DW1, the son of the appellant is wholly untrustworthy, it being partisan and untruthful and in that view of the matter, the mishap having occurred inside the house in which the couple used to live, the appellant, in absence of any explanation for the episode, has been rightly held to be guilty of the offence charged by both the courts below.	Arguments of Respondent
It has been argued that the medical evidence fully substantiates the charge of murder levelled against the appellant and the prosecution having been able to prove that the motive therefor being to eliminate the deceased in order to facilitate the consummation of the otherwise illicit relationship of his with Anna Darly, no interference with his conviction is warranted in the facts and circumstances of the case.	Arguments of Respondent
The fact that the appellant eventually married the said lady, amply establishes the charge as well, he urged.45.	Arguments of Respondent
The arguments exchanged have received our anxious consideration cumulatively with the evidence on record.	None
Admittedly there is no eyewitness to the incident.	None
The endeavour of the prosecution, however has been to demonstrate that after the couple had returned from Pota in the evening of the date of the episode, they returned home and thereafter the appellant had committed the murder of his wife Neena by first strangulating her with the nylon rope that was recovered from under the cot in the dining room and then had hanged her from the hook of the roof of the service area by using a saree as a ligature.	None
This inference, according to the prosecution, is inevitable from the attendant facts and circumstances.	None
The quality and the decisiveness of such evidence, therefore, would be of determinative relevance.	None
Aside the aspect that PWs 1, 6 and 7 had been examined twice by the investigating agency at the interval of almost four years, we have been left unconvinced by the peripheral variations in their statements so as to infer the complicity of the appellant on the basis of their attempted departure from their versions recorded at the earliest point of time.	None
Though these witnesses have been sought to be discredited by the prosecution visavis their earlier statements allegedly made at the behest of the appellant, the essence of their testimony qua the incident and the attendant facts and circumstances has remained the same barring a few inconsequential inconsistencies.	None
Noticeably, there is no reason forthcoming for reexamining these witnesses after almost four years and on the verge of the submission of the chargesheet.	None
The plea of false implication at the instance of the inimical members of the family of the deceased in this context thus assumes significance.	None
Suffice it to recount that the testimony of PWs 1, 6 and 7 would evince that when the persons sent by the appellant had reached the house of the appellant to fetch the medical records of his brother Benny, they found the door open and when the deceased did not respond to their call, they entered through the door and found her in a hanging posture with movements, whereupon they raised alarm for which the appellant and others rushed to the place and the body of the deceased was brought down by cutting the saree.	None
Though the conduct and the movements of the appellant prior thereto had been somewhat unusual and disoriented, the same per se in our estimate does not irrefutably establish his culpability.	None
The medical evidence as elaborated hereinabove also does not decisively establish the case to be of homicidal hanging.	None
The unchallenged expositions of the doctor performing the postmortem examination highlighting the absence of the characteristic attributes attendant on death due to homicidal hanging following strangulation further reinforce the possibility of suicide.	None
The absence of definite medical opinion about the homicidal death of the deceased in our comprehension is a serious set back to the prosecution.	None
The evidence of the eyewitnesses when considered in conjunction with the testimony of the doctor does not link the appellant directly or indirectly with the actual act leading to the unnatural death of the deceased.	None
In absence of any persuasive evidence to hold that at the relevant time the appellant was present in the house, it would also be impermissible to cast any burden on him as contemplated under Section 106 of the Evidence Act.	None
The consistent testimony of the appellant and his son to the effect that after alighting from the bus on their return from Pota, the deceased was made to accompany DW1 back home while the appellant did go in search of labourers for works in his compound on the next day and that thereafter till the time DW1 had departed for his ancestral house, the appellant did not return home, consolidates the defence plea of innocence of the appellant.	None
This version of the appellant and his son is in accord with the statement made by the appellant under Section 313 Cr.P.C. as well.	None
Though the courts below have dismissed the testimony of DW1 as untrustworthy, he having feigned ignorance about the lady Darly with whom his father allegedly had extra marital affairs and was construed to be partisan towards the appellant and insensitive to the death of his mother, we are unable to lend our concurrence to these reasonings.	None
This witness at the time of his deposition was a major with the required maturity in the lifes perspectives, and in our assessment expectedly would not have lied for the appellant, his father, only to see him through, though knowing him to be the real perpetrator of the crime.	None
This is more so when the deceased was his own mother.	None
The prosecution plea that the appellant had resigned from the service in the police department to move out to Jeddah Saudi Arabia with the intention to perpetuate his illicit association with the lady Darly thereat and that in a way he had deserted the deceased and the children, is also not borne out definitively by the materials on record.	None
On the other hand, a plain perusal of the letters Ex. D4 and Ex.D4A written by the deceased to the appellant while he was abroad, do not reveal anguished outbursts of a wife otherwise expected in such a situation or any fervent insistence for early return.	None
Instead the contents thereof reveal narration of mundane happenings of day to day life, emphasis on the need for his required stay thereat for enhanced savings together with somewhat intimate feelings expected of a married couple physically estranged by compulsion of circumstances.	None
The letters for the least, do not suggest any bitterness, disappointment, frustration and seething indignation of the deceased for the appellant being away at Jeddah Saudi Arabia and allegedly with the lady, Darly.	None
Instead there are traces of cheer for his expected return in near future.	None
The authenticity of these letters and also of the records relied upon by the defence to demonstrate that the appellant while abroad used to remit money for the sustenance of the family, has not been impeached.	None
On an overall consideration of the evidence available on record, it would be, in our view, wholly unsafe to hold the appellant guilty of the charge of murder of his wife by strangulating her with the nylon rope as seized and then hanging her from the roof with the saree to complete the act.	Reasoning
The circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution in our assessment falls short of the requirement in law to return a finding of guilt against the appellant without any element of doubt whatsoever.	Reasoning
The fact that both the accused persons had been exonerated of the charge of cruelty under Section 498A IPC and that the coaccused, who allegedly had assisted the appellant in the perpetration of the crime had been fully acquitted by the courts below of all the charges also takes away the wind from the sails of the prosecution.	Reasoning
It is a trite proposition of law, that suspicion however grave, it cannot take the place of proof and that the prosecution in order to succeed on a criminal charge cannot afford to lodge its case in the realm of may be true but has to essentially elevate it to the grade of must be true.	None
In a criminal prosecution, the court has a duty to ensure that mere conjectures or suspicion do not take the place of legal proof and in a situation where a reasonable doubt is entertained in the backdrop of the evidence available, to prevent miscarriage of justice, benefit of doubt is to be extended to the accused.	None
Such a doubt essentially has to be reasonable and not imaginary, fanciful, intangible or nonexistent but as entertainable by an impartial, prudent and analytical mind, judged on the touch stone of reason and common sense.	Reasoning
It is also a primary postulation in criminal jurisprudence that if two views are possible on the evidence available, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the one favourable to the accused ought to be adopted.	None
The facts as obtained in the present case present a jigsaw puzzle in which several frames are missing to permit an unreserved opinion of the complicity of the appellant.	None
The inalienable interface of presumption of innocence and the burden of proof in a criminal case on the prosecution has been succinctly expounded in the following passage from the treatise The Law of Evidence fifth edition by Ian Dennis at page 445	None
The presumption of innocence states that a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.	None
In one sense this simply restates in different language the rule that the burden of proof in a criminal case is on the prosecution to prove the defendants guilt.	None
As explained above, the burden of proof rule has a number of functions, one of which is to provide a rule of decision for the factfinder in a situation of uncertainty.	None
Another function is to allocate the risk of misdecision in criminal trials.	None
Because the outcome of wrongful conviction is regarded as a significantly worse harm than wrongful acquittal the rule is constructed so as to minimise the risk of the former.	None
The burden of overcoming a presumption that the defendant is innocent therefore requires the state to prove the defendants guilt.	None
The above quote thus seemingly concede a preference to wrongful acquittal compared to the risk of wrongful conviction.	None
Such is the abiding jurisprudential concern to eschew even the remotest possibility of unmerited conviction.	None
This applies with full force particularly in fact situations where the charge is the sought to be established by circumstantial evidence.	None
These enunciations are so well entrenched that we do not wish to burden the present narration by referring to the decisions of this Court in this regard.	None
Addressing this aspect, however, is the following extract also from the same treatise The Law of Evidence fifth edition by Ian Dennis at page 483 Where the case against the accused depends wholly or partly on inferences from circumstantial evidence, factfinders cannot logically convict unless they are sure that inferences of guilt are the only ones that can reasonably be drawn.	None
If they think that there are possible innocent explanations for circumstantial evidence that are not merely fanciful, it must follow that there is a reasonable doubt about guilt.	None
There is no rule, however, that judges must direct juries in terms not to convict unless they are sure that the evidence bears no other explanation than guilt.	None
It is sufficient to direct simply that the burden on the prosecution is to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt, or so that they are sure.	None
The very high standard of proof required in criminal cases minimises the risk of a wrongful conviction.	None
It means that someone whom, on the evidence, the factfinder believes is probably guilty, or likely to be guilty will be acquitted, since these judgements of probability necessarily admit that the factfinder is not sure.	None
It is generally accepted that some at least of these acquittals will be of persons who are in fact guilty of the offences charged, and who would be convicted if the standard of proof were the lower civil standard of the balance of probabilities.	None
Such acquittals are the price paid for the safeguard provided by the beyond reasonable doubt standard against wrongful conviction.	None
A reference in the passing however to the of quoted decision in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda (supra) construed to be locus classicus on the relevance and decisiveness of circumstantial evidence as a proof of the charge of a criminal offence would not be out of place.	None
The relevant excerpts from paragraph 153 of the decision is extracted herein below.	None
153.(2)	None
The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accusedthey should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty.(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency.	None
(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.	None
As recent as in Sujit Biswas vs. State of Assam (2013) 12 SCC 406 , this Court also in the contextual facts constituting circumstantial evidence ruled that in judging the culpability of an accused, the circumstances adduced when collectively considered must lead to the only irresistible conclusion that the accused alone is the perpetrator of a crime in question and the circumstances established must be of a conclusive nature consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.	None
In Dhan Raj Dhand vs. State of Haryana (2014) 6 SCC 745 , one of us (Hon. Ghose,J.) while dwelling on the imperatives of circumstantial evidence ruled that the same has to be of highest order to satisfy the test of proof in a criminal prosecution.	None
It was underlined that such circumstantial evidence should establish a complete unbroken chain of events so that only one inference of guilt of the accused would ensue by excluding all possible hypothesis of his innocence.	None
It was held further that in case of circumstantial evidence, each circumstance must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by independent evidence excluding any chance of surmise or conjecture.	None
Judged on the above parameters, we are of the unhesitant opinion that the evidence adduced by the prosecution constituting circumstantial evidence in support of the charge does not furnish an unassailable basis to hold the appellant guilty of the charge of murder levelled against him.	Reasoning
The facts and circumstances admit of a reasonable doubt in his favour.	None
The circumstances brought forth by the prosecution do not rule out in absolute terms the hypothesis of the innocence of the appellant.	None
We thus consider it to be wholly unsafe to maintain his conviction as recorded by the courts below.	Reasoning
We are therefore inclined to extend benefit of doubt to him.	Decision
The conclusions drawn by the courts below are not tenable on the basis of the evidence available.	Decision
The appeal is thus allowed and the conviction and sentence recorded by the courts below is hereby set aside.	Decision
The appellant be released from the jail forthwith if he is not required in any other case.	Decision
