Relief.	None
The Trial Court on evaluation of the entire evidence however held as follows Although the circumstances mentioned above clearly reveal that it is a case of broken marriage, however, there is no ground given in Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, where a decree of divorce can be founded on the proof of irretrievably broken marriage.	Facts
In this regard, I may cite a recent judgment of our own Honble High Court reported as Rupinder Kaur Vs.	Facts
Gurjit Singh Sandhu (19973) P.L.R. 553.	Facts
It is laid down in this decision that even if the marriage is assumed to have (illegible) for irretrievably, it is not ground to dissolve the marriage.	None
However, the situation reached between the parties is of the doing of the petitioner and it is well cherished principle laid down in Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act that a party cannot be permitted to take benefit of his own wrongs.	None
For the discussion made above and the conclusions reached thereon, I hold that the petitioner has been unsuccessful in proving the respondent to have treated him with cruelty of the nature as to entitle him to a decree of divorce.	None
It is however, proved on the other side that the petitioner had harassed the respondent for getting his demand and the demands of his parents fulfilled.	Facts
However, the respondent has prayed for no relief on that ground.	Facts
Issue No.1 is, therefore, decided against the petitioner while Issue No.2 is decided in favour of the respondent.	Facts
Aggrieved by the aforesaid findings the respondent filed F.A.O. No.16M of 2000 in the Punjab and Haryana High Court.	Facts
The Learned Single Judge independently examines the entire evidence and the material on the record.	Facts
Upon evaluation of the entire evidence the Learned Single Judge observed that both the parties are at fault.	Facts
According to the Learned Single Judge the wife had crossed Lakshman Rekha.	Facts
Apart from what was stated by the Trial Court, the Learned Single Judge notices that the wife had not only made allegations about the unnatural demands of the husband for sexual intercourse when she was pregnant	Facts
but she had also made an allegation that he had wanted to commit the act of sodomy with her which she resisted.	Facts
The Learned Single Judge concludes that the evidence led by the husband with regard to cruelty of the wife is not such that he can be granted a decree of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act.	Facts
At the same time, adverting to the behaviour of wife the Learned Single Judge observed as follows I have considered the contentions of the parties with reference to the documents and first of all I must say here that respondent had crossed Lakshman Rekha.	Facts
I do not deny that a woman has no rights after the lawful marriage.	Facts
She expects love and affection, financial and physical security, equal respect and lots more but at the same time, the wife must remain within the limits.	Facts
She should not perform her acts in such a manner that it may bring incalculable miseries for the husband and his family members She should not go to hat extent that it may be difficult for her to return from that point.	Facts
The final conclusion reached by the Learned Single Judge is as follows I have made an independent assessment of the oral evidence and am of the opinion that both the parties are at fault.	Facts
The respondent exceeded the limits of decency when she went to the extent of lodging a false FIR and when she tried to humiliate the appellant in the eye of his superiors by writing a very damaging letter Ex. PW2/1 without knowing its consequences.	Facts
In view of the aforesaid conclusions the Learned Single Judge granted the alternative relief to the husband by passing a decree for judicial separation under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act.	Facts
This decree was passed with the hope that the parties would ponder upon the situation and may be able to reunite for the welfare of the child.	Facts
If, on the other hand, the parties do not reconcile within the statutory period of one year it will be open to either of them to seek a decree of divorce.	Facts
Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment the wife went in appeal before the Division Bench in LPA No.1625/01.	Facts
The Division Bench noticed the extensive pleadings as well as the evidence led by the parties.	Facts
On a re evaluation of the evidence the Division Bench concluded that all efforts of reconciliation between parties have failed.	Facts
They have been living separately since 31.12.1992.	Facts
According to the Division Bench the marriage has irretrievably broken down.	Facts
The Division Bench sums up the entire matrimonial scene of the parties in the following words The allegations and counter allegations had flown thick and proper in this case.	Facts
To an extent these did receive support by the evidence led by the respective parties.	Facts
The learned Single Judge chose a middlepath by holding that both the parties were at fault and accordingly granted decree of judicial separation instead of divorce.	Facts
To what effect and what difference it has made to the lives of parties can not really be made out.	Facts
The parties are living separately since 31.12.1992.	Facts
Though not revealed from the record but we can assume that efforts must have been made for reconciliation between the parties at the trial and at the first appellate stage.	Facts
Both the parties continue to differ and have refused to patch up.	Facts
As noticed earlier, we also failed in our efforts to bring this matrimonial dispute to some agreed solution.	Facts
What is left of this marriage?	Facts
Both the parties though educated but are still standing firm on their respective stands.	Facts
They both seem to be totally unconcerned about their young child and have continued with their combatant attitude without any remorse.	Facts
This marriage, if we may say, has irretrievably broken down.	Facts
That of course cannot be a ground for granting divorce between this fighting couple.	Facts
No wonder, the Honble Supreme Court in a latest decision in Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli, 2006 (3) Scale 252 has made a recommendation to the executive to provide this as a legal ground for divorce.	Facts
Till the law is amended, we will remain handicapped to act even in those cases where one finds that a marriage just cannot work and existence thereof is nothing but an agony for both the parties.	Facts
We, as such, are required to decide if the allegations of cruelty made by the respondent were proved or not.	Facts
While reappreciating evidence the Division Bench notices the averments made by the wife in paragraphs 13 and 31 of the Statutory Complaint dated 10.12.1993 wherein she had stated as follows On 2.12.1991, my husband started behaving in a strange manner throwing the household articles and clothes all around in the room and also mimicking the sound different animals and some times barking like a dog.	None
I was not only stunned but also shocked because I had never seen a human being behaving that way even if very heavily drunk as he was most of the time I remained in his company.	Facts
I was not allowed to touch any thing which belong to him.	Facts
When I told my motherinlaw, she warned me to ensure that I obeyed all orders given to me, either my husband or in laws.	Facts
My health started deteriorating.	Facts
My mind was disturbed to the extreme.	Facts
Now another form of torture, unnatural sex.	Facts
He would thrust on me at odd hours.	Facts
I was no longer a human being but a slave to his wild passions.	Facts
It is also observed that the wife has not denied the aforesaid averments while giving her evidence.	Facts
She had in fact further elaborated the allegation of sodomy made by her in the complaint.	Facts
The conclusion recorded by the Division Bench is as follows We have given our thoughtful consideration to the while issue.	Facts
It cannot be disputed that the appellant had made the averments in paras 13 and 31 of the complaints, which have been reproduced above.	Facts
She has also not denied the same, rather while giving her evidence, she had further elaborated the allegations of sodomy made by her in the complaint.	Facts
Wife cannot deny that she had compared her husband to a barking dog that she also made allegations against him for having behaved in a strange manner.	Facts
She had also referred to him as heavy drunkard.	Facts
Even if we leave aside the other allegations as made by the husband, we think that describing husband as dog and mimicking as animals and making allegations of sodomy would be enough to say that these amounted to cruelty on her part towards her husband.	Facts
It cannot be denied that the wife had lodged various complaints and criminal proceedings against the respondenthusband.	Facts
FIR under sections 498A and 406 IPC was got registered by the wife.	Facts
Respondent husband, however, earned acquittal in this case.	Facts
Another complaint filed before the Police Station Civil Lines, Meerut ended in dropping of the proceedings.	Facts
Yet in another FIR got registered under Sections 417, 419 and 420 IPC, the respondenthusband was discharged.	Facts
The record also reveals that still another FIR was got registered under Sections 354 and 506 read with Section 34 IPC on 18.8.1999 against the father inlaw, an Advocate and son of an Advocate by the appellantwife.	Facts
We think that this conduct would exceed all bounds of moderation.	Facts
A daughterinlaw making an allegation against her old and infirm fatherinlaw for molesting her would certainly be an intolerable behaviour, which can be termed nothing but an act of immense cruelty for a son, who was none else than the husband of such complaintwife.	Facts
This FIR was quashed on 20.3.2002.	Facts
Seeing the cumulative effect of all these allegations, we would not have any hesitation to hold that the allegations of cruelty made by the respondenthusband stand established.	Facts
Since the allegation of cruelty made by the husband had been accepted, the Division Bench further observed as follows We would, accordingly, hold that the finding of the learned Single Judge in grating partial relief and that of the trial Judge in declining the relief of divorce cannot be sustained.	Facts
We would, accordingly, set aside both the judgments and hold that the cruelty alleged by the respondent husband stands proved.	Facts
As a result, we will dismiss the appeal and modify the judgment of the learned Single Judge to hold that the decree of divorce prayed by the respondenthusband is granted.	Facts
The aforesaid judgment has been challenged by the wife in the present appeal.	Facts
We have heard the counsel for the parties.	None
Ms. Kamini Jaiswal, appearing for the appellant, submitted that order passed by the High Court could not have been passed in an appeal filed by the wife.	Arguments of Petitioner
The husband had not filed any appeal.	Arguments of Petitioner
Both the courts below had given concurrent findings that that the allegations of the husband about cruelty of the wife have not been proved.	Arguments of Petitioner
These findings were based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence by the Trial Court as well as the learned Single Judge of the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Division Bench reversed the findings without any recording any independent reasons.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel made a reference to the observations of the Trial Court wherein it has been observed that averments made in paragraph 13 would not amount to calling her husband a dog.	Arguments of Petitioner
The District Judge had observed to say that a person started barking like a dog and that that person is a dog are two different things.	Arguments of Petitioner
In Para 13 of exh.	Arguments of Petitioner
PW2/1, the respondent only speaks about unhuman behaviour of her husband and she cannot be taken as addressing her husband as dog in this paragraph.	Arguments of Petitioner
19.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Trial Court also observed that the allegations made in paragraph 31 of the Statutory Complaint about unnatural sex cannot be equated with sodomy.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Trial Court also came to the conclusion that it is a case of broken marriage.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, in the absence of a ground under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act where a decree of divorce can be founded on the proof of irretrievable broken marriage, it would not be a ground to dissolve the marriage.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also pointed out that these findings were not rejected by the Appellate Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel on this short ground the judgment of the Division Bench is liable to be set aside.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Mr. Rajender Kumar, appearing for the husband submitted that the High Court possibly could not have granted the decree on the basis of irretrievable break down of marriage.	Arguments of Respondent
However, the High Court has granted the decree of divorce upon re appreciation of the evidence and recording an independent finding that the conduct of the wife amounts to cruelty which would entitle the husband to a decree of divorce.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the learned counsel substantial justice has been done between the parties and the judgment does not call for any interference.	Arguments of Respondent
It has also been pointed out by the learned counsel that, a petition was filed for divorce on the basis of the decree of judicial separation which had been granted by the learned Single Judge.	Arguments of Respondent
However proceedings in the aforesaid case have been kept in abeyance due to the pendency of the appeals in the High Court and this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel submitted that there is absolutely no room for reconciliation between the parties.	Arguments of Respondent
Therefore, the judgment of the High Court need not be reversed at this stage.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel.	Reasoning
The Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court have both concluded that the behaviour of the husband as well as the wife falls short of the standard required to establish mental cruelty in terms of Section 13(1) (ia).	Issue
At this stage we may notice the observations made by this Court in the case of Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli (2006) 4 SCC 558.	None
In this case the Court examined the development and evolution of the concept of mental cruelty in matrimonial causes.	None
In paragraph 35 it is observed as follows The petition for divorce was filed primarily on the ground of cruelty.	None
It may be pertinent to note that, prior to 1976 amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 cruelly was not a ground for claiming divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act.	None
It was only a ground for claiming judicial separation under Section 10 of the Act.	None
By the 1976 amendment, cruelty was made a ground for divorce and the words which have been omitted from Section 10 are as to cause a reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party.	None
Therefore, it is not necessary for a party claiming divorce to prove that the cruel treatment is of such a nature as to cause an apprehensionreasonable apprehension  that it will be harmful or injurious for him or her to live with the other party.	None
The classic example of the definition of cruelty in the pre1976 era is given in the well known decision of this Court in the case of N.G. Dastane vs. S. Dastane (1975) 2 SCC 326 , wherein it is observed as follows The enquiry has to be whether the conduct charged as cruelty is of such a character as to cause in the mind of the petitioner as reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious for him to live with the respondent.	None
This is no longer the required standard.	Reasoning
Now it would be sufficient to show that the conduct of one of the spouses is so abnormal and below the accepted norm that the other spouse could not reasonably be expected to put up with it.	Reasoning
The conduct is no longer required to be so atrociously abominable which would cause a reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious to continue the cohabitation with the other spouse.	Reasoning
Therefore to establish cruelty it is not necessary that physical violence should be used.	Reasoning
However continued illtreatment cessation of marital intercourse, studied neglect, indifference of one spouse to the other may lead to an inference of cruelty.	Reasoning
However in this case even with aforesaid standard both the Trial Court and the Appellate Court had accepted that the conduct of the wife did not amount to cruelty of such a nature to enable the husband to obtain a decree of divorce.	Reasoning
We may notice here the observations made by this Court in the case of Shobha Rani vs. Madhukar Reddi (1988) 1 SCC 105 wherein the concept of cruelty has been stated as under The word cruelty has not been defined in the Hindu Marriage Act.	None
It has been used in Section 13(1)(ia) of the Act in the context of human conduct or behaviour in relation to or in respect of matrimonial duties or obligations.	None
It is a course of conduct of one which is adversely affecting the other.	None
The cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or unintentional.	None
If it is physical, it is a question of fact and degree.	None
It if it mental, the enquiry must begin as to the nature of the cruel treatment and then as to the impact of such treatment on the mind of the spouse.	None
Whether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious to live with the other, ultimately, is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the nature of the conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse.	None
There may, however, be cases where the conduct complained of itself is bad enough and per se unlawful or illegal.	None
Then the impact or the injurious effect on the other spouse need not be enquired into or considered.	None
In such cases, the cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is proved or admitted.	None
The absence of intention should not make any difference in the case, if by ordinary sense in human affairs, the act complained of could otherwise be regarded as cruelty.	None
Intention is not a necessary element in cruelty.	None
The relief to the party cannot b e denied on the ground that there has been no deliberate or willful illtreatment.	None
In the case of V. Bhagat vs. D. Bhagat (1994) 1 SCC 337 , this Court while examining the concept of mental cruelty observed as follows Mental cruelty in Section 13(1)(ia) can broadly be defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the other party such mental pain and suffering as would make it not possible for that party to live with the other.	None
In other words, mental cruelty must be of such a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be expected to live together.	None
The situation must be such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with the other party.	None
It is not necessary to prove that the mental cruelty is such as to cause injury to the health of the petitioner.	None
While arriving at such conclusion, regard must be had to the social status, educational level of the parties, the society they move in, the possibility or otherwise of the parties ever living together in case they are already living apart and all other relevant facts and circumstances which it is neither possible nor desirable to set out exhaustively.	None
What is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another case.	None
It is a matter to be determined in each case having regard to the facts and circumstances of that case.	None
If it is a case of accusations and allegations, regard must also be had to the context in which they were made.	None
Taking into consideration the conduct of the parties over a period of time, the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court concluded that the husband had failed to establish cruelty on the part of the wife which will be sufficient to grant a decree of divorce.	None
The Appellate Court further came to the conclusion that since both the parties made extremely serious allegations, it would be appropriate as the parties were not compelled to live together.	None
The Appellate Court came to the conclusion that it would be more appropriate to give the couple some time to ponder over the issue especially keeping in view the welfare of their daughter.	None
If in due course they manage to reconcile their differences the decree of judicial separation would be of no consequence.	None
On the other hand, if the parties continued with their adamant attitudes it would be possible for either party to seek dissolution of the marriage on the basis of the aforesaid decree of judicial separation.	None
As noticed earlier the husband did not challenge the aforesaid decree of the Appellate Court, he was content to wait for one year and there after seeking decree of divorce.	Reasoning
In fact upon the expiry of one year he has actually filed the necessary proceedings seeking decree of divorce in the Court of District Judge, Gurgaon on 9.5.2002.	Reasoning
These proceedings are still pending.	None
On the other hand the wife had filed the Latest Patent Appeal challenging the grant of decree of judicial separation to the husband by the Appellate Court.	Reasoning
We are of the opinion that the High Court erred in granting a decree of divorce to the husband.	Reasoning
She had come in appeal before the Division Bench complaining that the Appellate Court had wrongly granted the decree of judicial separation even after concurring with the findings of the Trial Court that the husband had failed to establish cruelty by the wife.	Reasoning
Therefore even if the appeal had been dismissed, the findings recorded by the Trial Court in her favour would have remained intact.	Reasoning
The effect of the order passed by the Division Bench is as if an appeal of the husband against the decree of judicial separation has been allowed.	Reasoning
Both the parties had failed to make out a case of divorce against each other.	Reasoning
The husband had accepted these findings.	Reasoning
Therefore he was quite content to wait for the statutory period to lapse before filing the petition for divorce, which he actually did on 9.5.2002.	Reasoning
On the basis of the proven facts the Trial Court was more inclined to believe the wife, whereas the learned Single Judge of the High court found both the parties to be at fault.	Reasoning
Hence the middle path of judicial separation had been accepted.	Reasoning
Therefore, it was not a case where it was necessary for the Division Bench to correct any glaring and serious errors committed by the court below which had resulted in miscarriage of justice.	Reasoning
In our opinion there was no compelling necessity, independently placed before the Division Bench to justify reversal, of the decree of judicial separation.	Reasoning
In such circumstances it was wholly inappropriate for the Division of High Court to have granted a decree of divorce to the husband.	Reasoning
For the aforesaid reasons, we are unable to uphold the judgment and the decree of the Division Bench.	Decision
Consequently, we allow the appeal.	Decision
We set aside the Judgment and the Order passed by the Division Bench and restore the Order passed by the learned Single Judge in FAO No. 16M of 2000.	Decision
There shall be no order as to costs.	Decision
