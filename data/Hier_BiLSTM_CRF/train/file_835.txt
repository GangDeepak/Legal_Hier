In case extension is required it can be granted within the discretion of the lessor.	None
The transaction, in our opinion, is a grant (hereinafter referred to as GRANTI for the sake of convenience) covered by the Government Grants Act 1895.	None
We shall deal with the said Act and the reasons for our conclusion that the so called lease dated 18th March, 1969 is a grant in some detail later in this judgment.7.	Facts
Admittedly, the Appellant herein utilized an extent of about 200 acres of the abovementioned 350 acres of land for setting up (i) Alloy Tool and Special Steel Plant (ii) the Roll Foundry Project, the specified purpose for which the GRANTI was made to the Appellant.8.	Facts
In the year 1974, the State of Bihar made the ACT.	Facts
The object of the ACT is to provide for planned development of Industrial Areas and promotion of Industries and matters appurtenant thereto.	Facts
(The ACT was preceded by an Ordinance of 1972)	Facts
The ACT was adopted by the State of Jharkhand.9.	Facts
By a document dated 18.7.1973, the Governor of Bihar made another grant (hereinafter referred to as GRANTII for the sake of convenience) of an extent of 1266 acres of land, described in the Schedule attached to the said document, to the AUTHORITY to own, possess and hold the same for the purposes of the development of industries of that area Now, therefore, the Governor of the State of Bihar, the GRANTOR, does hereby make this grant of an area of land together with structures and appurtenance thereto measuring more or less 1266 acres, fully described in the schedule below UNTO the GRANTEE to own, possess and hold the same for the purposes of the development of industries of that area with powers to use the said lands for the purposes of development of industry in planned manner and in that connection to lease out pieces of lands structures and appurtenance thereto to entrepreneurs for a period of not exceeding 99 years on such terms and conditions as the Authority may deem fitAnd further whereas this grant is made subject to the condition that in the event of the GRANTEE ceasing to function or in the event of the lands hereby granted being of no use for the purposes for which the grant is made, the lands granted will automatically revert to the GRANTOR and the GRANTEE will be divested of all the rights, title and interest would get vested in the GRANTOR but subject to the rights created in the entrepreneurs and further subject to the condition that the GRANTEE would abide by the instructions of the Government from time to time.	Facts
By a letter dated 01.09.2000 of Respondent No. 3, the Appellant herein was called upon to surrender an extent of 150 acres of land on the ground that out of 350 acres of land leased to the Appellant, about 150 acres of land was still lying vacant for more than 25 years and there was demand for land from other entrepreneurs for setting up industries.	Facts
After some correspondence in this regard, Respondent No. 3 issued notice dated 15.01.2002 asking the Appellant herein to show cause why action Under Section 6(2a) of the ACT and Clause 4 (xiv) of the lease deed (GRANTI) be not taken for resuming 150 acres of land which remained unutilized.	Facts
Thereafter, there was lot of correspondence between the parties, the details of which are not necessary.11.	Facts
On 17.11.2008, Respondent No. 3 passed an order purporting to cancel the allotment of 100 acres out of 150 acres of land lying vacant in the possession of Appellant and terminating the GRANTI interestingly without any qualification with regard to the extent.	Facts
The relevant part of the order reads as follows Clearly, Tata Steel has failed to utilize the allotted land even after the lapse of almost 40 years and is only trying to keep the land in its custody thus denying the opportunity of land allotment to other entrepreneurs.	Facts
Mentionable, that all the small and medium sector units located in AIADA area are governed by the same rules for setting up the industries and utilization of the land.	Facts
Hence there appears to be no reason for any special consideration to be given to the Tata Steel for violating the conditions of lease.	Facts
However, taking considerate and liberal view of the whole issue and also the allround performance of TISCO LTD and finally the Jharkhand Industrial Development Authority Act and provisions of allotment and lease deed and by the powers confirmed upon me Under Section 6 sub Clause 2(a) 2(b) of Jharkhand Industrial Area Development Authority allotment of 100 acres of land out of 150 acres lying unutilized and vacant is cancelled, lease terminated and cost forfeited.	Facts
Further the unit is directed to utilize the remaining portion of vacant land within six months failing which necessary action would be taken to cancel the land.	Facts
A copy of this order may be sent to the company.	Facts
Aggrieved by the order dated 17.11.2008, the Appellant herein filed Writ Petition No. 6042 of 2008 in the High Court of Jharkhand.	Facts
By the impugned judgment, the writ petition was dismissed, holding A bare perusal of SubClause(iv) will clearly indicate that it deals with two subjects one is based on the requirement of the State Government or its successor which may require for resuming the lease or part of the lease for public purpose.	Facts
Here in this case the proceeding was not initiated under this provisions as it is not the case of the Government lessor that the Government requires the land in question for any public purpose.	Facts
The lessor has started proceeding for eviction of the lessee under proviso to Subclause (iv) of Condition 4 because of nonuse of the part of the lease land therefore, in view of the proviso to Clause (iv) of the lease condition No. 4 of Part II of the lease, the lessor had right to proceed for determining the lease of the part of the property which has not been utilized for the purpose for which it was acquired by the lessee on lease.	Facts
Hence, the appeal.	None
The following principal submissions are made before us on behalf of the Appellant That, in view of the GRANTI the State of Bihar could not have made GRANTII in favour of the AUTHORITY without first resuming the lands covered by GRANTI.(ii) That, GRANTII dated 18.7.1973 does not include the land which is subject matter of GRANTI between the Appellant and the State of Bihar.(iii)	Arguments of Petitioner
Assuming for the sake of argument that the land in occupation of the Appellant is also a part of the GRANTII, the AUTHORITY can only exercise such rights as are available to it as a successorininterest of the State of Bihar under the GRANTI.	Arguments of Petitioner
The third Respondent could not invoke the powers conferred under the ACT insofar as the lands which are in occupation of the Appellant are concerned.(iv)	None
The sources of legal authority relied upon for taking the impugned action against the Appellant, the showcause notice dated 15.01.2002 and the final order dated 17.11.2008 purporting to cancel the allotment and terminate the GRANTI are different.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, there is a denial of reasonable opportunity to the Appellant to effectively represent its case before the AUTHORITY.(v)	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court justified the impugned order dated 17.11.2008 on a totally new ground not relied upon either in the showcause notice or the final order i.e. violation of Subclause (xiv) of condition No. 4 contained in PartII of GRANTI.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such a process is impermissible in law as the same would have the effect of denying a reasonable opportunity to the Appellant to effectively win the case.(vi)	None
It is submitted that Subclause (xiv) of condition No. 4 authorizes the AUTHORITY to terminate the lease and evict the lessee from the land only on the failure of the lessee to use the land for the specified purpose within a period of one year from the date of the GRANTI.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Appellant used the land for the purpose specified in the GRANTI within a period of one year.	None
Therefore, Subclause (xiv) of the Condition No. 4 could not be invoked.(vii)	Arguments of Petitioner
There is no requirement in the covenants contained in PartII of GRANTI that every inch of the land leased to the Appellant is required to be utilized by making construction and establishing industries thereon.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Respondents argued that there is no need to interfere with the impugned judgment as it is a well reasoned judgment in support of the conclusion recorded by the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Before we proceed to examine various submissions made by the Appellant, it is necessary to examine I. the character of the two documents i.e. lease deed dated 18.03.1969 (GRANTI) and the grant dated 18.07.1973 (GRANTII) referred to earlier andII.	None
the Scheme of the ACT insofar as it is relevant for our purpose It is almost becoming a forgotten proposition of law that the Government is not bound by the Transfer of Property Act 1882, when it seeks to transfer any land vested in it or any interest therein.	None
It may not be possible to trace out the entire history of the vesting of lands in the Government and the legal rights and obligations flowing from such vesting as it is a huge topic by itself.	None
It is sufficient to state that Articles 294 (294.	None

None
provides for the succession to the property and assets which vested prior to the commencement of the Constitution in any Indian State (Article 366(15).	None
Indian State means any territory which the Government of the Dominion of India recognised as such a State.).	None
Article 296 (296.	None

Nothing in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 contained shall apply or be deemed ever to have applied to any grant or other transfer of land or of any interest therein heretofore made or hereafter to be made by or on behalf of the Government to or in favour of any person whomsoever but every such grant and transfer shall be construed and take effect as if the said Act had not been passed.)	None
of the Government Grants Act declares that nothing contained in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 applies to any grant or other transfer of land or any interest therein made by or on behalf of the Government either prior to or after the commencement of the said Act.	None
In other words, when Government transfers land or any interest therein to any person, such a transfer is not governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.	None
The rights and obligations flowing from the transfer of either a piece of land or an interest therein by the Government cannot be determined on the basis of the rights and obligations specified under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.	None

The combined effect of the above two sections of the Grants Act is that terms of any grant or terms of any transfer of land made by a Government would stand insulated from the tentacles of any statutory law.	None
Section 3 places the terms of such grant beyond the reach of any restrictive provision contained in any enacted law or even the equitable principles of justice, equity and good conscience adumbrated by common law if such principles are inconsistent with such terms.	None
The two provisions are so framed as to confer unfettered discretion on the Government to enforce any condition or limitation or restriction in all types of grants made by the Government to any person.	None
In other words, the rights, privileges and obligations of any grantee of the Government would be completely regulated by the terms of the grant, even if such terms are inconsistent with the provisions of any other law.	None
In the light of the above legal position, the rights and obligations created by GRANTSI II are regulated only by the terms of the documents by which those grants were made.	None

Reasoning
on the other hand expressly confers on the Authority certain powers enumerated in the various sections of the Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act, 1922 with regard to the development area.	None
Remaining Subsections deal with other matters, the details of which are not necessary for the present purpose, except noticing that the duties and powers of the Authorities are not common with respect to industrial area and development area under the Act.25.	None
It is in the background of the abovementioned Scheme of the Act, the various issues involved in this appeal are required to be examined.	Reasoning
The second Respondent AUTHORITY was constituted by notification dated 29.06.1972 under the Ordinance which preceded the ACT.	Reasoning
By GRANTII dated 18.7.1973, the Government of Bihar transferred an area of 1266 acres of land alongwith structures, appurtenance etc.	Reasoning
in favour of the AUTHORITY to own, possess and hold the same for the purposes of the development of industries of that area.	Reasoning
The Appellant disputes that the land transferred to them under GRANTI is not part of the abovementioned 1266 acres of land.	Reasoning
The second Respondent AUTHORITY asserts to the contra.	Reasoning
However, the High Court ((Para 20.	Reasoning
Learned Counsel for the AIADA vehemently submitted that the question of identity of the property which has been handed over to the AIADA or the plea that the lease land of the Petitioner is not included in the notification was never raised by the Petitioner before any authority even after several notices to the Petitioner and, therefore, this question of fact cannot be raised in the writ jurisdiction that too, without laying down the factual foundation for which particularly the Petitioner did not even annex the map which was part of the lease deed by which the lease was granted to the writ Petitioner, reference of which map is already there in the lease deed.))	Reasoning
declined to go into that question on the ground that it is a question of fact which was never raised by the Appellant herein any time earlier.	Reasoning
We see no reason to take a different view.26.	Reasoning
We, therefore, proceed on the basis that the land in dispute is part of the 1266 acres of the land covered by the GRANTII dated 18.7.1973.	Reasoning
But the question still remains whether the land in question is a part of either the industrial area or the development area or beyond both the areas.	Reasoning
We do not find any material on the record to reach any definite conclusion on the above question.	Reasoning
It goes without saying that the responsibility to establish that fact is on the Respondents by producing the appropriate notification.	Reasoning
Unfortunately, none is produced.	Reasoning
Therefore, we proceed on the presumption that the land in dispute is not part of any notified industrial or development area.	Reasoning
The power (legal authority) of the second Respondent AUTHORITY to deal with any land can flow from two sources, the statutory powers conferred on it under various provisions of the ACT over the areas notified under the ACT to be either industrial area or development area.	None
We have already noticed even with the reference to those two categories, the powers and functions of the second Respondent AUTHORITY are not common and(ii) holding of land  The AUTHORITY is a body corporate by virtue of Section 3(2) (3Section 3(2).	None
The Authority shall be a body corporate by name aforesaid having perpetual succession and a common seal with powers to acquire, hold and dispose of properties, both movable and immovable, and to contract and shall by the said name sue and be sued.)	None
of the ACT.	None
(It is capable of holding and disposing of properties both movable and immovable and the expression holding can mean holding either as owner or lessee or mortgagee etc.).	None
Such right to hold immoveable property extends to holding of such property even beyond the areas which are notified under the ACT either as industrial area or development area.	None
From the tenor of GRANTII, the powers of the second Respondent AUTHORITY are said to be the powers to use the said lands for the purposes of development of industry in planned manner and in that connection to lease out pieces of lands, structures and appurtenance thereto to entrepreneurs for a period of not exceeding 99 years on such terms and conditions as the Authority may deem fit.	None
It is obvious from the language of GRANTII that the second Respondent AUTHORITY is conferred with the right to lease out pieces of land for the purpose of development of industry.	None
But, such right enables the AUTHORITY to lease out pieces of land only from a date subsequent to the date of GRANTII (i.e. 18.07.1973) because a nonsovereign body cannot create or destroy rights with retrospective effect.	None
However, the right of the second Respondent AUTHORITY over the land transferred to it to own, possess and hold the same for the purposes of the development of industries of that area, can only be subject to the preexisting legal rights and obligations of the grantor because the grantor could not convey any interest which the grantor did not hold at the time of the GRANTII.	None
The State of Bihar created a legal interest in favour of the Appellant herein and parted with possession of the land in dispute by virtue of GRANTI for a specified period.	None
Without determining such a legal interest created by GRANTI in accordance with law, neither the grantor (State of Bihar) nor the subsequent grantee under GRANTII (the AUTHORITY) could create a fresh lease.	None
Because a lease in the context of the AUTHORITY can only be a lease contemplated under the Transfer of Property Act, which in the context necessarily requires possession of land to be given to the lessee by the lessor.	None
The first submission made on behalf of the Appellant is that a transfer of land such as the once evidenced by GRANTII could not have been legally made insofar as the property in dispute is concerned without the State of Bihar first resuming the lands which are in the possession of the Appellant pursuant to GRANTI.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the said submission is required to be rejected for the reason that though the State of Bihar did not have possession of the land in dispute when it made the GRANTII in favour of the AUTHORITY, the second grantee (i.e. the AUTHORITY) takes the property covered by the GRANTII subject to the rights of the earlier grantee.	Reasoning
There is no need in law for the termination of the interest created under GRANTI in favour of the Appellant, before the State of Bihar chose to transfer the property covered by the GRANTII.	None
Because the interest created under GRANTI was a limited interest and the title of the property still vested with the State of Bihar.30.	None
The next submission that is required to be examined iswhether the second Respondent AUTHORITY can exercise the power vested in it by the ACT visvis the lands in dispute as the said land is held by it only by virtue of GRANTII.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have already recorded that there is nothing on record to establish that the land in question is part of either industrial area or development area.31.	None
This question assumes importance because the showcause notice dated 15.01.2002 issued by the AUTHORITY invokes the powers both Under Section 6(2a) of the ACT and Clause 4 (xiv) of GRANTI and the final order dated 17.11.2008 relied upon Clause 4(xiv) of GRANTI and Section 6(2)(a) and 2(b) of the ACT.	Reasoning
It is necessary to identify the source of power which authorizes the second Respondent AUTHORITY to recover possession of 100 acres of land from the Appellant.	None
Because depending upon the source, the consequences and the procedure by which such recovery of possession can be made varies.	None
The power to terminate the lease in exercise of the statutory power Under Section 6(2a) can be resorted to only in one contingency that is necessary effective steps are not taken within the fixed period to establish the industry.	None
Section 6(2) ((6(2)	None
The Authority shall be responsible for planning, development and maintenance of the Industrial Area and amenities thereto and allotment of land, execution of lease and cancellation of such allotment or lease, realisation of fees, rent charges and matters connected thereto.))	None
authorizes the second Respondent AUTHORITY to make an allotment of land and execute a lease deed.	None
It also authorises the Authority to cancel such allotment or lease, obviously meaning allotments and leases made by the AUTHORITY.	None
In our opinion, the expression allotment in the context only means a formal administrative decision of the AUTHORITY to lease a particular piece of land in favour of an applicant who is desirous of establishing industry thereon.	None
Once such a decision is taken the second Respondent AUTHORITY can transfer an interest in such a piece of land by way of a lease.	None
The expression lease in the context of Subsection (2) can only mean a lease as defined under the Transfer of Property Act because the Government Grants Act does not apply to instrumentalities and bodies corporate controlled by the State.	None
A lease of immovable property granted for the agricultural or manufacturing purposes is terminable only in the manner indicated Under Section 106 ((Section 106.	None
Duration of certain leases in absence of written contract or local usage.	None
In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to year, terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by six months notice and a lease of immovable property for any other purpose shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by fifteen days notice.)(2)	None
Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the period mentioned in Subsection (1) shall commence from the date of receipt of notice.(3)	None
A notice Under Subsection (1) shall not be deemed to be invalid merely because the period mentioned therein falls short of the period specified under that Subsection, where a suit or proceeding is filed after the expiry of the period mentioned in that Subsection.(4)	None
Every notice Under Subsection (1) must be in writing, signed by or on behalf of the person giving it, and either be sent by post to the party who is intended to be bound by it or be tendered or delivered personally to such party, or to one of his family or servants at his residence, or (if such tender or delivery is not practicable) affixed to a conspicuous part of the property.)

A lease of immoveable property determines(a) by efflux of the time limited thereby(b) where such time is limited conditionally on the happening of some eventby the happening of such event(c) where the interest of the lessor in the property terminates on, or his power to dispose of the same extends only to, the happening of any eventby the happening of such event(d) in case the interests of the lessee and the lessor in the whole of the property become vested at the same time in one person in the same right(e) by express surrender that is to say, in case the lessee yields up his interest under the lease to the lessor, by mutual agreement between them(f) by implied surrender(g) by forfeiture that is to say, (1) in case the lessee breaks an express condition which provides that, on breach thereof, the lessor may reenter or (2) in case the lessee renounces his character as such by setting up a title in a third person or by claiming title in himself or (3) the lessee is adjudicated an insolvent and the lease provides that the lessor may reenter on the happening of such event and in any of these cases the lessor or his transferee gives notice in writing to the lessee of his intention to determine the lease(h) on the expiration of a notice to determine the lease, or to quit, or of intention to quit, the property leased, duly given by one party to the other.)	None
of the Transfer of Property Act specifies various contingencies in which a lease of immovable property determines.	None
Subsection (h) stipulates that expiration of a notice to determine the lease duly given by the lessor (in compliance with the requirements of Section 106) is one of such contingencies but Transfer of Property Act does not authorize the lessor to physically recover possession of the property on the determination of the lease.	None
The lessor is still required to approach the competent court for the recovery of the possession of the property over which the lease is terminated.	None
Section 6(2b) ((6(2b)The authority shall, after cancellation of allotment of the plot shed take possession of the said plot shed.)	None
)	None
of the ACT on the other hand authorizes the second Respondent AUTHORITY to take possession of the property which it had allotted and leased out earlier in exercise of the power Under Subsection (2).	None
Subsections (2a) and (2b) do not make any mention of the termination of lease.	None
They only speak of the cancellation of allotment made which to our mind clearly indicates that the cancellation of allotment and taking of possession of the plot shed can be resorted to only in the case of allotment made by the second Respondent AUTHORITY.	None
In the cases of property transferred by the State (prior to the ACT by whatever name such transfer is called) can be dealt with by the second Respondent AUTHORITY only in terms of the original document by which the property was transferred because such a transfer is a grant within the meaning of Government Grants Act, i.e. GRANTI insofar as the Appellant is concerned.	None
We therefore conclude that the AUTHORITY is entitled to deal with the land in question only as a grantee under the GRANTII dated 18.07.1973 and holder of the land.	None
In the light of our above conclusion, it is necessary for us to examine the terms of GRANTI made in favour of the Appellant herein (the so called lease dated 18.03.1969).	None
Clauses (iv), (v), (xiv) and (xvii) of Condition No. 4 of the Terms and Conditions of the lease are relevant in this context, which read as follows That if subsequently any part or parts of the said land is are required by the State Government for a public purpose, (of which matter).	None
the State Government shall be the sole judge, the lessee shall on being asked by the State Government transfer to them such part or parts of the said land as the State Government shall specify, to be necessary for the purpose aforesaid and in consideration of such transfer the State Government shall pay back to the lessee a sum proportionate or equal as the case may be, to the cost of land and its development if any earlier realized from him, together with compensation for the buildings and other structures erected with approval in writing of the lessor or its nominee on such part or parts of the land at a valuation to be determined by the State Government on a report from a Civil Engineer authorized in this behalf and the decision of the State Government will not be questioned by any authorityProvided that for the purpose of this Subclause the State Government would be entitled to resume only such part or parts of the land leased out to the lessee as were not actually being used for the purposes of the manufacture or are not essentially required for any purpose connected with the Industry.(v)	None
If at any time the said land or any part or parts thereof shall no longer be required by the lessee for the purpose for which it is leased out to him.	None
the lessee shall, while selling or assigning the said land or such part or parts, thereof as aforesaid first make an offer of the same to the State Government at a price proportionate or equal, as the case may be, to the cost of the land and its development, of any realized earlier from him, and he shall not make any sale or assignment thereof to any other party unless such offer shall have been declined by the State Government.	None
When such offer has been made by the lessee the State Government may accept of in respect of such part or parts of the land so offered as it may deem fit and decline it in respect of the remainder.	None
When the first offer of selling or assigning said land or such part or parts thereof as aforesaid has been declined by the State Government, the lessee, while selling or assigning the said land or such part or parts thereof as aforesaid to any other party shall do so with prior approval of the State Government.(xiv) That the lessee shall use the land for the specified purpose within a period of one year from the date of the lease, failing which the lease may be terminated and the lessee evicted from the lands without notice.	None
In case extension is required it can be granted within the discretion of the lessor.(xvii)	None
In case of breach by the lessee of any of the terms and conditions, the lessor shall have right to resume and enter upon the whole of the said land without payment of any compensation to the lessee and upon such a reentry the interest of the lessee in the said land shall cease and determine.	None
It can be seen from the above extracted clauses of GRANTI that under condition 4(iv)	None
the Appellant is obliged to transfer to the grantor (the state of Bihar or its successor in interestthe AUTHORITY) such parts of the land required by the AUTHORITY when the AUTHORITY requires the same for a public purpose.	None
It is further stipulated that in the event of any such demand by the AUTHORITY, the AUTHORITY is required to pay to the Appellant certain amounts.	None
Thirdly, such power cannot be exercised even for a public purpose with reference to that portion of land which is either actually being used for the purposes of the manufacture or essentially required for any purpose connected with the industry.	None
Condition No. 4(v) recognizes the right of the Appellant to sell or assign the said land.	None
On a true and proper construction of the clause, such a right to sell or assign obviously means only the right to see the interest created in favour of the Appellant under GRANTI and nothing beyond that.	None
Whenever the Appellant chooses either to sell or assign such interest in any part of the land covered by the GRANT I, the Appellant is required to make an offer to the AUTHORITY at a price described in the said clause.	None
Unless such an offer is declined by the AUTHORITY, the Appellant cannot sell or assign its interest to a third party.	None
Further, such sale or assignment cannot be made by the Appellant without the prior approval of the AUTHORITY.	None
Condition No. 4(xiv) authorizes the AUTHORITY to terminate the lease and evict the Appellant without notice if the Appellant does not use the land for the purpose specified in the lease within a period of one year from the date of lease.	Arguments of Petitioner
Condition No. 4(xvii) authorizes the AUTHORITY to resume and enter upon the land covered by the lease in the event of a breach by the Appellant of the terms and conditions of the GRANT I.	None
The substance of the four clauses is that Appellant would be obliged to transfer the property by virtue of Condition No. 4(iv) when a part of the property covered by GRANTI is needed for a public purpose.	Reasoning
Such stipulation perhaps implies an obligation on the part of the Appellant to give possession of the property without the need for the State to resort to a civil court for recovering the possession.	Reasoning
We do not wish to give any final opinion in this regard as this issue does not arise in this case and not argued before us.	Reasoning
In the contingency contemplated under Condition No. 4 (v), since it would be a transfer at the instance of the Appellant, obviously the question of the mode of recovery of possession does not arise as it would be a voluntary act of the Appellant.	Reasoning
On the other hand, in the contingencies contemplated under condition Nos. 4 (xiv) and 4 (xvii), the language of the grant expressly authorizes the AUTHORITY to evict the lessee from the lands or resume and enter upon the whole of the land.	Reasoning
Whether such right to evict or resume, of the AUTHORITY includes the right to recover possession without the need to resort to a civil suit is also a question we need not decide in this case as that issue does not arise.40.	Reasoning
We have discussed the Scheme of GRANTI dated 18.03.1969 only to indicate the difference between the nature of the rights of the AUTHORITY against the Appellant because we have already recorded a conclusion that the AUTHORITY cannot invoke any statutory powers flowing from the ACT against the Appellant and could only exercise such rights that are available to it under the GRANTI.	None
We have already set out the four clauses under GRANTI in paragraph 34 supra which deal with the termination of the grant made in favour of the Appellant.	Reasoning
The only clause, invoked in the show cause notice dated 15.1.2002 of the AUTHORITY is Clause (xiv).42.	Reasoning
Even the Respondents do no claim that the impugned action could be justified under the other three clauses.	Reasoning
Clause (xiv) purports to enable the AUTHORITY to terminate the GRANTI and evict the Appellant in only one contingency.	Reasoning
At the cost of repetition, we extract Clause (xiv) again That the lessee shall use the land for the specified purpose within a period of one year from the date of the lease, failing which the lease may be terminated and the lessee evicted from the lands without notice.	Facts
In case extension is required it can be granted within the discretion of the lessor.	None
Clause (xiv) stipulates that in the event of the Appellant failing to use the land for the specified purpose within a period of one year from the date of the lease (GRANTI), the same may be terminated and the Appellant be evicted from the lands without notice.	Reasoning
It is an undisputed fact that the Appellant was given the land in dispute for the purpose of establishing alloy tool and special steel plants and the roll foundry project.	Reasoning
That is the purpose specified under the GRANT.	Reasoning
Admittedly, the Appellant utilized 200 acres of land out of 350 acres of land for the establishment of the said project.	Reasoning
The question is whether Clause (xiv) obligates the Appellant to utilise every inch of the 350 acres for the specified purpose within a period of one year.	None
Whether the Appellant is liable to be evicted from a portion of the land on the ground that portion of the land is not physically utilised for the specified purpose?44.	Issue
In our view, the answer must be in the negative for the following reasons To understand the meaning and scope of Clause (xiv), the following factors are required to be examined (i) purpose for which the GRANT was made, (ii) the terms and conditions upon which the GRANT was made, (iii) the various contingencies under which the GRANT could be terminated in full or in part etc.	Reasoning
(iv) the scheme of the GRANT.(ii)	Reasoning
The land in dispute was transferred to the Appellant for a specific purpose under GRANTI.	None
The Appellant did in fact establish the industry for the establishment of which the GRANTI was made and has been successfully running the industry for the last about 40 years (approximately).	None
For the said purpose, the Appellant utilised a substantial portion of the land covered by the GRANT and therefore, it cannot be said that the Appellant did not utilise the land for the purpose specified under the GRANTI.	Reasoning
Such a GRANT was made for a consideration (Salami of Rs. 24,48,670/) apart from an annual rent for the land which the Appellant has admittedly been paying.(iii)	Reasoning
Analysis of the scheme of Clauses (iv), (v), (xiv) and (xvii), reveals that only Clauses (iv) and (v) speak about any part or parts of the land which the Appellant is liable to transfer on demand by the AUTHORITY under Clause (iv) or voluntarily under Clause (v).	Reasoning
Clause (xvii) stipulates the right of the second Respondent to resume and enter upon the whole of the said land in the event of breach by the Appellant of any of the terms and conditions of GRANTI, whereas Clause (xiv) significantly does not employ the expression part or parts of the land.(iv)	Reasoning
Clause (xiv) does not contemplate taking possession of parts of the land in contradistinction to Clauses (iv) and (v).	Reasoning
It only contemplates the termination of the GRANTI in the event of the failure on the part of the Appellant to use the land for the specified purpose and eviction of the Appellant from the land.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the language of the clause is significant.	Reasoning
It can only be invoked in the case of total failure to utilise the land for the specified purpose.	Reasoning
Clause (xiv) read with the right of the Appellant under Clause (v) to sell a part of the land covered by the GRANTI which is no longer required by him, can lead to only one conclusion that it was never intended by the GRANTI that every inch of the land must be utilised for the purpose of the establishment of the industry.	Reasoning
Any other construction of Clause (xiv) would simply render the Clause (v) meaningless and destructive of the right created thereunder in favour of the Appellant.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the second Respondent is not entitled to invoke Clause (xiv) in support of its impugned decision.	Reasoning
In view of the above conclusion, the other submission of the Appellant need not be examined.	Reasoning
The appeal is allowed.	Decision
The impugned judgment is set aside.	Decision
Consequentially, the writ petition is allowed and the order dated 17.11.2008 of the third Respondent is quashed.	Decision
No order as to costs.	Decision
