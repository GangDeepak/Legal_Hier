 SIKRI J. 1.	None
These two appeals by certificate granted by the High Court of Kerala are directed against the judgment of the High Court passed in Appeal No. 1067 of 1959, which arose out of Original Suit filed in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Cochin.	Issue
Civil Appeal No. 100 of 1966 is by M. J. Kanaka Bai and others (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiffs ), and Civil Appeal No. 101 of 1966 is by the Union of India (hereinafter referred to as the defendant )	Issue
In order to appreciate the contentions raised before us, it is necessary to set out the following facts One Shri A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi, father of the two plaintiffs, was carrying on a joint Hindu family business under the name and style of A. N. Guna Shenoi and Bros. in the former State of Cochin.	Facts
At the relevant time, the Cochin Excess Profits Tax Act 1117 M.E. (II of 1117 M.E.) (1941 A.D.) and Cochin Incometax Act, 1117 M. E. (VI of 1117 M.E.) were in force in the Cochin State.	Facts
Cochin later became part of the State of TravancoreCochin.	Facts
On the commencement of the Constitution, the latter State became a Part B State in the Union of India.	Facts
The Government of India on May 20, 1951, issued a notification giving certain terms to assessees if they disclosed their hidden income or income which had escaped taxation.	Facts
We are not concerned with the exact concessions given but only with the question whether this notification was also concerned with the assessment under the Excess Profits TaxAct.	Facts
Our attention was invited by the plaintiffs to the opening sentence of the notification, which is as follows Detailed measures for launching a special drive for the clearance of arrears of incometax have now been finalised by the Government of India.	Facts
It was also pointed out that only Incometax Officers were mentioned in various parts of the notification and no reference was made to Excess Profits Tax Officers.	Facts
In pursuance of this notification, A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi made two statements dated August 30, 1951, and October 22, 1951, disclosing income of the joint family business from 111115 M.E. (1939) to end of 1122 M.E. (1946) to the extent of Rs. 3, 70, 000 which had escaped assessment to incometax in those years.	Facts
In the disclosure dated October 22, 1951, it was stated that a portion of these profits amounting to Rs. 81, 759 has already been taxed in the assessments for the years 1116 and 1117 and a sum of Rs. 30, 000 was added back to the disclosed profits in the year 1123.	Facts
In paragraph 7 of the disclosure statement dated October 22, 1951, it was stated I request that I may be allowed to pay the aggregate tax due by me in twenty monthly instalments as I am not in a position to command the cash necessary for paying the whole of the deficient tax that may be due by me in a lump.	Facts
He further requested that certain investigations being carried on against him in respect of the assessment years 1121, 1122 and 1123 be dropped.	Facts
Various amounts were paid by the said A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi under four challans dated March 23, 1952, February 25, 1953, March 27, 1953, and August 25, 1953, totalling Rs. 1, 04, 688130 towards payment of incometax on the disclosed income as a result of reassessment for the years 1119, 1120, 1121, 1122 and 1123 (i.e., 194344, 194445, 194546, 194647 and 194748).	Facts
It may be mentioned that the High Court apparently saw these challans inoriginal.	Facts
The High Court states In the challans, which are Exhibits P3 to P6, the head Supertax Miscellaneous Surcharge and Excess Profits Tax are scored and only the head Incometax is left intact, indicating thereby that the demands related only to incometax and not to excess profits tax.	Facts
2.	Facts
We have mentioned this matter here because it is one of the contentions of the learned counsel for the defendant that these payments were made towards taxes in general and not towards incometax only, while the plaintiffs contend that the demands related only to incometax and payments were also made towards incometax.	Facts
According to the plaintiffs, on August 11, 1953, for the first time the Incometax Officer wrote to A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi that excess profits tax was also payable under the voluntary disclosure statements for 1119, 1120 and 1121.	Facts
The Incometax Officer stated in this letter that total excess profits tax due was Rs. 1, 29, 72430, and after adjusting payments already made to the extent of Rs. 71, 85190, Rs. 57, 872100, was payable as balance excess profits tax.	Facts
A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi replied on August 19, 1953, requesting that they may be permitted to pay the said amount of Rs. 57, 8721 00 as tax for the incometax year 1119, in three equal monthly instalments.	None
However, on August 25, 1953, A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi took the position that no excess profits tax was due as the assessments in respect of excess profits tax for the years 1119, 1120 and 1121 became final by the orders of the Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax in Excess Profit Appeals Nos. 3 of 1120, 7 of 1121 and Excess Profits Tax Review No. 2 of 1124, respectively.	Facts
He alleged that the said orders have not been and could not be reopened under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act.	Facts
He, further asserted that the Incometax Officer had no jurisdiction to appropriate the sum of Rs. 71, 85190 which had been paid by him as advance tax towards incometax and supertax that may be legally due under the disclosure scheme towards the excess profits tax alleged to be dueFurther correspondence ensued between the parties.	None
However, on August 31, 1954, three demand notices for incometax were issued to A. P. Damodara Shenoi, A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi having died in the meantime.	None
P23 was for recovery of Rs. 8, 290130, P24 for Rs. 38, 02370, and P25 for Rs. 8, 886110.	None
The total came to Rs. 55, 200.	Facts
The plaintiffs filed three petitions under article 226 of the Constitution challenging these demand notices.	Facts
The High Court dismissed the petitions on February 27, 1955, stating We think it desirable, therefore, that the matter be considered in an original suit which the petitioners are free to file.	Facts
A. P. Damodara Shenoi, son of late A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi, and A. P. Narasinga Shenoi, brother of A. P. Damodara Shenoi, the plaintiffs, thereupon filed a suit in the Anjikaimal District Court, Ernakulam (Original Suit No. 31 of 1955), praying for a decree (A) declaring that the plaintiffs or the estate of late A. N. Padmanabha Shenoi are not defaulters in the payment of incometax, that the demand notices dated August 31, 1954, to the tune of Rs. 55, 200150, mentioned in paragraph 4 supra are void, their issue being beyond the competence of the defendants for the reasons stated above, and restraining the defendants by a permanent injunction from enforcing the said demand by any coercive process (B) declaring that no excess profits tax is leviable by the defendants or the incometax department from the plaintiffs or the estate of the late A. N., Padmanabha Shenoi during the relevant periods and that the amounts paid should stand credited towards incometax (C) ordering the first defendant to make good to the plaintiffs the sum of Rs. 16, 65000 with interest thereon by way of damages at 6 per cent.	Facts
from September 22, 1954, till date of realisationThe trial court held that Padmanabha Shenoi had not agreed to pay excess profits tax on the disclosed income as per the statements made by him on April 25, 1952, and July 31, 1953.	Facts
The trial court observed There is no record at all to show that either the plaintiffs or their father agreed to pay excess profits tax There is also no case of an, oral agreement to pay excess profits tax.	Facts
The trial court further held Admittedly, all the challans for payment of incometax were filled up and issued from the incometax office under the direction of D. W. 1.	Facts
All other items except incometax have been scored off and the amounts are paid into the Treasury towards the head Incometax It was for the first tame on 11th August, 1953, that the adjustment of Rs. 71, 85190 was made by the Incometax Officer	None
The letter is not an assessment order.	None
The Incometax Officer does not say under what authority he has adjusted the said amount towards excess profits tax There is nothing in exhibit D9 to show that either Padmanabha Shenoi or his son, the first plaintiff, agreed to pay the excess profits tax.	Facts
The trial court further held If payments are already made towards incometax, they could not be readjusted or reopened, the demand notices for payment of incometax cannot be considered to be valid, because no amount remains to be paid towards incometax.	None
3.	Facts
The trial court also held that excess profits tax was not leviable from the plaintiffs on the relevant dates.	None
The trial court further repelled the contention of the Union of India that the plaintiffs are estopped from denying their liability to pay excess profits tax.	None
In the result, the trial court passed a decree granting the prayers made by the plaintiffs.	None
4.	None
The defendant appealed to the High Court.	None
The High Court upheld all the findings of the trial court, but observed Having assessed excess profits tax, the department has allowed deduction in regard thereto in the assessment of incometax for the relevant years.	None
As the assessee is found not liable to excess profits tax and has not therefore to pay the same, we must necessarily quash the deduction made by the department and declare the assessee liable to pay incometax (inclusive of supertax) on the income disclosed by him.	None
Counsel for the revenue has submitted a statement showing the amount of tax payable by the plaintiffs as the legal representatives of the assessee if no deduction for excess profits tax is made, and has served a copy thereof on counsel for the plaintiffrespondents who has conceded the correctness thereof before us.	None
Under that statement a sum of Rs. 21, 884130 remains due from the plaintiffs to the department.	None
It must then follow that the decree of the court below has to be discharged, except in regard to the declaration of nonliability of the assessee for excess profits tax and the demand notices, exhibits P23, P24 and P25, dated August 31, 1954, issued by the department to the plaintiffs held valid for the aggregate sum of Rs. 21, 884.81 nP. judgment accordingly.	None
Accordingly, the High Court passed a decree in the following terms This court doth order and decree as follows  1.	None
that the decree of the court below be and hereby is discharged, except in regard to the declaration of nonliability of the plaintiffs (legal representatives of the assessee) for excess profits tax 2.	None
that the demand notices, exhibits P23, P24 and P25, dated August 31, 1954, issued by the appellant 1st defendant to the plaintiffs are held valid for the aggregate sum of Rs. 21, 884.81 nP. and 3.	None
that the appeal is allowed as indicated above.	None
5.	None
The learned counsel for the plaintiffs in Civil Appeal No. 100 of 1966, contends that the High Court erred in holding, (a) that the demand notices, P23, P24 and P25, were valid to the extent of Rs. 21, 884.81 nP. and (b) that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a refund of Rs. 16, 650, with interest from September 22, 1954.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel for the defendant in Civil Appeal No. 101 of 1966 contends that the High Court erred in holding, (a) that the father of the plaintiffs, A. N. Padmanabha shenoi had not agreed to pay excess profits tax (b) that, at any rate, he was estopped from saying that he had not agreed to pay excess profits tax and (c) that the suit was barred by the provisions of section 111 of the Cochin Incometax Act of 1117 M. E., which, inter alia, provides that no suit shall be brought in any civil court to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act.	Arguments of Respondent
We will first deal with the points raised in Civil Appeal No. 101 of 1966, by the learned counsel for the defendant, seriatimWhether the plaintiffs father had agreed to pay excess profits tax in addition to incometax is a question of fact.	None
Both the trial court and the High Court have found that there was no such agreement.	Reasoning
No writing is produced in support of this contention.	Reasoning
The notification of the Government of India, dated May 20, 1951, does not mention excess profits tax or Excess Profits Tax Officers.	Reasoning
We have not been shown any material to enable us to set aside this concurrent finding.	Reasoning
In the result, it must be held that, it is not proved that the plaintiffs father had agreed to pay excess profits tax.	Reasoning
6.	None
There is also no force in the plea of estoppel.	Reasoning
Apart from the fact that in the letter dated August 19, 1953, the plaintiffs father did not contest his liability to pay excess profits tax, no fact has been brought to our notice which could sustain the plea of estoppel.	Reasoning
It appears that the plaintiffs father in the letter dated August 25, 1953, definitely took the stand that no excess profits tax was due.	None
The learned counsel for the defendant also relied on the payment of Rs. 1, 04, 688130 under four challans dated March 23, 1952, February 25, 1953, March 27, 1953, and August 25, 1953.	Reasoning
But both the trial court and the High Court have found that in these challans the heads Supertax, miscellaneous, surcharge and excess profits tax were scored out.	Reasoning
In our opinion, there is no force in this point.	None
7.	None
The last point regarding jurisdiction is equally without any substance.	Reasoning
First, no such point was raised in the trial court or the High Court.	Reasoning
It appears that the defendant successfully pleaded in the writ petitions filed in the High Court that the proper remedy for the plaintiffs was a suit and not a writ petition under article 226.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, there is no force in this point.	None
Section 111 of the Cochin Incometax Act of 1117 M. E. bars a suit to set aside an assessment.	Reasoning
No prayer was made in the suit for setting aside any assessment.	Reasoning
What was claimed in the suit was that the plaintiffs father had not agreed to pay excess profits tax and the department had no jurisdiction to appropriate payments made towards incometax to excess profits tax, due not under any assessment orders made under the Excess Profits Tax Act but under executive orders or calculations made on the supposition that the plaintiffs father had agreed to pay tax.	Reasoning
Such a suit, in our opinion, lies wholly outside the scope of section 111.	Reasoning
We may here, deal with the question of refund of Rs. 16, 650 ordered by the trial court but denied by the High Court.	Reasoning
The learned counsel for the plaintiffs says that the plaintiffs have filed an application or applications for refund and as these applications have not been disposed of yet, he does not press for the passing of a decree for the refund of Rs. 16, 650.	Reasoning
In view of this statement we do not consider it necessary to deal with the point whether the High Court was right in reversing the trial court on this point.	Reasoning
In the result we hold that there is no merit in the appeal filed by the defendant.	None
Civil Appeal No. 101 of 1966 is accordingly dismissed with costsComing to the plaintiffs appeal, we are of the view that the High Court erred in holding that the demand notices P23, P24 and P25 were valid to the extent of Rs. 21, 884.81.	Reasoning
This sum was arrived at by revising the assessment orders, not under any provision of the Incometax Act, but by the counsel for the revenue.	None
The assessment orders stand as they were before.	None
We are unable to appreciate how the assessment orders can be revised except under the provisions of the Incometax Act.	None
Neither the counsel for the defendant nor the High Court has power to revise any assessment order.	None
Indeed, section 111 of the Cochin Incometax Act interdicts the High Court.	None
It is true the High Court has not done it directly, but indirectly it has done so.	None
Consequently, we set aside the finding of the High Court that the demand notices, P23, P24 and P25, were valid to the extent of Rs. 21, 884.81.	None
8.	None
In the result, Civil Appeal No. 100 of 1966 succeeds to the extent indicated above.	Decision
The plaintiffs will have their costs in this court.	Decision
9.	None
There will be one hearing fee in both the appeals.	None
10.	None
Civil Appeal No. 100 of 1966 allowed inpart.	Decision
11.	None
Civil Appeal No. 101 of 1966 dismissed.	Decision
