The High Court however hold that the appellants were not entitled to any relief on three grounds.	None
First, the administrative surcharges were paid voluntarily by the appellants.	Facts
The appellants themselves represented for issue of permits.	Facts
The appellants obtained the permits.	Facts
They exported rice under the permits.	Facts
The High Court, therefore, held that the appellants cannot claim refund of the entire amount without giving due credit for the expenses or charges incurred by the Government for the issue of permits and for the supervision of export, transport and other administrative charges.	Facts
The second reason given by the High Court was that the Court would not be justified in exercising discretion in favour of the appellants who voluntarily paid the administrative charges, obtained the permits and derived considerable profits there from.	Facts
The third reason given by the High Court was that there was undue delay in claiming the refund.10.	Facts
The appellants contended that the three grounds on which t he High Court dismissed the writ petitions were unsustainable.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is said on behalf of one of the appellants (Civil Appeals No. 2584 to 2586 of 1972) that in their application dated 10 February, 1970 for refund of charges paid by them the appellants gave particulars of payments showing the dates of payment, quantity covered by the permit, the amount of charges paid, the number of permit against which payment was made as well as the challenge under which the payment was made Thereafter the appellants called upon the Collector to furnish copies of regulations under which surcharge was collected.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Collector by letter dated 28 July 1970 informed the appellants that the State Government alone was competent to give t he copy of the relevant rule or regulation under which surcharge was collected.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants referred to the letters dated 22 December, 1970 and 2 January, 1971 by which the State Government refused to grant certified copy of the rule or regulation on the ground that it was part of the official correspondence not meant to be supplied to the private party.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this back ground the appellants contended that since 10 February, 1970 when the appellants demanded refund the appellants from time to time made application for refund and the last reminder was on 30 December, 1971.	Arguments of Petitioner
Some of the appellants filed their writ petitions in the High Court in the month of September, 1970 and some of them filed A, their writ petitions in the month of January 1972.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was, therefore, said that The applications for refund were all made within three years from the date of payment and the High Court should not have dismissed the writ petitions on the ground of delay.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants next contended that the pleadings were not vague and the appellants in Civil Appeals No. 2584 to 2586 of 1972 gave B. all details of the payments and, therefore, the High Court should not have dismissed the writ petitions on the ground of vagueness of particulars and pleadings.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also said on behalf of the appellants that if the levy as well as collection of administrative surcharges was without authority of law the High Court was in error in refusing any relief t o the appellants on the ground that the payments were voluntarily made.11.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants relied on the decision of this Court in The State of Kerala etc. v. k. P. Govindan	None
Tapioca Exporter etc.(1975 2 S.C.R. 635) as an authority for the proposition that the levy of administrative surcharge is illegal.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the Tapioca case (supra) under the Kerala Tapioca Manufacture and Export (Control) order, 1966 no person could export tapioca except in accordance with permit.	Arguments of Petitioner
The State Government Levied administrative surcharge under a scheme.	Arguments of Petitioner
The State contended that the administrative surcharge was in effect and substance a licence fee charged in exercise of the police powers of the State for permitting the appellants by grant of permits to export tapioca.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Court held that the scheme was not an order under any of the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act and no licence fee or fee for grant of permit was imposed by the Kerala Tapioca Control order.	Arguments of Petitioner
The E. Kerala Tapioca Control order only provided for levy of administrative surcharge.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Kerala Tapioca Control order came into existence on 9 June, 1966.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even before the promulgation of the order administrative surcharge was levied under a scheme formulated by the State Government on 15 April, 1966 published in the Kerala Gazette on 3 May, 1966.	Arguments of Petitioner
The rate of administrative surcharge levied on tapioca under the scheme dated 15 April, 1966 varied from time to time.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Court found that the order dated 15 April, 1966 formulating the scheme was not an order under any of the provisions of section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Scheme did not impose any licence fee.	Arguments of Petitioner
The scheme merely provided for levying of administrative surcharge.	Arguments of Petitioner
The orders levying administrative surcharge which followed the Tapioca Control order did not refer to the exercise of any power under the order.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, this Court held that G. the administrative surcharge in the Tapioca case (supra) was bad and the realisations were without any authority of law.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants contended relying on the decision of this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Bhailal Bhai (1964 6 S.C.R 261) that the High Court in exercise of powers under Article 226 has power to order refund and repayment of tax illegally collected.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants submitted H that the State had no power under any statute or any authority to impose and collect administrative surcharge and, therefore, the payments which were made by the appellants were made under mistake of law and the State was liable to refund them.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellants contended that the administrative surcharge was neither in the nature of a fee nor was it a tax and there was no authority of law to support the levy and collection of administrative surcharge.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was said on behalf of the appellants that neither the Essential commodities Act, 1955 nor the Southern States (Regulation of Export of Rice) order, 1964 nor the Andhra Pradesh Rice and Paddy order, 1965 nor the Andhra Pradesh Rice Procurement (Levy and Restriction on Sale) order, 1967 conferred any power to levy administrative surcharge.12.	None
The respondents contended that the permits were granted pursuant to the representation of the appellants that unless they were allowed the movement of rice to places outside their blocks or outside the State they could not sell rice locally because there was no demand.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents further said that for ensuring export of rice the administrative machinery had to be set up.	Arguments of Respondent
The permits were grant ed on terms and conditions of payment of surcharge and the appellants voluntarily paid surcharge and received benefits under permits.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents also said that the permits were contractual obligations between the appellants and the respondents.13.	None
The High Court in exercise of its discretion refused to grant mandamus on a consideration of facts and circumstances of the ca se.	None
The two principal matters which weighed with the High Court are these.	None
First, the appellants voluntarily paid the amounts and derived full advantage and benefit by utilizing the permits.	None
Second, there is undue delay in claiming refund.	None
Where the High Court has in exercise of discretion refused to grant a writ of mandamus, this Court does not ordinarily interfere.	None
(See Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay v. Advance Builders (India) Private Limited(1972 1 S.C.R. 408 at p. 420.)	None
D. Cawasji Co, v. State of Mysore.(1975	None
2 S.C.R. Sl I at p. 527)Refund of illegal taxes stands on a different footing from claiming refund of surcharge paid under terms and conditions of permits.	None
The only basis of tax is legislative sanction and if the legislative sanction fails, the collection of tax cannot be sustained.	None
In the present case the claim for refund is to be judged between the rival contentions.	None
The appellants contend that there is no legislative sanction for collection of administrative surcharge.	None
The respondents on the other hand support the collection of administrative surcharge first as a condition for permit and second as an item of maintenance charges in the maintenance and supervision of the scheme for export of rice.14.	None
The respondents also contend that the appellants have no right to claim refund under section 72 of the Indian Contract Act because the payments were neither under mistake of law nor under coercion.	None
It is said by the respondents that there is no coercion because the export scheme was voluntary.	Arguments of Respondent
Again, it is said that there is no mistake because the payments made were in fact due as part of the export scheme initiated at the instance of the appellants.	Arguments of Respondent
The respondents deny the claim of the appellants on the further ground that the appellants having derived the benefit and caused detriment to the A Government are estopped from questioning the validity of the payments voluntarily made.	Arguments of Respondent
Another ground on which the respondents challenge the claim of the appellants is that the payments were part of the consideration of the agreement entered into by the appellants with State.	None
If it be assumed that the agreements are illegal, the respondent contends that the appellant being a party to the same cannot sue for recovery of money paid.15.	None
All the matters were covered by the common judgment.	None
In some cases the claims were beyond three years from the date of the payments.	None
In some cases they were within a lesser time but the ground of delay on which the High Court exercised discretion is not confined L purely to period of limitation but is bound up with matters relating to conduct of parties in regard to payments pursuant to agreements between the parties.	None
The remedy under Article 226 is not appropriate in the present cases for these reasons as well.	None
First, several petitioners have joined.	None
Each petitioner has individual and independent cause of action.	None
A suit by such a combination of plaintiffs would be open to misjoinder.	None
Second, there are triable issues like limitation, estoppel and questions of fact in ascertaining the expenses incurred by the Government for administrative surcharges of the scheme and allocating the expenses with regard to quality as well as quantity of rice covered by the permits.16.	None
The appellants contended that in all cases of claim for refund of money, the payments were voluntary and, therefore, the High 3 Court was in error in refusing refund because of the voluntary character of payment.	None
In cases relating to refund of payments of tax which is illegal the voluntary character of payment is that tax payer has no say but is compelled to pay.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the present cases the questions are whether it can be said that payments of administrative charges were voluntary in order to reap benefits of export of rice covered by the permits.	Arguments of Petitioner
The contention of the respondents that the export scheme was framed at the instance of the appellants and that the administrative surcharge is the consideration for preparation, maintenance and supervision of the scheme raises questions which can be solved by a suit.	Arguments of Petitioner
A mandamus will go where there is a specific legal right.	None
Mandamus may be refused where there is an alternative remedy which is equally convenient, beneficial and effectual.	None
If there is no other means of obtaining justice, the writ of mandamus is grant ed to enable justice to be done.	None
Those are cases where justice can not be done unless a mandamus is to go.	None

this Court said that normally the parties are relegated to a suit to enforce civil liability arising out of a breach of contract or a tort to pay an amount of money.	None
An order for payment of money may sometimes be made to enforce a statutory obligation.	None
In the State of Kerala v. Aluminium Industries Ltd.(16 S.T.C. 689.)	None
the refund claimed was by reason of the moneys being paid under mistake of law and the collection having been made wrongly.	None
The petitions solely for the writ of mandamus directing the State to refund the moneys in the present case have been rightly refused by the High Court on the grounds of delay, insufficiency of particulars and pleadings, and voluntary payments.	None
The additional reasons in our opinion are that various questions of fact arise as to whether there was really mistake or it was a case of voluntary payment pursuant to contractual rights and obligations.17.	None
The plea of mistake is a bare averment in the writ petitions.	Reasoning
The payments did not disclose t he circumstances under which the alleged mistake occurred and the circumstances in which the legal position became known to the appellants.	Reasoning
The respondents contradicted the plea of mistake.	Reasoning
A triable issue arose as to whether there w as a mistake in paying the amounts and when exactly the mistake occurred and under what circumstances.	Reasoning
Section 72 of the Contract Act states that a person to whom money has been paid, or anything delivered, by mistake or under coercion, must rep ay or return it.	Reasoning
The mistake is material only so far as it leads to the payment being made without consideration.	Reasoning
This Court has said that the true principle is that if one party under a mistake of law pays to another money which is not due by contract or otherwise that is to be repaid.	Reasoning
When there is a clear and unambiguous position of law which entitles a party to the relief claimed by him equitable considerations are not imported.	Reasoning
A contract entered into under a mistake of law of both parties falls under section 21 of the Contract Act and not section 72.	Reasoning
If a mistake of law had led to the formation of a contract, section 21 enacts that the contract is not for that reason voidable.	Reasoning
If money is paid under that contract, it cannot be said that the money was paid under mistake of law it was paid because it was due under a valid contract and if it had not been paid payment could have been enforced.	Reasoning
(See Shiba Prasad Singh v. Srish Chandra Nandi(76 I.A. 244.)	Reasoning
See also Pollock MullaContract Act 9th Ed.	Reasoning
by J. L. Kapur pp. 519520).	Reasoning
In the present case, the respondents do not support the demand for administrative charges either as a tax or as a fee but as a term and condition of permit and as a term of agreement between the parties for the maintenance and supervision expenses for the scheme for export permits of rice from one block to another within the State or outside the State.18.	Reasoning
It may be stated here that in cases where the State collected administrative changes but could not grant permits the State refunded moneys to such Person.	None
It is only where millers have obtained permits and taken advantage thereof that the State contends that there is no mistake and that the payments were made voluntarily with full knowledge of facts.	None
For these reasons the appeals are dismissed.	Decision
If the parties are so advised they may institute suits and all rival contentions would be open to both parties.	Decision
Parties will pay and bear their own costs.19.	Decision
Appeals dismissed.	None
