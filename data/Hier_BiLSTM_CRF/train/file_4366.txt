As to the fourth impeached resolution which is now the bone of contention between the parties in this appeal, the following facts are found by the High Court.	Facts
The Government of Madras under the Madras Planning Act by an order dated 24 May, 1945 approved the Central Ward Town Planning Scheme in Udipi.	Facts
Clause 15 of the Scheme provided that shops and business premises might be permitted only in places shown as reserved for the purpose.	Facts
Business premises under the scheme means a building designed for use as an office or theatre or for any business purpose but does not include a petrol filling station, special industrial building, factory or workshop.	Facts
The respondents contended in the High Court that the scheme was intended to be in force only for a period of 20 years and that it either lapsed or ceased to be in force after expiration of 20 years.	Facts
The High Court rejected the contention that the scheme lapsed after 20 years from 20 May, 1945.	Facts
The High Court further accepted the contention of the appellant that under clause 15 of the Scheme a cinema theatre which is regarded in the Scheme as business premises cannot be constructed in a place other than Badagapet Road, Hanuman Office Road and Post Office Road without the sanction of the responsible Authority and without the previous approval of the Director of Town Planning.19.	Facts
The High Court said that between the grant of permission to convert the building into a cinema theatre and the issue of interim order in Writ Petition No. 4904 of 1972 there was an interval of more than five months.	Facts
The High Court took into consideration the allegations of the third respondent that he spent nearly the sum of Rs. 5 lakhs.	Facts
Taking into account the circumstances of the case the High Court did not quash the fourth resolution dated 19 June, 1970, permitting the third respondent to convert the building into a cinema theatre.	Facts
The High Court however made it clear that nothing said by the High Court in that order should come in the way of the Licensing Authority under the Cinemas Act in considering the merits of the application of the third respondent for a licence and the objections thereto by the appellant.20.	Facts
Apart from clause 15 of the Town Planning Scheme which has already been noticed, reference may be made to clause 14 of the Scheme.	None
Clause 14 provides that every part of the area shall be utilised for residential purposes only, provided Hotels, Clubs and buildings for public worship or instruction or places of social intercourse, or recreation or hospitals or dispensaries or for any other purposes may be permitted by the responsible authority with the previous approval of the Director.21.	None
Counsel for the appellant rightly put in the forfront that there was no appeal preferred by the third respondent against the order of the Municipality dated 20 April, 1970 when the Municipality refused permission for construction of a cinema theatre building on the premises forming the subject of appeal.	Reasoning
The appeal was only against the order dated 18 April, 1970 whereby licence for exhibiting cinematographic films was refused under the Madras Places of Public Resorts Act, 1888 read with Rule B of the Town Planning Scheme.	Reasoning
Pursuant to this appeal the Municipality on 11 June, 1970 granted licence to exhibit films.	Reasoning
The High Court rightly quashed that order for the reasons indicated in the judgment.22.	None
Counsel for the appellant rightly submitted that the Town Planning Scheme forbade any cinema building at the place where the third respondent has asked for the cinema building and therefore the resolution is invalid.	Arguments of Petitioner
The area where this cinema building is situate is a residential one and therefore in the absence of the scheme sanctioning such a cinema building in that area, the authority of the Municipal Council to sanction it is rightly challenged.23.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel for the respondents contended that the appellant had pursued alternative remedies.	Arguments of Respondent
One was the suit filed in 1970 for injunction against the third respondent to restrain installation of cinematographic apparatus and using the building as a cinema house.	Arguments of Respondent
The other is Writ Petition No. 755 of 1973 challenging the order of the Deputy Commissioner dated 14 March, 1973 permitting exhibition of films.	Arguments of Respondent
The suit does not seek any relief in respect of the impeached resolution which forms the subjectmatter of this appeal.	None
The writ petition also does not relate to any relief in that behalf.	Reasoning
The contention of the respondents fails.24.	None
Another contention on behalf of the respondent is that if there is any beach of a statutory duty, the appellant will not be entitled to any relief without an injury.	Arguments of Respondent
The breach of a statutory duty created for the benefit of an individual or a class is a tortious act.	Reasoning
Anyone who suffers special damage therefrom is entitled to recover damages, Counsel for the third respondent relied on Cutler v. Wandsworth Stadium, 1949 AC 398.	Reasoning
In that case a bookmaker alleged that he suffered damage in that the occupier had failed to make available for bookmakers space on the track where they could conveniently carry on bookmaking in connection with dog races run on the track under the Betting and Lotteries Act, 1934.	Reasoning
It was held that the object of the Act was to provide the public and not the bookmakers with its requirements for the purposes of betting.	Reasoning
It was no object of the Act to confer on individual bookmakers a privilege in furtherance of their business which they never possessed before.	Reasoning
Consequently no action was maintainable.	Reasoning
The question whether an individual who is one of a class for whose benefit such an obligation is imposed can or cannot enforce performance by an action must depend on the purview of the legislature in the particular statute.	Reasoning
Injury may be caused either by the fulfilment of the duty cast by the statute or by failure to carry it out or by negligence in its performance.25.	Reasoning
In order to succeed in an action for damages for breach of statutory duty the plaintiff must establish a breach of a statutory obligation which, on the proper construction of the statute was intended to be a ground of civil liability to a class of persons of whom he is one.	Reasoning
He must establish an injury or damage of a kind against which the statute was designed to give protection.	Reasoning
The present case is not for pecuniary damages for breach of statutory duties.26.	Reasoning
In the present case the appellant contends that the Municipality has illegally sanctioned the plan for, conversion into a cinema.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant as the resident in the area has the right to compel the Municipality to perform duty imposed by the statute.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant has a right to insist on such performance of duty because he has an individual interest in the performance of the duty imposed by the Act that the scheme is not violated.	Arguments of Petitioner
The appellant resides in the area where the plan for conversion of the Kalyana MantapcumLecture Hall into a cinema has been granted.	Arguments of Petitioner
This is a residential area.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Municipality cannot act in disregard of scheme.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Municipality is not the authority to vary or modify the Scheme.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Municipality on 29 April, 1970 refused to sanction a plan for construction of cinema theatre building.	Arguments of Petitioner
The construction of the building had been earlier permitted as a Kalyana MantapcumLecture Hall and not for cinema theatre.	Arguments of Petitioner
That was the reason given by the Municipality for refusal to sanction a plan for construction of the cinema theatre building.	Arguments of Petitioner
The resolution of 11 June, 1970 on appeal against the order dated 18 April, 1970 granting licence for cinema under the Madras Places of Public Resorts Act has been quashed by the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, there is no licence to exhibit films.	Arguments of Petitioner
the other resolutions quashed, by the High Court indicate that the installation of the electric motor and oil engine is not sanctioned.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Municipality has no power to convert the lecture hall into a cinema theatre.	Arguments of Petitioner
No provision in the statute has been shown to support such an exercise of power.27.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel for the respondents contended that a mere grant of licence to construct a cinema causes no injury and the appellant would have no cause of action until the building would be actually used as a cinema.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant can challenge at the threshold when the Scheme which is framed for the benefit of the residents in that area is violated by the Municipality.	Arguments of Respondent
The Municipality acts for the public benefit in enforcing the Scheme.	Arguments of Respondent
Where the Municipality acts in excess of the powers conferred by the Act or abuses those powers then in those cases it is not exercising its jurisdiction irregularly or wrongly	Arguments of Respondent
but it is usurping powers which it does not posses.	Arguments of Respondent
The right to build on his own land is a right incidental to the ownership of that land.	Arguments of Respondent
Within the Municipality the exercise of that right has been regulated in the interest of the community residing within the limits of the Municipal Committee.	Arguments of Respondent
If under presence of any authority which the law does give to the Municipality it goes beyond the line of its authority, and infringes or violates the rights of others, it becomes like all other individuals amenable to the jurisdiction of the Courts.	Arguments of Respondent
If sanction is given to build by contravening a byelaw the jurisdiction of the Courts will be invoked on the ground that the approval by an authority of building plans which contravene the byelaws made by that authority is illegal and inoperative (see Yabbicom v. King, (1899) 1 QB 444).28.	Arguments of Respondent
An illegal construction of a cinema building materially affects the right to or enjoyment of the property by persons residing in the residential area.	Reasoning
The Municipal Authorities owe a duty and obligation under the statute to see that the residential area is not spoilt by unauthorised construction.	Reasoning
The scheme is for the benefit of the residents of the locality.	Reasoning
The Municipality acts in aid of the scheme.	Reasoning
The rights of the residents in the area are invaded by an illegal construction of a cinema building.	Reasoning
It has to be remembered that a scheme in a residential area means planned orderliness in accordance with the requirements of the residents.	Reasoning
If the scheme is nullified by arbitrary acts in excess and derogation the powers of the Municipality the courts will quash orders passed by Municipalities in such cases.29.	Reasoning
The Court enforces the performance of statutory duty by public bodies as obligation to rate payers who have a legal right to demand compliance by a local authority with its duty to observe statutory rights alone.	Reasoning
The scheme here is for the benefit of the public.	Reasoning
There is special interest in the performance of the duty.	Reasoning
All the residents in the area have their personal interest in the performance of the duty.	Reasoning
The special and substantial interest of the residents in the area is injured by the illegal construction.30.	Reasoning
The High Court was not correct in holding that though the impeached resolution sanctioning plan for conversion of building into a cinema was in violation of the Town Planning Scheme yet it could not be disturbed because the third respondent is likely to have spent money.	Reasoning
An excess of statutory power cannot be validated by acquiescence in or by the operation of an estoppel.	Reasoning
The Court declines to interfere for the assistance of persons who seek it aid to relieve them against express statutory provision.	Reasoning
Lord Selborne in Maddison v. Alderson, (1883) 8 App Cas 467 said that courts of equity would not permit the statute to be made an instrument of fraud.	Reasoning
The impeached resolution of the Municipality has no legal foundation.	Reasoning
The High Court was wrong in not quashing the resolution on the surmise that money might have been spent.	Reasoning
Illegality is incurable.31.	Reasoning
For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is accepted.	Decision
The order of the High Court leaving resolution dated 19 June, 1970 being Annexure D to the Petition undisturbed is set aside.	Decision
The resolution dated 19 June, 1970 being Annexure D to the Petition before the High Court is quashed.	Decision
The parties will pay and bear their own costs.32.	Decision
Appeal allowed.	Decision
