11.	Arguments of Petitioner
The primary stand of the appellant is that the EGOM GOI should have accepted the recommendations of the EC and should not have asked the GETE to make further examination.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that GETE did not examine the queries relating to GMR as raised by the IMG and the reduction of technical qualification from 80 to 50 was impermissible.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also submitted that the appointment of GETE itself was illegal and unauthorized.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court proceeded on the basis as if EGOM had absolute discretion in the matter of choosing the modalities.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is also submitted that the uniform pattern of assessment has not been done and while reducing the marks so far as the appellant is concerned, similar procedure has not been adopted so far as GMR and GVK are concerned.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the initial assessment, only the GMR and the appellant had crossed the bench mark.	Arguments of Petitioner
If in respect of one airport GMR was given the option of matching the financial bid of the appellant, in respect of the other airport similar option should have been given to the appellant who was at the relevant point of time and even now willing to match the financial bid of GVK.	Arguments of Petitioner
There was no justification for reduction of standard from 80 to 50, particularly when at all stages EGOM had emphasized that there shall not be any compromise with quality.	Arguments of Petitioner
The argument that any bidder who had crossed the mandatory requirement stage would be competent to execute the contract is completely erroneous since in that case there was no need to fix the high bench mark of 80.	Arguments of Petitioner
Appellant had scored over 80 on the development side and fell short of merely 6 less than 80 on the management side.	Arguments of Petitioner
The award of contract to the third ranked bidder i.e. GVK who had scored only 59 on the development side and whose bid had been adversely commented upon by all committees is against public interest.	Arguments of Petitioner
The bench mark of 80 had been approved by the EGOM.	Arguments of Petitioner
The EC expressly recommended against lowering the bench mark and the EGOM in its meeting on 5.12.2005 had also wanted the bench mark to remain at 80.	Arguments of Petitioner
GETE had also not recommended lowering of the bench mark.	Arguments of Petitioner
12.	Arguments of Petitioner
The constitution of GETE was without jurisdiction as it was outside the RFP.	Arguments of Petitioner
Allegations made by the respondents in the arguments that EC was biased are not factually correct.	Arguments of Petitioner
As noted above, GETE was not competent to deal with the issues relating to airports and, therefore, it was not a competent body to express any view.	Arguments of Petitioner
GETEs evaluation of appellants bid was wrong and it should not have interfered with ECs evaluation.	Arguments of Petitioner
Different weight ages were justified in case for criteria 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 and also in respect of criteria 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.	Arguments of Petitioner
GETEs view as regards non aeronautical revenue being less than 40 is not correct.	Arguments of Petitioner
Its view about the lack of experience of operating in a nonOECD country is also erroneous.	Arguments of Petitioner
The marking system for absorption of AAI employees as done in the case of the appellant has been wrongly interfered with.	Arguments of Petitioner
13.	Arguments of Petitioner
Appellant has contended that EC has given marks on the basis of RFP parameters.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to it, the parameters were fixed by the GOI or the EC.	Arguments of Petitioner
The question is not of allotting marks, the real issue is whether right parameters have been applied.	Arguments of Petitioner
It has been emphasized that the other Committees consisted of mainly bureaucrats or persons with inadequate technical knowledge, only the EC was an expert body and, therefore, its view had to be given primacy.	Arguments of Petitioner
14.	Arguments of Petitioner
GMR had qualified in both the bids.	Arguments of Petitioner
Appellant has contended that the option of choosing one of the airports should not have been given to GMR but it should have been allotted the Mumbai airport because of its superior quality of bid in respect of the said airport.	Arguments of Petitioner
By giving option to choose one of the airports, the fate of the appellant was sealed because in the other, it had fallen below the bench mark.	Arguments of Petitioner
Though in one case, appellants bid was above the bench mark and its bid was the best amongst those who were below the bench mark in respect of the other airport, it has not been able to get any of the airports.	Arguments of Petitioner
15.	Arguments of Petitioner
Despite the specific mandate GETE had not examined the queries qua the other bidders.	Arguments of Petitioner
Objective criteria assessment which was the foundation for GETEs decision has no basis.	Arguments of Petitioner
In fact GETE itself had indicated that the assessment was subjective in totality.	Arguments of Petitioner
By making an artificial distinction between the subjective and objective queries, the real essence has been lost and unacceptable yardsticks have been applied.	Arguments of Petitioner
Queries made by members of the Review Committee, comments of the EC, comments of the Planning Commissions representatives and the various queries raised by IMG have been either lightly brushed aside or not considered by the GETE.	Arguments of Petitioner
The decision for lowering of technical standard was arbitrary.	Arguments of Petitioner
EGOM should have examined the conflicting reports given by the experts.	Arguments of Petitioner
Since no reason has been given by EGOM to adopt the report of the GETE by giving its preference over the report of EC, same cannot be maintained.	Arguments of Petitioner
Report of GETE was not independently examined.	Arguments of Petitioner
By reducing the bench mark, the zone of consideration was enlarged and it was against public interest.	Arguments of Petitioner
Since different yardsticks have been adopted and a partisan approach has been adopted, the decision is clearly unsustainable and is amenable to judicial review.	Arguments of Petitioner
Selective examination by GETE is not bona fide though no personal allegation of mala fide is made against the members of GETE.	Arguments of Petitioner
Adoption of technical criteria for one airport and financial criteria for the other is not in accordance with law.	Arguments of Petitioner
16.	None
In response, learned Counsel for the GMR, GVK, Union of India and the AAI have submitted that the appellant is trying to enlarge the scope of judicial review.	Arguments of Respondent
It is not a case of non existence of power.	Arguments of Respondent
It essentially relates to exercise of power.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant is trying to contend that the report of EC was sacrosanct and GETEs report was not to be accepted.	Arguments of Respondent
GETE has formed its view as to how the allotment of marks made by EC was clearly not in line with the prescription made in the RFP.	Arguments of Respondent
Marks have been allotted by EC on irrational basis and even marks had been awarded when no marks were to be awarded.	Arguments of Respondent
Even the EC while commenting upon the weaknesses of the airport development plan of GMR itself had said that the weaknesses would be sorted out at the stage when the master plan is drawn up.	Arguments of Respondent
It is pointed out that EC on whose evaluation appellant has led great stress found only one flaw with the plan given by GVK i.e. lack of reuse of existing facilities and the high cost limits to assess it as medium.	Arguments of Respondent
This is really a non factor, according to learned Counsel for GVK, because plan envisages fresh creation of assets at Mumbai airport whose existing buildings are outdated.	Arguments of Respondent
It is characterized as a lack of reuse as well as involving high costs.	Arguments of Respondent
It is pointed out that GVKs development plan took note of much larger amount of fresh development of assets considering that the existing buildings are outdated.	Arguments of Respondent
It has also considered that large sum of money for rehabilitation of the slum dwellers is required as they would have to be rehoused if a realistic plan for expansion of facilities and runways was to be drawn up.	Arguments of Respondent
The development in each of the phases of the 20 years of projected development was also a relevant factor.	Arguments of Respondent
There was departure by EC from the norms in various cases without good reasons.	Arguments of Respondent
Where there is such departure it shows arbitrariness.	Arguments of Respondent
This is a case which relates to judicial review of the exercise of power and not the existence of power.	Arguments of Respondent
It is pointed out that the basic fallacy in the argument of the appellant is its stress on EC being the only advisor to assist the EGOM in arriving at a decision.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that as rightly observed by the High Court, it was a part of multi tier decision making process and appointment of GETE is a part of the process.	Arguments of Respondent
It is pointed out that though the appellant has challenged the constitution of GETE, it, in uncertain terms, asked the GETE to assess the materials placed before it by the appellant.	Arguments of Respondent
The EGOM has given reasons for the appointment of GETE.	Arguments of Respondent
The EC was not designated in the RFP as an external expert agency on whose evaluation the Government was obliged to act.	Arguments of Respondent
In fact at the first stage itself GRC was constituted to review the evaluation done by EC.	Arguments of Respondent
The report of EC had no binding effect on the IMG much less the EGOM.	Arguments of Respondent
The AAI required permission from the Cabinet for privatization of airports.	Arguments of Respondent
The ultimate decision making authority was EGOM.	Arguments of Respondent
However, since the decision making process involved inputs from series of in house committees, this creation of GETE is in fact a part of in house mechanism.	Arguments of Respondent
This itself is clear from the fact that several Committees were constituted like EC, GRC, IMG and COS.	Arguments of Respondent
In view of the existence of various tiers in the decision making process, EGOM who has delegated the power of Cabinet did not exceed the powers by setting up the committees.	Arguments of Respondent
If the appellants submission is accepted, even the GRC, IMG and COS being not the committees mentioned specifically in the RFP, their constitution would be vulnerable.	Arguments of Respondent
This is certainly not a case of the appellant and these were not external agencies.	Arguments of Respondent
These committees form part of the inhouse mechanism for evaluation of the bids.	Arguments of Respondent
Their reports were to be used as inputs in the final decision making process and thus imparted a great deal of transparency.	Arguments of Respondent
Judicial review cannot involve evaluation of the comparative merits.	Arguments of Respondent
It has also been emphasized that the various discussions in the Committees established beyond doubt that the Union of India wanted a transparent process to be adopted considering the fact that this was a first case of private JV.	Arguments of Respondent
It enabled the EGOM to take note of various view points and take the final decision.	Arguments of Respondent
These discussions strengthened the decision making process and did not weaken it as contended by the appellant.	Arguments of Respondent
It has also been submitted that the conduct of the appellant is itself contrary to the norms fixed by the RFP.	Arguments of Respondent
Though it was specifically indicated that there shall not be any contract with the authorities connected with the decision making process, several times appellant wrote letters relating to matters which were under consideration.	Arguments of Respondent
It baffles one as to how the appellant had knowledge as to what had transpired in the meetings.	Arguments of Respondent
It was conveniently mentioned that the source of appellants knowledge was newspapers reports.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellant therefore has clearly violated the norms fixed by RFP and on that score alone, its bid should have been kept out of consideration.	Arguments of Respondent
A person who seeks relief on equitable ground should have clean conduct and surreptitious methods adopted by it cannot be condoned and this, according to learned Counsel for the respondents, is an additional factor to dismiss the appeal filed by the appellant.	Arguments of Respondent
It appears that whatever has been discussed in the various meetings apparently found its way outside.	Arguments of Respondent
Who was responsible for the leak is not very clear but it is not a very healthy trend.	Arguments of Respondent
The meetings were highly confidential and sensitive in nature dealing with global tenders.	Arguments of Respondent

Pivotal challenge by the appellant is to the constitution of GETE and the scope for its constitution.	Issue
It is to be noted that the ultimate authority to take the decision in the matter was EGOM.	Reasoning
It was within the powers of EGOM to decide as to what inputs it can take note of and the source of these inputs.	Reasoning
Therefore, the necessity for taking views of various committees constituted appears to be a stepin the right direction.	Reasoning
This was a step which appears to have been taken for making the whole decision making process transparent.	Reasoning
There was no question of having the view of one Committee in preference to another.	Reasoning
EC was a Committee constituted as a part of the decision making process like other Committees vis. GRC, COS and IMG.	Reasoning
In the multi tier system in the decision making process the authority empowered to take a decision can accept the view expressed by one committee in preference to another for plausible reasons.	Reasoning
It is not bound to accept the view of any committee.	Reasoning
These committees, it needs no emphasis, are constituted to assist the decision making authority in arriving at the proper decision.	Reasoning
It is a matter of discretion of the authority to modify the norms.	Reasoning
It is not a case of absolute discretion.	None
While exercising the discretion, certain parameters are to be followed.	None
Discretion said Lord Mansfield in R. V Wilkes (1770 (4) Bur 2527 when applied to a court of justice, means sound discretion guided by law.	None
It must be governed by rule, not by humour it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful but legal and regular.	None

Though the word, discretion literally means and denotes an uncontrolled power of disposal yet in law, the meaning given to this word appears to be a power decides within the limits allowed by positive rules of law as to the punishments, remedies or costs.	None
This would mean that even if a person has a discretion to do something the said discretion has to be exercised within the limit allowed by positive rules of law.	None
The literal meaning of the word discretion therefore, unmistakably avoids untrammeled or uncontrolled choice and more positively pointed out at there being a positive control of some judicial principles.	None
Discretion, in general, is the discernment of what is right and proper.	None
It denotes knowledge and prudence, that discernment which enables a person to judge critically of what is correct and proper united with caution nice discernment, and judgment directed by circumspection deliberate judgment soundness of judgment a science or understanding to discern between falsity and truth, between wrong and right, between shadow and substance, between equity and colourable glosses and pretences, and not to do according to the will and private affections of persons.

When it is said that something is to be done within the discretion of the authorities, that some tiling is to be done according to the rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion according to law and not humour.	None

And it must be exercised within the limit, to which an honest man, competent to the discharge of his office ought to confine himself (Per Lord HALSBURY, L C. in Sharp v. Wakefield (1891)	None

The word discretion connotes necessarily an act of a judicial character, and, as used with reference to discretion exercised judicially, it implies the absence of a hardandfast rule, and it requires an actual exercise of judgment and a consideration of the facts and circumstances which are necessary to make a sound, fair and just determination, and a knowledge of the facts upon which the discretion may properly operate.

When any thing is left to any person, Judge or magistrate to be done according to his discretion, the law intends it must be done with sound discretion, and according to law, (Tomlin).	None
In its ordinary meaning, the word signifies unrestrained exercise of choice or will freedom to act according to ones own judgment unrestrained exercise of will the liberty of power of acting without other control than ones own judgment.	None
But, when applied to public functionaries, it means a power or right conferred upon them by law, of acting officially in certain circumstances according to the dictates 01 their own judgment and conscience, uncontrolled by the judgment or conscience of others.	None

Discretion, Judicial is a certain latitude or liberty accorded by statute or rules to a judge as distinguished from a ministerial or administrative official, in adjudicating on matters brought before him, The use of the word judicial limits and regulates the exercise of the discretion, and prevents it from being wholly absolute, capricious, or exempt from review.	None
But the presence of the word discretion permits the judge to consider as a judge, what are vaguely termed, all the circumstances of the case and the purpose for which he is invested with the considerations of convenience or utility or saving of expense rather than on considerations of strict law or technicalities.	None
Such discretion is usually given on matters of procedure or punishment, or costs of administration rather than with reference to vested substantive rights.	None
The matters which should regulate the exercise of discretion have been stated by eminent judges in somewhat different forms of words but with substantial identity.	None
When a statute gives a judge a discretion, what is meant is a judicial discretion, regulated according to the known rules of law, and not the mere whim or caprice of the person to whom it is given on the assumption that he is discreet (Lee v. Bude Railway Co. (1871)	None
LR 6 CP 576 WILLES, J. and see Morgan v. Morgan 1869 LR 1 P M 644.	None
That discretion, like other judicial discretions, must be exercised according to common sense and according to justice, and if there is a miscarriage in the exercise of it, it will be reviewed but still it is a discretion, and for my own part I think that when a tribunal is invested by Act of Parliament, or by rules, with a discretion, without any indication in the Act or rules of the grounds on which the discretion is to be exercised, it is a mistake to lay down any rules with a view of indicating the particular grooves on which the discretion would run, for if the Act or rules did not fetter the discretion of the judge, why should the Court do so?

In the instant case, though the High Court seems to have noted that the EGOM has absolute discretion, it has really not held that the discretion was unfettered.	Reasoning
In fact it has on facts found that the discretion was properly exercised to make some variations in the terms of RFP.	Reasoning
Coming to the constitution of GETE, no mala fides are alleged against the members.	Reasoning
It is only the method of evaluation done by GETE which is challenged apart from contending that GETE should not have been constituted.	Reasoning
About the constitution of GETE, as noted above, the stand is clearly untenable.	Reasoning
So far as evaluation of the marks as done by EC is concerned, GETE has given reasons for altering the marks allotted which ultimately led to the non qualification of the appellant.	Reasoning
There were four identified areas where it was noted that the ECs approach in the evaluation exercise was inconsistent with the terms of the RFP.	Reasoning
EGOM in its order dated 27.12.2005 constituting GETE, stipulated as follows The Group would particularly look into and present its recommendations before the COS on Overall validation of the evaluation process, including calibration of the qualification and sensitivity analysis.	None
The sensitivity analysis will cover the impact of interse weight ages of subcriteria as well as scoring.	Reasoning
The issues raised by the Members of the Inter Ministerial Group about the evaluation process.	Reasoning
An overall assessment of transparency and fairness of the evaluation process, including steps required, if any, to achieve a transparent and fair outcome.	Reasoning
Suggestions for improving the selection process for Joint Venture Partner in the future.	Reasoning
Essentially there were four instances of rewriting of priorities and weight ages as contained in the RFP and valuation was then made by the EC on the basis of these re written priorities and weight ages.	Reasoning
These were as follows Change in priority in the matter of absorption of staff, Changing the weightage ascribed to property development by merging the marks for infrastructure development and property development, Changing of the weightage ascribed to non aeronautical development by failing to consider aeronautical revenue of 40 as a threshold less than which would not get any marks, and Changing the weightage of experience in respect of a nonOECD airport by treatment of a OECD airport on par with nonOECD airports.	Reasoning
As regards (i), the EC divided the marks between 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 unequally, and also awarded marks for the extent of absorption proposed from a baseline of Zero instead of a baseline of 40 which was the mandatory absorption criteria.	Reasoning
The RFP accorded a priority to a higher absorption of existing staff by the new company.	Reasoning
The EC proceeded to modify this priority.	Reasoning
It opined that the overall approach was more important than absorption, and gave marks accordingly.	Reasoning
So far as (ii) is concerned, the EC again altered the weight ages accorded in the RFP, which considered experience in property development as valuable as infrastructure development and thereby put each of them as a subhead.	Reasoning
According to EC, the former was not as important as the latter and thus gave 1.6 marks for the former (1.2.2) and 4.7 marks for the latter (1.2.3.).	Reasoning
As consequence of (iii) above, EC gave marks to the appellant who had projected less than 40 nonaeronautical revenue whereas the RFP clearly gave a weightage to aeronautical revenue beyond 40.	Reasoning
As rightly contended by the respondents, if a project has a high revenue share given to the government, then aeronautical revenue being regulated, the incomes would flow from nonaeronautical revenues.	Reasoning
However generation of such nonaeronautical revenues would involve a larger capital investment in property development.	Reasoning
EC (a) gave less marks to GVK because it had a high capital outlay projected (as compared to the appellant), (b) did not regard experience in property development as having the same priority as infrastructure development, and (c) gave marks to the appellant for its nonaeronautical revenue, although its projected revenue was less than 40.	None
As a consequence of (iv) above, EC gave marks to the appellant for Mexico Airport which is admittedly an OECD Airport  on the spacious reasoning that it is virtually like a nonOECD Airport since Mexico is like a developing country.	None
Relevant portions of GETEs reports read as follows FIRST REPORT DATED 7.1.2006 x x x 2.1.	None
The Group of Eminent Technical Experts (GETE) had their first meeting and deliberations on Friday, 30th December, 2005.	None
The presentation was basically for explaining the contents of the Request for Proposal (RFP), the approach adopted by the EC in evaluating the technical bids and the views expressed by Inter Ministerial Group (IMG) on the EC evaluation.	None
The EC explained that the weightage marks for the two criteria and subcriteria were already indicated in the RFP for the information of bidders.	None
Splitting up these marks to the different subfactors of subcriteria was done by the E.C. based on the mandate given to them by the I.M.G. On query from the GETE, they formed that after the technical bids were opened certain clarifications were invited from bidders mainly to sort out discrepancies in their submittals and not for eliciting additional Information or submission of additional documents.	None
E.C. stated that the assignment of marks for technical evaluation was done strictly based on the submittals of the tenderers.	None
2.2	None
The GETE again met on 2 January when only Shri Sanjay Narayan and Dr. Sihag were present.	None
The Consultants were not invited to this meeting.	None
In this meeting Shri Sanjay Narayan handed over to the GETE a copy of the Note prepared for the Committee of Secretaries (COS) dated 23rd December, 2005 together with all Annexures which also contained details of marks assigned (both original and revised) to the Consortiums A to E in The Annexure IX and Appendix II to Annexure XII to the Note.	None
In this meeting, the GETE enquired at what stage the apportionment of marks to the subfactors was done by the EC and whether after assigning these marks, the same had the approval of the I.M.G. The GETE also wanted to know whether after assigning the marks to the subfactors, the same were kept in a sealed cover to obviate the possibility of any changes or alterations to these marks during evaluation stage.	None
The GETE also enquired whether a formal Tender Committee was appointed for the technical and financial evaluation of the bids and whether the Airport Authority of India, as the owner, was associated in the technical evaluation.	None
It was informed to the GETE that there was no Tender Committee per se and the assignment of marks to the subfactors was done entirely by the EC.	None
(The Global Consultants)	None
and at no stage Airport Authority of India was associated in assessing and assigning the marks.	None
The GETE was informed that the E.C. had taken about one and a half months to complete this exercise, scrutinizing about 40,000 pages of submissions.	None
2.3 The GETE again met on 4th January, 2006 when ABN AMROs letter dated 3rd January, 2006 in reply to queries raised was handed over to the GETE (Annexure B.).	None
From this letter it appears interse weightage and marks to the subfactors were finalized prior to assigning scores on the offers, but there was no categorical assertion that this was finalized before the exercise was started and kept seated.	None
We are only pointing out that since these interse weight ages were not approved by the Government and kept sealed, the possibility of these being changed during the course of evaluation cannot be ruled out.	None
2.4	None
With all the papers made available to the GETE, the need for seeking further clarification from the EC was not felt.	None
Therefore, they were not invited for any further clarification by the GETE.	None
Scrutiny of the evaluation procedure adopted by EC.	None
3.11 We (GETE) did not call for the technical bid papers nor perused the same.	None
We also did not make any attempt for a fresh technical evaluation of the bids by assigning marks to the subcriteria and subfactors.	None
Our attempt was to assess whether the E.C. had assigned weight ages and marks in a logical and transparent manner to the subfactors and whether there has been any bias in favour of or against any of the bidders while assigning marks.	None
For this we relied upon the RFP and the mark sheets attached to the Note prepared for the Committee of Secretaries.	None
3.1.2	None
While examining the assignments of marks to the various bidders we kept in mind the issues raised by the members of the Inter Ministerial Group but we were not solely guided by their views.	None
We also examined in a dispassionate way whether there was any flaw or bias in the exercise of subjectiveness while assigning marks to the different consortiums.	None
Our observations in this matter are briefly given as under 3.1.3 The Global Consultants prepared ITREOI in January, 2004 which was approved by the IMG in February, 2004 but the appointment of the Global Consultants was approved by EGOM in April, 2004.	None
Thus the Consultants started working even before their appointment was approved.	None
3.1.4 From the report of the Govt.	None
Review Committee, it is seen that the Evaluation Committee (E.C.) has stated that their evaluation was not based merely on the submittals but they relied upon some published statistics, information available within their setup and their own perception and understanding of various aspects of Evaluation (Please refer GRCs) report on their meeting dated 23rd/24th November, 2005).	None
This is not in conformity to RFP.	None
x x x 4.2 There are 8 subcriterions in the criteria	None
no.	None
4.1.1 out of which 4 have further subfactors.	None
Similarly there are 11 subcriterions in the criteria 4.1.2 out of which 8 have further subfactors.	None
4.3	None
Through allocation of weightage to different sub criterions were indicated in RFP, weightage to different subfactors were not indicated but was assigned later by EC based on IMG directions.	None
EC has not confirmed explicitly whether these weight ages were assigned before or after opening of bids.	None
Certain anomalies have been observed in the allocation of the weight ages.	None
While equal weightage has been allocated to most of the sub factors unequal allocation has been done in two cases (1.2.2 /1.2.3 3.1.1/3.1.2).	None
The justification given by EC that these subfactors are of different importance is not considered satisfactory and convincing because such a logic can apply to many other subfactors as well.	None
Since weight ages of these sub factors were not mentioned in RFP and allocation of equal weightage has been done in majority of sub factors, we feel the same concept of equal weightage should have been adopted for these two subfactors also.	None
By assigning different weight ages there is room to suspect that some of the bidders have been favoured.	None
4.4.	None
In subfactor 1.1.6, the assessment of performance of commercial operations of major airports covering retail property and other commercial operations was to be done focusing on Airports having nonaeronautical revenue of 40 or more of total revenue.	None
Though non aeronautical earnings of bidder E are only 37, but they have been given 75 marks.	None
This is considered to be in nonconformity of the RFP.	None
The explanation of EC that wording of the Clause did not make the 40 mandatory is not convincing.	None
In any case, since the non aeronautical earnings of E was less than the threshold limit of 40, assigning a high score of 75 was not justified.	None
This should have been of the order of 40 to 50.	None
4.5	None
In subfactor 1.1.8, the assessment of operating in nonOECD countries was to be as per the RFP.	None
Bidder E operating in Mexico, which, is an OECD country, has been awarded 75 marks, which is not in conformity to RFP.	None
The explanation given by EC to IMG that the bidder has Airport development experience in other developing countries like Ecuador, Uruguay and Guatemala, is not considered convincing.	None
Our considered opinion is the track record in improved performance is also to be judged only in the context of a nonOECD country.	None
Therefore, awarding marks against this item is not considered in conformity to the item in RFP. 4.6	None
In subfactor 3.1.2 (proportion of AAI Staff targeted for absorption into JVC by year 3), EC has awarded 50 marks for minimum 40 absorption and remaining 50 on prorata basis between 40 to 100 absorption.	None
Since RFP has stipulated 40 absorption as minimum acceptable and additional weightage has been contemplated for a higher proportion of absorption, we feel it is more reasonable and rational to distribute full marks .	None
to 100 absorption.	None
4.7	None
If moderation of marks for the above mentioned items is done, following reduction in the score of bidder E will take place Image From the above, it is clear that the above moderation clearly disqualifies bidder E in criteria 4.1.1.	None
4.8 Modernization exercise attempted above will not make any material difference in the position of bidders A, C, D and F who will remain still disqualified.	None
In regard to bidder B he will still be well above the qualifying marks of 80.	None
In fact his position would improve marginally.	None
Therefore, we have not attempted to moderate the marks of the other bidders based on our observations of paras 4.3 to 4.6.	None
4.9	None
While scrutinizing the marks for criteria 4.1.2 we have the following observations to make The GETE have not studied the development plan of this bidder or any other bidder for that matter.	None
We have also not discussed this with the GTA (Air Plan).	None
Considering the type of deficiencies in the developmental plans pointed out by AAI, we feel the marking of bidder E has been on a liberal side in regard to subcriteria 6.1 to 6.5.	None
This will also be the marks if we compare the marks scored by bidder B visvis marks scored by bidder E in regard to Delhi Airport as brought out under Image 4.10.	None
Admittedly bidder B has better credentials, for airport development and such vast difference in marks scored by bidder E over bidder B cannot be easily explained.	None
We feel that if the rational approach has been adopted bidder E who now gets qualified by 0.3 marks for Mumbai and by 1.1 marks for Delhi would have been disqualified.	None
4.11	None
Since in any case in our view bidder E gets disqualified on the basis of our assessment contained in Para4.7 above, we are of the opinion that qualifying bidder E technically is not correct.	None
SECOND REPORT OF GETE DATED 13th JANUARY, 2006 x x x Based on the methodology adopted by GETE for moderating the marks of bidder E, we have now moderated the scores of all other bidders as well.	None
Based on this exercise, the marks secured by the different bidders are given in a tabulated form separately for Delhi and Mumbai Airports.	None
A Table showing moderated scores of all the bidders in criteria A (Management Capabilities) for Mumbai Airport Image B Table showing moderated scores of all the bidders in criteria A (Management Capabilities) for Delhi Airport Image As rightly pointed out by learned Counsel for the respondents that if EC felt that the priorities and weight ages as indicated in the RFP were inappropriate, it should have requested AAI GOI to amend the RFP before the bids were received.	None
Interestingly, the modifications were resorted to after the bids were opened.	Reasoning
That is the principal reason for which EGOM appears to have sought views of the COS and the COS was equally entitled to invite a group of experts to examine the matter.	Reasoning
The details relating to the marks allotted to the bids are as follows Delhi airport Image Mumbai Airport Image Learned Counsel for the respondents have emphasized that a curious feature of the four changes is that at least three of them were in principle designed to enable the appellant to get over the shortcomings in its bid.	None
It is to be noted that the appellant had no property development experience.	Reasoning
It had projected less than 40 non aeronautical revenue and had a partner from an OECD country.	Reasoning
The GETEs report shows that even taking these four modifications led to some of the bidders getting more marks.	Reasoning
GVK and others did not cross the bench mark of 80 and even after exclusion of these marks, GMR had more than 80 marks.	Reasoning
It was only the appellant who crossed the threshold of 80 on account of these four variations and fell below 80 when the effect of these four variations was excluded.	Reasoning
Departure from the RFP made by EC after opening the bids can reasonably raise a doubt that EC knew that the modalities would benefit the appellant.	Reasoning
In any event, it is not necessary to go into the question whether EC was partial to the appellant because that is nobodys case, though it has been submitted that after opening the bids, EC made the variations and beneficiary was the appellant.	Reasoning
GETEs report shows that it enunciated the principle to carry out an exercise that would be more in the nature of validation dealing with the four variations made by EC.	Reasoning
GETE also noted that certain issues can be more satisfactorily addressed by process of validation that would involve a reallocation of marks, on the assessment made by the EC of the bids albeit in a manner that would be consistent with the RFP.	Reasoning
It essentially was not an exercise of reevaluation but of a reallocation consistent with RFP.	Reasoning
As noted in GETEs first report, its attempt was to assess whether EC had assigned weight ages and marks in a logical and transparent manner to the subfactors and whether there had been any biased in favour of or against any of the bidders while assigning marks, with reference to the RFP.	Reasoning
While making such examination, the issues raised by the members of IMG were kept in view, but as stated in the report, GETE was not solely guided by their views.	Reasoning
Though the first report itself indicated the reasons as to why the evaluation process containing the moderation exercise was not undertaken in respect of bidders, as desired by EGOM GETE did so and submitted its second report.	Reasoning
Undisputedly, GMR crossed the bench mark of 80 in respect of both the bids while others did not.	Reasoning
Challenge has been made by the appellant to the lowering of the bench mark.	Issue
It is to be noted that the appellant had come into the zone of consideration only because of lowering of the bench mark as otherwise after the modifications were made by GETE, it had not crossed the bench mark.	Reasoning
The appellants stand that if none was found eligible on the basis of 80 bench mark, there should have been a fresh bid, has been answered by the respondents.	Reasoning
It has been pointed out that the number of bidders was small.	Reasoning
The bidders after opening of the bid knew the merits and demerits of all the bids.	Reasoning
There was an urgency for early completion of the airports keeping in view the 2010 Commonwealth Games.	Reasoning
The scope for judicial review of administrative actions has been considered by this Court in various cases.	Reasoning
One of the points that falls for determination is the scope for judicial interference in matters of administrative decisions.	Issue
Administrative action is stated to be referable to broad area of Governmental activities in which the repositories of power may exercise every class of statutory function of executive, quasilegislative and quasijudicial nature.	None
It is trite law that exercise of power, whether legislative or administrative, will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary (See State of U.P. and Ors.	None
v. Renusagar Power Co. and Ors. AIR1988SC1737 ).	None
At one time, the traditional view in England was that the executive was not answerable where its action was attributable to the exercise of prerogative power.	None
Professor De Smith in his classical work Judicial Review of Administrative Action 4th Edition at pages 285287 states the legal position in his own terse language that the relevant principles formulated by the Courts may be broadly summarized as follows.	None
The authority in which a discretion is vested can be compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner.	Reasoning
In general, a discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is committed.	Reasoning
That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it it must not act under the dictates of another body or disable itself from exercising a discretion in each individual case.	Reasoning
In the purported exercise of its discretion, it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has not been authorized to do.	Reasoning
It must act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations and must not be influenced by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously.	Reasoning
These several principles can conveniently be grouped in two main categories (i) failure to exercise a discretion, and (ii) excess or abuse of discretionary power.	Reasoning
The two classes are not, however, mutually exclusive.	Reasoning
Thus, discretion may be improperly fettered because irrelevant considerations have been taken into account, and where an authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires.	Reasoning
The present trend of judicial opinion is to restrict the doctrine of immunity from judicial review to those class of cases which relate to deployment of troupes, entering into international treaties, etc.	Reasoning
The distinctive features of some of these recent cases signify the willingness of the Courts to assert their power to scrutinize the factual basis upon which discretionary powers have been exercised.	Reasoning
One can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review.	Reasoning
The first ground is illegality the second irrationality, and the third procedural impropriety.	Reasoning
These principles were highlighted by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service 1984 (3) All.	Reasoning
ER.935, (commonly known as CCSU Case).	Reasoning
If the power has been exercised on a nonconsideration or non application of mind to relevant factors, the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous.	Reasoning
If a power (whether legislative or administrative) is exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous, such exercise of power will stand vitiated.	Reasoning
(See Commissioner of Incometax v. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. 1983144ITR225(SC) ).	Reasoning
The effect of several decisions on the question of jurisdiction have been summed up by Graham Aldus and John Alder in their book Applications for Judicial Review, Law and Practice thus There is a general presumption against ousting the jurisdiction of the Courts, so that statutory provisions which purport to exclude judicial review are construed restrictively.	None
There are, however, certain areas of governmental activity, national security being the paradigm , which the Courts regard themselves as incompetent to investigate, beyond an initial decision as to whether the governments claim is bona fide.	None
In this kind of nonjusticiable area judicial review is not entirely excluded, but very limited.	None
It has also been said that powers conferred by the Royal Prerogative are inherently unreviewable but since the speeches of the House of Lords in council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service this is doubtful.	None
Lords Diplock, Scaman and Roskili appeared to agree that there is no general distinction between powers, based upon whether their source is statutory or prerogative but that judicial review can be limited by the subject matter of a particular power, in that case national security.	None
May prerogative powers are in fact concerned with sensitive, nonjusticiable areas, for example, foreign affairs, but some are reviewable in principle, including the prerogatives relating to the civil service where national security is not involved.	None
Another nonjusticiable power is the Attorney Generals prerogative to decide whether to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the public interest.	None
(Also see Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food LR (1968)	None
AC 997.	None
The Court will be slow to interfere in such matters relating to administrative functions unless decision is tainted by any vulnerability enumerated above like illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety.	None
Whether action falls within any of the categories has to be established.	None
Mere assertion in that regard would not be sufficient.	None
The famous case commonly known as The Waynesburgs Case is treated as the landmark so far as laying down various basic principles relating to judicial review of administrative or statutory direction.	None
Before summarizing the substance of the principles laid down therein we shall refer to the passage from the judgment of Lord Greene in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation (KB at p. 229	None
All ER p. 682).	None
It reads as follows It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably.	None
Now what does that mean?	None
Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word unreasonable in a rather comprehensive sense.	None
It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done.	None
For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law.	None
He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider.	None
He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider.	None
If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting unreasonably.	None
Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers the authorityIn another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters.	None
It is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith and in fact, all these things run into one another.	None
Lord Greene also observed (KB p.230 All ER p.683) it must be proved to be unreasonable in the sense that the court considers it to be a decision that no reasonable body can come to.	None
It is not what the court considers unreasonable The effect of the legislation is not to set up the court as an arbiter of the correctness of one view over another.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
Therefore, to arrive at a decision on reasonableness the Court has to find out if the administrator has left out relevant factors or taken into account irrelevant factors.	Reasoning
The decision of the administrator must have been within the four corners of the law, and not one which no sensible person could have reasonably arrived at, having regard to the above principles, and must have been a bona fide one.	Reasoning
The decision could be one of many choices open to the authority but it was for that authority to decide upon the choice and not for the Court to substitute its view.	Reasoning
The principles of judicial review of administrative action were further summarized in 1985 by Lord Diplock in CCSU case as illegality, procedural impropriety and irrationality.	None
He said more grounds could in future become available, including the doctrine of proportionality which was a principle followed by certain other members of the European Economic Community.	None
Lord Diplock observed in that case as follows Judicial review has I think, developed to a stage today when, without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review.	None
The first ground I would call illegality, the second irrationality and the third procedural impropriety.	Reasoning
That is not to say that further development on a casebycase basis may not in course of time add further grounds.	None
I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of proportionality which is recognized in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the European Economic Community.	None
Lord Diplock explained irrationality as follows By irrationality I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness.	None
It applies to a decision which is to outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.	None
In other words, to characterize a decision of the administrator as irrational the Court has to hold, on material, that it is a decision so outrageous as to be in total defiance of logic or moral standards.	Reasoning
Adoption of proportionality into administrative law was left for the future.	Reasoning
In essence, the test is to see whether there is any infirmity in the decision making process and not in the decision itself.	Reasoning
(See Indian Railway Construction Co. Ltd. v. Ajay Kumar (2003)IILLJ150SC )	Reasoning
Wednesbury principles of reasonableness to which reference has been made in almost all the decisions referred to hereinabove is contained in Wednesburys case (supra).	None
In that case Lord Green MR has held that a decision of a public authority will be liable to be quashed in judicial review proceeding where the court concludes that the decision is such that no authority properly directing itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably could have arrived it.	None
The standards of judicial review in terms of Wednesbury is now considered to be traditional in England in contrast to higher standards under the common law of human rights.	None
Lord Cooke in R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Daly (2001) 3	None
All ER 433 observed And I think that the day will come when it will be more widely recognized that the Wednesbury case was an unfortunately retrogressive decision in English administrative law, in so far as it suggested that there are degrees of unreasonableness and that only a very extreme degree can bring an administrative decision within the legitimate scope of judicial invalidation.	None
The depth of judicial review and the deference due to administrative discretion vary with the subject matter.	None
It may well be, however, that the law can never be satisfied in any administrative field merely by a finding that the decision under review is not capricious or absurd.	None
It is further observed that this does not mean that there has been a shift to merits review.	None
On the contrary, the respective roles of judges and administrators are fundamentally distinct and will remain so.	None
To this extent the general tenor of the observations in R (Mahmood) v. Secretary of State for the Home Dept. (2000) 1 WLR 840 are correct.	None
And Laws L.J. (at 847 (para 18) rightly emphasized in Mahmoods case that the intensity of review in a public law case will depend on the subject matter in hand.	None
(underlined for emphasis)	None
In Huang and Ors.	None
v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005)	None
3	None
All ER 435 it is observed 50the depth of judicial review and the deference due to administrative discretion vary with the subject matter.	None
Can we find a principled approach to give this proposition concrete effect in cases such as these appeals?	None
In R (on the application of ProLife Alliance) v. BBC 2003 (2) All ER 977 Lord Hoffmann said My Lords, although the word deference is now very popular in describing the relationship between the judicial and the other branches of government, I do not think that its overtones of servility, or perhaps gracious concession, are appropriate to describe what is happening.	None
In a society based upon the rule of law and the separation of powers, it is necessary to decide which branch of government has in any particular instance the decisionmaking power and what the legal limits of that power are.	None
That is a question of law and must therefore be decided by the courts.	None
(underlined for emphasis) Section 9 of the Judicial Review Procedure Act, 1996 (Canada) states that the Court may reject an application for judicial review of a statutory power of decision, if there is mere irregularity in form or a technical irregularity, or if the court feels that there has been no miscarriage of justice.	None
Chapter 5 of the US Code 41 also talks about judicial review of administrative decisions regarding public contracts.	None
It states that the courts would not interfere in an award process unless it is shown to be manifestly fraudulent, capricious and so grossly erroneous as to imply bad faith.	None
While exercising power of judicial review courts should not proceed where if two views are possible and one view has been taken.	None
In such a case, in the absence of mala fide taking one of the views cannot be a ground for judicial review.	None
In Asia Foundation Construction Ltd. v. Trafalgar House Construction (I) Ltd. and Ors.	None
(1997)1SCC738 this Court observed as follows The Asian Development Bank came into existence under an Act called the Asian Development Act, 1966, in pursuance of an international agreement to which India was a signatory.	None
This new financial institution was established for accelerating the economic development of Asia and the Far East.	None
Under the Act the Bank and its officers have been granted certain immunities, exemption and privileges.	None
It is well known that it is difficult for the country to go ahead with such high cost projects unless the financial institutions like the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank grant loan or subsidy, as the case may be.	None
When such financial institutions grant such huge loans they always insist that any project for which loan has been sanctioned must be carried out in accordance with the specification and within the scheduled time and the procedure for granting the award must be duly adhered to.	None
In the aforesaid premises on getting the evaluation bids of the appellant and Respondent1 together with the consultants opinion after the socalled corrections made the conclusion of the Bank to the effect the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder is consequently AFCONS cannot be said to be either arbitrary or capricious or illegal requiring Courts interference in the matter of an award of contract.	None
There was some dispute between the Bank on one hand and the consultant who was called upon to evaluate on the other on the question whether there is any power of making any correction to the bid documents after a specified period.	None
The High Court in construing certain clauses of the bid documents has come to the conclusion that such a correction was permissible and, therefore, the Bank could not have insisted upon granting the contract in favour of the appellant.	None
We are of the considered opinion that it was not within the permissible limits of interference for a court of law, particularly when there has been no allegation of malice or ulterior motive and particularly when the court has not found any mala fides or favouritism in the grant of contract in favour of the appellant.	None
In Tata Cellular v. Union of India AIR1996SC11 , this Court has held that The duty of the court is to confine itself to the question of legality.	None
Its concern should be Whether a decisionmaking authority exceeded its powers, 2. committed an error of law, 3. committed a breach of the rules of natural justice, 4. reached a decision which no reasonable tribunal would have reached or, 5. abused its powers.	None
Therefore, it is not for the Court to determine whether a particular policy or particular decision taken in the fulfilment of that policy is fair.	None
It is only concerned with the manner in which those decisions have been taken.	None
The extent of the duty to act fairly will vary from case to case.	None
Shortly put, the grounds upon which an administrative action is subject to control by judicial review can be classified as under Illegality	None
This means the decisionmaker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and must give effect to it Irrationality, namely, Wednesbury unreasonableness.	None
Procedural impropriety.	None
The above are only the broad grounds but it does not rule out addition of further grounds in course of time.	None
Therefore, though the principle of judicial review cannot be denied so far as exercise of contractual powers of government bodies are concerned, but it is intended to prevent arbitrariness or favouritism and it is exercised in the larger public interest or if it is brought to the notice of the court that in the matter of award of a contract power has been exercised for any collateral purpose.	None
But on examining the facts and circumstances of the present case and on going through the records we are of the considered opinion that none of the criteria has been satisfied justifying Courts interference in the grant of contract in favour of the appellant.	None
We are not entering into the controversy raised by Mr. Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel that the High Court committed a factual error in coming to the conclusion that Respondent1 was the lowest bidder and the alleged mistake committed by the consultant in the matter of bid evaluation in not taking into account the customs duty and the contention of Mr. Sorabjee, learned senior counsel that it has been conceded by all parties concerned before the High Court that on corrections being made respondent1 was the lowest bidder.	None
As in our view in the matter of a tender a lowest bidder may not claim an enforceable right to get the contract though ordinarily the authorities concerned should accept the lowest bid.	None
Further we find from the letter dated 12.7.1996 that Paradip Port Trust itself has come to the following conclusion The technical capability of any of the three bidders to undertake the works is not in question.	None
Two of the bids are very similar in price.	None
If additional commercial information which has now been provided by bidders through Paradip Port Trust, had been available at the time of assessment, the outcome would appear to favour the award to AFCONS.	None
This being the position, in our considered opinion, the High Court was not justified in interfering with the award by going into different clauses of the bid document and then coming to the conclusion that the terms provided for modifications or corrections even after a specified date and further coming to the conclusion that Respondent 1 being the lowest bidder there was no reason for the Port Trust to award the contract in favour of the appellant.	None
We cannot lose sight of the fact of escalation of cost in such project on account of delay and the time involved and further in a coordinated project like this, if one component is not worked out the entire project gets delayed and the enormous cost on that score if rebinding is done.	None
The High Court has totally lost sight of this fact while directing the rebinding.	None
In our considered opinion, the direction of rebinding in the facts and circumstances of the present case instead of being in the public interest would be grossly detrimental to the public interest.	None
It is also to be noted that there was no stand before the High Court that the appellant wanted to match the bid.	Reasoning
Even if it is accepted for the sake of argument, that was so urged it would have no consequence.	None
A very attractive argument was advanced that as GMR has been allowed to match the financial dealing of appellant for Mumbai airport, the same modality should have been adopted for the other bidders.	Reasoning
Though the argument is attractive, at first flush, it cannot be accepted for the simple reason that when bench mark is crossed, financial consideration is the determinative factor because of revenue sharing.	Reasoning
It is to be noted that though emphasis was led that the constitution of Committees of non technical persons could not have thrown much light on the ultimate decision, yet it is to be noted that all the three Committees were part of the government machinery.	Reasoning
The issue was to assess correctness of the ECs decision.	Reasoning
Expression of different views and discussions in different meetings really lead to a transparent process and transparency in the decision making process.	Reasoning
In the realms of contract, various choices were available.	Reasoning
Comparison of the respective merits, offers of choice and whether that choice has been properly exercised are the deciding factors in the judicial review.	Reasoning
As has been rightly submitted by learned Counsel for the Union of India, the RFP has to be considered in the context of other documents like substantial document OMDA, execution of the agreements culminating to the final master plan.	Reasoning
Initial development plan is nothing but a projection which has to be broadly in line with OMDA.	Reasoning
Undisputedly, OMDA is prepared by the GOI and AAI.	Reasoning
One of the documents in the transaction documents is OMDA.	Reasoning
It is to be noted that if no one was qualified, two alternatives were available either to scrap or abandon the process and second to reconduct the tenders.	Reasoning
As noted above, the practical compulsion which made the choice avoidable cannot be termed as perverse or lacking rationality.	Reasoning
The safety valve is the OMDA.	Reasoning
The ranking becomes irrelevant after the bidders have come to the arena and then finally the financial bid which determines the ultimate bid.	Reasoning
It is to be noted that GETE wanted to know as to whether the variation for allotment of marks in respect of the development side area was done before opening the bids or after opening it.	Reasoning
EC had given a very evasive answer stating that same was done before allotting marks.	Reasoning
GETEs job was not the evaluation but verifying the evaluation process.	Reasoning
GETEs examination was restricted to see whether alignment with RFP was correctly done.	Reasoning
GETE was not expected to give fresh opinion and no evaluation was necessary.	Reasoning
Weightage introduces subjectivity.	Reasoning
GETE has gone by objective standards.	Reasoning
The criterion adopted by GETE appears to be more rational.	Reasoning
It proceeded with the idea that more objectivity was necessary.	Reasoning
So it has called the process to be validation process.	Reasoning
It is pointed out by learned Counsel for the respondents that parameters for judicial review are different in the matters of contract for normal case of tenders.	Reasoning
In case of commercial contracts the normal contractual matters are excluded.	Reasoning
It is pointed out that there is no overwhelming public interest involving such matters.	Reasoning
GETE had only touched the fallacious approach of EC to make the process transparent.	Reasoning
The view taken is a possible view supported by reasons and there should not be any interference.	Reasoning
In the ultimate, the question would be whether in the process of selection the Government had adopted transparent and fair process.	Reasoning
While balancing several claims a rational approach is necessary and that is to be formed in line with the scope of judicial interference.	Reasoning
It is to be noted that Clause 5.5.	Reasoning
deals with a situation of the same bidder being the highest bidder for both the airports.	Reasoning
It proceeds on the basis that there would be another eligible bidder for the other airport and on that basis the procedure to be adopted has been prescribed.	Reasoning
In such a situation the bidder who would be successful i.e. the highest bidder would be asked to take the airport when the difference between his bid and the next higher bid is greater.	Reasoning
Such a procedure could be followed where there is second valid bid at the final phase.	Reasoning
This procedure does not deal with a situation where there is only one bidder with valid bids for both the airports.	Reasoning
In such a situation he becomes the highest bidder for both the airports and for that reason alone, the question of evaluation of financial bid arises.	Reasoning
If the RFP was to consider at the final phase of evaluation there would be only one bid for each of the airports.	Reasoning
In that event, there would be no question of finding out difference between the various bids or comparing bids.	Reasoning
That left no option with the EGOM but to either vary RFP or to award one of the airports to GMR and to cancel the process for the second or cancel the entire process.	Reasoning
The latter course would not have been in larger public interest.	Reasoning
Therefore, the EGOM exercised its option.	Reasoning
In final analysis, what the EGOM has done is to accept the report of EC subject to validation done by GETE.	None
The extent of judicial review in a case of this nature where the texture cannot be matched with one relating to award of contract, the observations of this Court in Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R. Construction Ltd. and Ors. AIR1999SC393 are relevant.	None
It was observed as follows Hence before entertaining a writ petition and passing any interim orders in such petitions, the court must carefully weigh conflicting public interests.	None
Only when it comes to a conclusion that there is an overwhelming public interest in entertaining the petition, the court should intervene.	None
The view was reiterated in Master Marine Services (P) Ltd. v. Metcalfe Hodgkinson (P) Ltd. and Anr.	None
AIR2005SC2299 .	None
In the Queens Bench decision in R. v. Department of Constitutional Affairs 2006 All ER (D) 101	None
it was inter alia held as follows It is not every wandering from the precise paths of best practice that lends fuel to a claim for judicial review.	None
Same would be available only if public law element is apparent which would arise only in a case of bribery, corruption, implementation of unlawful policy and the like.	None
In the case of commercial contract, the aforesaid view about wandering was noted.	None
In paras 50 and 51 it was noted as follows It does not have the material or expertise in this context to second guess the judgment of the panel.	None
Furthermore, this process is even more clearly in the realm of commercial judgment for the defendant, which judgment cannot properly be the subject of Public Law challenge on the grounds advanced in the evidence before me.	None
It is to be noted that in respect of both the appellant and the GETE wherever subjectivity criteria is involved, GETE has not dealt with the same.	None
The mandate of EGOM was to validate and not to invalidate.	Reasoning
It was a process for overall validation and calibration to apply the correct standard.	Reasoning
It is the texture of the tendered document which is of paramount importance.	Reasoning
EC has changed the texture whereas GETE did not do it.	Reasoning
It needs no emphasis that uneven denomination breaks the integrity and textures.	Reasoning
Perverseness in connection with a finding of fact is an aspect of mistake of law.	Reasoning
Linked with the question whether GETEs constitution was legal, other question is whether the jurisdiction conferred on GETE has been properly exercised.	Reasoning
Examination of the second question alone would be necessary since we have held that constitution of GETE does not suffer from any infirmity.	Reasoning
In R (Iran) v. Secretary of State 2005 EWCA Civ 982 it was observed as follows It is well known that perversity represents a very high hurdle.	None
In Miftari v. SSHD 2005 EWCA 481 the whole court agreed that the word meant what it said it was a demanding concept.	None
The majority of the court (Keene and Maurice Kay LJJ) said that it embraced decisions that were irrational or unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense (even if there was no wilful or conscious departure from the rational), but it also included a finding of fact that was wholly unsupported by the evidence, provided always that this was a finding as to a material matter.	None
Opinions may differ as to when it can be said that in the public law domain, the entire proceeding before the appropriate authority is illegal and without jurisdiction or the defect or infirmity in the order goes to the root of the matter and makes it in law invalid or void.	None
The matter may have to be considered in the light of the provisions of the particular statute in question and the factsituation obtaining in each case.	None
It is difficult to visualise all situations hypothetically and provide an answer.	None
Be that as it may, the question that frequently arises for consideration, is, in what situation cases the non compliance or error or mistake, committed by the statutory authority or tribunal, makes the decision rendered ultra vires or a nullity or one without jurisdiction?	None
If the decision is without jurisdiction, notwithstanding the provisions for obtaining reliefs contained in the Act and the ouster clauses, the jurisdiction of the ordinary court is not excluded.	None
So, the matter assumes significance.	None
Since the landmark decision in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1969) 1	None
ALL E.R. 208 the legal world seems to have accepted that any jurisdictional error as understood in the liberal or modern approach, laid down therein, makes a decision ultra vires or a nullity or without jurisdiction and the ouster clauses are construed restrictively, and such provisions whatever their stringent language be, have been held, not to prevent challenge on the ground that the decision is ultra vires and being a complete nullity, it is not a decision within the meaning of the Act.	None
The concept of jurisdiction has acquired new dimensions.	None
The original or pure theory of jurisdiction means the authority to decide and it is determinable at the commencement and not at the conclusion of the enquiry.	None
The said approach has been given a goby in Anisminic case as we shall see from the discussion hereinafter see De Smith, Woolf and Jowell Judicial Review of Administrative Action (1995 Edn.)	None

The decision in Anisminic case (supra) has been cited with approval in a number of cases by this Court.(See Union of India v. Tarachand Gupta Bros. 1983(13)ELT1456(SC) , A.R. Antulay v. R.S.

In M.L. Sethi v. R.P.	None
Kapur 19731SCR697 legal position after Anisminic case (supra) was explained to the following effect 12	None
The word jurisdiction is a verbal coat of many colours.	None
Jurisdiction originally seems to have had the meaning which Lord Reid ascribed to it in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission, namely, the entitlement to enter upon the enquiry in question.	None
If there was an entitlement to enter upon an enquiry into the question, then any subsequent error could only be regarded as an error within the jurisdiction.	None
The best known formulation of this theory is that made by Lord Darman in R. v. Bolton (1841) 1 QB 66.	None
He said that the question of jurisdiction is determinable at the commencement, not at the conclusion of the enquiry.	None
In Anisminic Ltd., Lord Reid said But there are many cases where, although the tribunal had jurisdiction to enter on the enquiry, it has done or failed to do something in the course of the enquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity.	None
It may have given its decision in bad faith.	None
It may have made a decision which it had no power to make.	None
It may have failed in the course of the enquiry to comply with the requirements of natural justice.	None
It may in perfect good faith have misconstrued the provisions giving it power to act so that it failed to deal with the question remitted to it and decided some question which was not remitted to it.	None
It may have refused to take into account something which it was required to take into account.	None
Or it may have based its decision on some matter which, under the provisions setting it up, it had no right to take into account.	None
I do not intend this list to be exhaustive.	None
In the same case, Lord Pearce said Lack of jurisdiction may arise in various ways.	None
There may be an absence of those formalities or things which are conditions precedent to the tribunal having any jurisdiction to embark on an enquiry.	None
Or the tribunal may at the end make an order that it has no jurisdiction to make.	None
Or in the intervening stage while engaged on a proper enquiry, the tribunal may depart from the rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the wrong questions or it may take into account matters which it was not directed to take into account.	None
Thereby it would step outside its jurisdiction.	None
It would turn into its enquiry into something not directed by Parliament and fail to make the enquiry which Parliament did direct.	None
Any of these things would cause its purported decision to be a nullity.	None
The dicta of the majority of the House of Lords, in the above case would show the extent to which lack and excess of jurisdiction have been assimilated or, in other words, the extent to which we have moved away from the traditional concept of jurisdiction.	None
The effect of the dicta in that case is to reduce the difference between jurisdictional error and error of law within jurisdiction almost to vanishing point.	None
The practical effect of the decision is that any error of law can be reckoned as jurisdictional.	None
This comes perilously close to saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right in law but none if it is wrong.	None
Almost any misconstruction of a statute can be represented as basing their decision on a matter with which they have no right to deal, imposing an unwarranted condition or addressing themselves to a wrong question.	None
The majority opinion in the case leaves a court or tribunal with virtually no margin of legal error.	None
Whether there is excess of jurisdiction or merely error within jurisdiction can be determined only by construing the empowering statute, which will give little guidance.	None
It is really a question of how much latitude the court is prepared to allow In the subsequent Constitution Bench decision in Hari Prasad Mulshanker Trivedi v. V.B. Raju and Ors.	None
19741SCR548 , it was held as follows Though the dividing line between lack of jurisdiction or power and erroneous exercise of it has become thin with the decision of the House of Lords in the Anisminic case (i.e. Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1967)	None
2	None
All E.R. 986 we do not think that the distinction between the two has been completely wiped out.	None
We are aware of the difficulty in formulating an exhaustive rule to tell when there is lack of power and when there is an erroneous exercise of it.	None
The difficulty has arisen because the word jurisdiction is an expression which is used in a variety of senses and takes its colour from its context, (see per Diplock, J. at p. 394 in the Anisminic case).	None
Whereas the pure theory of jurisdiction would reduce jurisdictional control to a vanishing point, the adoption of a narrower meaning might result in a more useful legal concept even though the formal structure of law may lose something of its logical symmetry.	None
At bottom the problem of defining the concept of jurisdiction for purpose of judicial review has been one of public policy rather than one of logic.	None
S.A. Smith, Judicial Review of Administrative Action, 2nd Edn., p. 98. (1968 Edn.)	None
The observation of the learned author, (S.A. De Smith) was continued in its 3rd Edn.	None
(1973) at p.98 and in its 4th Edn.	None
(1980) at p. 112 of the book.	None
The observation aforesaid was based on the then prevailing academic opinion only as is seen from the footnotes.	None
It should be stated that the said observation is omitted from the latest edition of the book De Smith, Woolf and Jowell Judicial Review of Administrative Action 5th Edn.	None
(1995) as is evident from p. 229 probably due to later developments in the law and the academic opinion that has emerged due to the change in the perspective.	None
After 1980, the decision in first Anisminics case came up for further consideration before the House of Lords, Privy Council and other courts.	None
The three leading decisions of the House of Lords wherein Anisminic principle was followed and explained, are the following Re Racal Communications Ltd. (1980) 2 All E.R. 634 O	None

v. Hull University Visitor (1993) 1	None
All E.R. 97.	None
It should be noted that Racal, in re case (supra) the Anisminic principle was held to be inapplicable in the case of (superior) court where the decision of the court is made final and conclusive by the statute.	None
(The superior court referred to in this decision is the High Court) 1981 AC 374.	None
In the meanwhile, the House of Lords in CCSU case (supra) enunciated three broad grounds for judicial review, as legality, procedural propriety and rationality and this decision had its impact on the development of the law in postAnisminic period.	None
In the light of the above four important decisions of the House of Lords, other decisions of the Court of appeal, Privy Council etc. and the later academic opinion in the matter the entire caselaw on the subject has been reviewed in leading text books.	None
In the latest edition of De Smith on Judicial Review of Administrative Actionedited by Lord Woolf and Jowell, Q.C. Professor of Public Law, 5th Edn. 1995, in Chapter 5, titled as Jurisdiction, Vires, Law and Fact (pp.223294), there is exhaustive analysis about the concept Jurisdiction and its ramifications.	None
The authors have discussed the pure theory of jurisdiction, the innovative decision in Anisminic case, the development of the law in postAnisminic period, the scope of the finality clauses (exclusion of jurisdiction of courts) in the statutes, and have laid down a few propositions at pp. 250256 which could be advanced on the subject.	None
The authors have concluded the discussion thus at p. 256	None
After Anisminic	None
virtually every error of law is a jurisdictional error, and the only place left for nonjurisdictional error is where the components of the decision made by the inferior body included matters of fact and policy as well as law, or where the error was evidential (concerning for example the burden of proof or admission of evidence).	None
Perhaps the most precise indication of jurisdictional error is that advanced by Lord Diplock in Racal Communications, when he suggested that a tribunal is entitled to make an error when the matter involves, as may do interrelated questions of law, fact and degree.	None
Thus it was for the county court judge in Pearlman to decide whether the installation of central heating in a dwelling amounted to a structural, alteration, extension or addition.	None
This was a typical question of mixed law, fact and degree which only a scholiast would think it appropriate to dissect into two separate questions, one for decision by the superior court, viz., the meaning of these words, a question which must entail considerations of degree, and the other for decision by a county court viz., the application of words to the particular installation, a question which also entails considerations of degree.	None
It is, however, doubtful whether any test of jurisdictional error will prove satisfactory.	None
The distinction between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional error is ultimately based upon foundations of sand.	None
Much of the superstructure has already crumbled.	None
What remains is likely quickly to fall away as the courts rightly insist that all administrative action should be, simply, lawful, whether or not jurisdictionally lawful.	None
The jurisdictional control exercised by superior courts over subordinate courts, tribunals or other statutory bodies and the scope and content of such power has been pithily stated in Halsburys Laws of England  4th Edn.	None
(Reissue), 1989 Vol. 1(1), p. 113 to the following effect The inferior court or tribunal lacks jurisdiction if it has no power to enter upon an enquiry into a matter at all	None
and it exceeds jurisdiction if it nevertheless enters upon such an enquiry or, having jurisdiction in the first place, it proceeds to arrogate an authority withheld from it by perpetrating a major error of substance, form or procedure, or by making an order or taking action outside its limited area of competence.	None
Not every error committed by an inferior court or tribunal or other body, however, goes to jurisdiction.	None
Jurisdiction to decide a matter imports a limited power to decide that matter incorrectly.	None
A tribunal lacks jurisdiction if (1) it is improperly constituted, or (2) the proceedings have been improperly instituted, or (3) authority to decide has been delegated to it unlawfully, or (4) it is without competence to deal with a matter by reason of the parties, the area in which the issue arose, the nature of the subjectmatter, the value of that subjectmatter, or the non existence of any other prerequisite of a valid adjudication.	None
Excess of jurisdiction is not materially distinguishable from lack of jurisdiction and the expressions may be used interchangeably.	None
Where the jurisdiction of a tribunal is dependent on the existence of a particular state of affairs, that state of affairs may be described as preliminary to, or collateral to the merits of, the issue, or as jurisdictional.	None
(p. 114).	None
There is a presumption in construing statutes which confer jurisdiction or discretionary powers on a body, that if that body makes an error of law while purporting to act within that jurisdiction or in exercising those powers, its decision or action will exceed the jurisdiction conferred and will be quashed.	None
The error must be one on which the decision or action depends.	None
An error of law going to jurisdiction may be committed by a body which fails to follow the proper procedure required by law, which takes legally irrelevant considerations into account, or which fails to take relevant considerations into account, or which asks itself and answers the wrong question.	None
(pp. 119120)	None
The presumption that error of law goes to jurisdiction may be rebutted on the construction of a particular statute, so that the relevant body will not exceed its jurisdiction by going wrong in law.	None
Previously, the courts were more likely to find that errors of law were within jurisdiction but with the modern approach errors of law will be held to fall within a bodys jurisdiction only in exceptional cases.	None
The Court will generally assume that their expertise in determining the principles of law applicable in any case has not been excluded by Parliament.(p. 120).	None
Errors of law include misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule of common law asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts admitting inadmissible evidence or rejecting admissible and relevant evidence exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof.	None
(pp.121 122) H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth in their book  Administrative Law, 7th Edn., (1994)  discuss the subject regarding the jurisdiction of superior courts over subordinate courts and tribunals under the head Jurisdiction over Fact and Law in Chapter 9, pp. 284320.	None
The decisions before Anisminic and those in the post  Anisminic period have been discussed in detail.	None
At pp. 319320, the authors give the Summary of Rules thus Jurisdiction over fact and law	None
Summary	None
At the end of a chapter which is top heavy with obsolescent material, it may be useful to summarise the position as shortly as possible.	None
The overall picture is of an expanding system struggling to free itself from the trammels of classical doctrines laid down in the past.	None
It is not safe to say that the classical doctrines are wholly obsolete and that the broad and simple principles of review, which clearly now commend themselves to the judiciary, will entirely supplant them.	None
A summary can therefore only state the longestablished rules together with and broader rules which have now superseded them, much for the benefit of the law.	None
Together they are as follows Errors of fact Old rule The court would quash only if the erroneous jurisdictional.	None
New rule The court will quash if an erroneous and decisive fact was  (a) jurisdictional (b) found on the basis of no evidence or (c) wrong, misunderstood or ignored.	None
Errors of law Old rule The court would quash only if the error was (a) jurisdictional or (b) on the face of the record.	None
New rule The court will quash for any decisive error because all errors of law are now jurisdictional.	None

Stand of respondents about appellants objectionable conduct needs consideration.	Reasoning
Para 1.3 of RFP reads as follows 1.3.	Reasoning
Confidentiality PQB receiving this RFP must have completed and returned the required, duly executed Confidentiality Deed.	Reasoning
PQB are reminded that information provided in this RFP and the accompanying documentation package is covered by the terms of the Confidentiality Deed and the Disclaimer set out herein.	Reasoning
PQB are also reminded that they are not to make any public statements about the Transaction process or their participation in it.	Reasoning
Para 6.13 speaks of the Contract Points and in no uncertain terms provides as follows Any request for information or clarification of information must be directed through the questions and answer process set out in Section 3. 3 hereof.	Reasoning
PQB and their advisers must not make contact with any employees of AAI or other GOI agencies or airport customers except as arranged through ABN AMRO as part of the Transaction process.	Reasoning
Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the expression contract obviously means an illegal attempt for bribery etc. and cannot stand on the way of submission of documents for consideration.	Reasoning
The plea is clearly untenable.	Reasoning
Though, there is no penal clause for such breach it goes against a very concept of fairness in the process and evaluation of bids.	Reasoning
Whatever documents are to be submitted are clearly stipulated.	Reasoning
Any attempt to take advantage of any newspaper report, clearly falls foul of the mandate that there shall not be any contract with any person involved in the process of selection.	Reasoning
It is unusual that the RFP did not make such a contract is a factor for disqualification.	Reasoning
This is to be kept in view in future tenders.	Reasoning
The inevitable conclusion is that the appeal is sans merit, deserves dismissal, which we direct.	Decision
Costs made easy.	Decision
H. Kapadia, J.	None
Although, I respectfully agree with the conclusion contained in the opinion of brother, Arijit Pasayat, the importance of the scoring system in the tender process has impelled me to elucidate and clarify certain crucial aspects.	None
Hence, this separate opinion.	None
The basic controversy in the present case is whether the E.G. had exceeded its authority in the assessment of technical prequalification.	Issue
In the scoring system objectivity has an. important role to play (Clause 5.4).	None
In the scoring system the identification of factors (including subfactors), allocation of marks to each of these factors (including subfactors) and giving of marks are three distinct and different stages.	None
Clause 5.4 dealt with assessment of technical prequalifications.	None
Under that clause a scoring system was to be applied based on the assessment of the Terms of the Offer against the Technical Prequalification criteria.	None
It further stipulated that assessment shall be on absolute basis and not relative as between the offers.	None
Under the said system, each factor had to be allocated certain marks.	None
Objectivity had to be provided in the allocation of marks (and not in giving of marks) to each factor (including subfactors).	None
This was not done.	None
For example, RFP required certain marks to be allocated for absorption of existing staff.	None
Greater the absorption, higher the marks to be given.	None
In the present case, the E.G. changed the factor, namely, absorption of employees to the overall approach.	None
This led to change in priority.	None
Similarly, in the RFP, the factor earmarked was property development which E.G. compared to infrastructure development.	None
Experience in property development is different from experience in infrastructure development.	None
Similarly, RFP had given weightage to aeronautical revenue whereas in allocation of marks, E.G. obliterated the difference between aeronautical and nonaeronautical revenues.	None
The above examples are given only to show that objectivity which was the underlying principle underlying Clause 5.4.	None
is completely lost either by expanding the enumerated factors like aeronautical revenue, overall capability visvis capacity to absorb existing workforce and comparison of property development with infrastructure development or by allocating uneven marks to subfactors.	None
In my view, E.G. had no business to expand or narrow down the scope of any of the above factors as it was beyond its authority and contrary to the scoring system.	None
With these words, I agree with the conclusion contained in the opinion of brother, Arijit Pasayat.	None
