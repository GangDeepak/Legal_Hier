Facts
Learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently argued that in the present case it would be wholly unsafe for the court to come to any conclusion adverse to the accused on the basis of the circumstances alleged by the prosecution.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel, none of the said circumstances have been conclusively proved.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is specifically contended that apart from PW4, who is the son of the deceased, there is no other witness who had testified on the most vital circumstance of the case, namely, that the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended that certain serious infirmities are inherent in the evidence of PW4 which makes the said witness unworthy of credence.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this regard it is specifically pointed out that the FIR registered at 2.30 P.M. on 29.8.2000 must be understood to be antedated inasmuch as the vehicle and the accused appellants were apprehended in Purnia only at 9.15 P.M of the said day.	Arguments of Petitioner
The recovery of the dead body in no way is connected with the accused no test identification parade was carried out and no recovery of weapons used in the alleged crime has been made by the prosecution.	Arguments of Petitioner
A large number of witnesses vital to the prosecution case had turned hostile.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, according to the learned counsel, none of the circumstances alleged by the prosecution has been proved so as to disclose the involvement of the accused in the alleged crime.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, learned counsel for the State has contended that the evidence of PWs 4 and 8 clearly establish that the accused appellants had hired the vehicle driven by the deceased to go to Haridwar and on the very next morning the dead body of Krishan Kumar was recovered under the bridge from a place near Haridwar.	Arguments of Respondent
The above facts required a reasonable explanation from the accused so as to absolve them from the liability sought to be cast by the prosecution.	Arguments of Respondent
No explanation whatsoever has been forthcoming.	Arguments of Respondent
According to the learned counsel mere denial of the incident by the accused in their statements recorded under Section 313 CrPC will not be sufficient to exonerate them.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel has pointed out that prosecution in the present case has proved highly incriminating circumstances against the accused, namely, that they were last seen in the company of the deceased and within a span of about 18 hours thereafter the dead body of Krishan Kumar was recovered from Haridwar.	Arguments of Respondent
Alongwith the vehicle the accused were apprehended in Purnia, Bihar.	Arguments of Respondent
They have failed to account for the absence of the deceased their presence in Bihar with the vehicle and the recovery of the dead body of Krishan Kumar at Haridwar.	Arguments of Respondent
In these circumstances, according to the learned counsel for the State, there can be no doubt that it is the accused alone who are responsible for the death of deceased Krishan Kumar.	Arguments of Respondent
The prosecution case hinges on circumstantial evidence as no direct evidence of the commission of the crime is forthcoming.	None
The test(s) that have to be applied by the court to hold a prosecution case to be proved beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of circumstantial evidence has been laid down in a plethora of judgments of this Court.	None
In a recent pronouncement in the case of Vadlakonda Lenin Vs.	None
State of A.P. (2012) 12 SCC 260 the law has been summed up in paragraph 12 which may be usefully extracted hereinbelow ?	None
12.	None
The culpability of the appellantaccused, in the absence of any direct evidence, has to be judged on the basis of the circumstances enumerated above.	None
The principles of law governing proof of a criminal charge by circumstantial evidence would hardly require any reiteration save and except that the circumstances on which the prosecution relies must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt and such circumstances must be capable of giving rise to an inference which is inconsistent with any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused.	None
It is only in such an event that the conviction of the accused, on the basis of the circumstantial evidence brought by the prosecution, would be permissible in law.	None
In this regard a reference to the ?five golden principles?	None
enunciated by this Court in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1984) 4 SCC 116 may be recapitulated for which purpose para 153 of the judgment in the above case may be usefully extracted below ?	None
153.	None
A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established (1) the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.	None
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned ?must or should?	None
and not ?may be?	None
established.	None
There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between ?may be proved?	None
and ?must be or should be proved?	None
as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade v. State of Maharashtra (1973 2 SCC 793 ) where the following observations were made ?19. ?	None
Certainly, it is a primary principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the mental distance between ?may be?	None
and ?must be?	None
is long and divides vague conjectures from sure conclusions.?	None
(emphasis in original) (2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, (4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.?	None
Due consideration of the evidence on record makes it abundantly clear that in the present case the prosecution has proved that on 26.8.2000 at about 4.30 p.m. the appellants and two other coaccused were in the van driven by deceased Krishan Kumar and that they had hired the said van to go to Haridwar.	Reasoning
On the next morning at about 10.00 a.m. the dead body of Krishan Kumar (subsequently identified by PWs 11 and 12 on the basis of photographs taken before the cremation) was recovered from under a bridge at a place near Haridwar.	Reasoning
The accused appellants were apprehended along with vehicle at Purnia in Bihar on 29.08.2000.	Reasoning
They had failed to give any explanation for their presence in Purnia and also as to what had happened to Krishan Kumar who was driving the vehicle hired by them on 26.8.2000 to go to Haridwar.	Reasoning
In view of the very close proximity of the time between the accused and the deceased being seen together (4.30 P.M. of 26.8.2000) and the recovery of the dead body (10 A.M. of 27.8.2000) it was necessary for the accused to offer a reasonable explanation as to what had happened to the deceased Krishan Kumar with whom they had gone to Haridwar in the previous evening.	Reasoning
The accused could not have opted to remain silent.	Reasoning
They were duty bound to give adequate and reasonable explanation as regards the events that had taken place at Haridwar and the circumstances in which they had parted company with the deceased.	Reasoning
In their statement recorded under Section 313 CrPC the accused while admitting that they were arrested at Purnia in Bihar had given no explanation whatsoever as to what had happened at Haridwar and to Krishan Kumar and under what circumstances they had gone to Bihar without him.12.	Reasoning
Applying the law consistently laid down by this Court including the principles noticed in Vadlakonda Lenin (supra) to the facts of the present case, we are left with no doubt whatsoever that the circumstances proved by the prosecution, in the absence of any reasonable explanation on the part of the accused, cannot give rise to any other conclusion except that it is the accused alone who had abducted deceased Krishan Kumar and had killed him at Haridwar.	Reasoning
We, therefore, have to conclude that the conviction of the accused appellants do not call for any interference.	Decision
Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court, as upheld by the High Court.	Decision
Both the appeals consequently are dismissed.	Decision
