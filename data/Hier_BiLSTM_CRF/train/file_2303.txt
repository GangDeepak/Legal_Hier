On 30.3.1996 a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India has been filed in this Court laying challenge to the constitutional validity of the very same amendments which were unsuccessfully impugned in the Goodrickes case.18.	Facts
The writ petitions in the Tea Matters have in their petition stated a few grounds in support of the relief sought for.	Facts
However, a perusal of the grounds reveals that in substance the challenges is only one, i.e. the decision in Goodricke runs counter to the view of the law taken by SevenJudges Bench in India Cement and threeJudges Bench in Orissa Cement Goodricke was rightly not followed in Mahanadi Coal Fields rather Mahanadi Coal Fields has whittled down the authority of Goodricke and that being the position of law the impugned cess is ultra vires the power of the State Legislature and deserves to be pronounced so.	Facts
In short, the same challenge as was laid and turned down in Goodricke, is reiterated drawing support from the decisions of this Court previous and subsequent to Goodricke, and seeks the overruing of Goodricke.(C) BrickEarth Matters19.	Facts
The Bengal Brickfield Owners Association, being a representative body of the persons engaged in the activity of brick manufacturing and owning brickfields as also one of the brickfield owners, have joined in filing a writ petition before this Court wherein the constitutional validity of the very same provisions as contained in the Cess Act, 1880, the West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973 and the West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act, 1976 (both as amended by the Bengal Taxation Laws Amendment Act, 1992) has been put in issue, as has been subjected to challenge by the coal mine owners and the tea estate owners disputing the levy of cess allegedly on coal and tea.	Facts
The grounds of challenge, briefly stated, are three on number firstly, that brickearth is a minor mineral to which the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act, 1957, applies and by virtue of the declaration made by Section 2 of the Act by reference to Entry 54 in Schedule I of the Constitution, the field relating to such minor minerals is entirely covered by the Central Legislation and hence the State Legislations are not competent to levy the impugned cess secondly, that the levy is on the dispatch of minor minerals for sale while the process of manufacturing bricks does not involve any dispatch of the brickearth inasmcuh as the brickearth is consumed then and there, on the brickfield itself, in the process of manufacturing of bricks, and there being no dispatch or brickearth, the cess is not leviable and thirdly, that the State Government is not empowered to levy any cess on either the extraction of brickearth or on the dispatch of brickearth.	Facts
In support of these three grounds, it is further submitted that the same quantity of brickearth is subjected by Central Legislation to payment of royalty which is a tax, and the same quantity of brickearth is sought to be levied with cess which is incompetent so far as the State Government is concerned.	Facts
The writ petition places reliance on the decisions of this Court in India Cement Ltd. and others (supra), Orissa Cement Ltd. (supra) and Buxa Dooars Tea Company Ltd. and other (supra).	Facts
Some of the members of the petitioner association were served with demand notices.	Facts
The relief sought for in the petition is striking down of the relevant provisions of the three State Legislations as ultra vires the Constitution and quashing of the demand notices.	Facts
The reason for filing the petition in this Court, as stated in the writ petition, is that the provisions sought to be impugned herein have already been declared ultra vires by the High Court of Calcutta in relation to tea, an appeal against which decision has been filed in this Court and by an interim order the operation of the Judgment of the High Court was stayed.20.	Facts
According to the respondents, the cess sought to be levied by the impugned State Legislation is in the nature of fee and not tax.	Facts
The purpose of levying fee, as stated in the Preamble to the relevant legislation, is rendering different services to the society and for public benefit.	Facts
The cesses have been levied by the State Government for securing of welfare to the people by the State as is enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution of India by providing communication facilities, removal of illiteracy and rural employment to the poor living below the poverty line.	Facts
The impugned legislations levying the cess, do not encroach upon the field covered by the Central legislation.	Facts
The brickklin owners extract the brickearth as an item of trade.	Facts
From every 100 cft of brickearth which weighs 5 metric tones, 1382 bricks are manufactured.	Facts
The dispatch of 1382 bricks means the dispatch of 100 cft or 5 metric tones of brickearth.	Facts
A brickfield owner performs dual functions firstly, he extracts a quantum of brickearth from the quarry, and secondly, he dispatches the same for manufacture of bricks in the same quarryfield.	Facts
The brickfield owner is an extractor of brickearth and also a manufacturer of bricks.	Facts
The element of dispatch is kept hidden.	Facts
That is why the cess is now assessed on annual dispatches.	Facts
Dispatch, in the context of brickearth, means a removal of brickearth from one place to another which may be within the same complex and for domestic or captive use or consumption.	Facts
In any case, the removal of brickearth involved in the process cannot escape assessment.	None
Minor Mineral Matters This batch of appeals puts in issue the judgment dated 1.3.2000 delivered by a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court (reported as Ram Dhani Singh vs. Collector, Sonbhadra and others (AIR 2001 Allahabad 5), upholding the constitutional validity of a cess on mineral rights levied under Section 35 of the U.P. Special Area Development Authorities Act, 1986, read with Rule 3 of the Shakti Nagar Special Area Development Authority (Cess on Mineral Rights) Rules, 1997 (herein referred to briefly as SADA Act and SADA Cess Rules respectively).	Facts
There was a bunch of 73 writ petitions filed in the High Court which have all been dismissed.	Facts
The challenge is being pursued in this Court by ten writ petitioners through these appeals by special leave.22.	Facts
The Governor of Uttar Pradesh promulgated U.P. Ordinance No. 15 of 1985, which was repealed by U.P. Special Area Development Authorities Act, 1986 (U.P. Act No. 9 of 1986), containing identical provisions as were contained in the preceding Ordinance.	Facts
The said Act received the assent of the President of India on 19.3.1986 and was published in U.P. Gazette of that day.	Facts
Section 35 of the Act provides as under35.	Facts
Cess on mineral rights (1) Subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development, the Authority may impose a cess on mineral rights at such rate as may be prescribed.(2) Any Cess imposed under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the State Government and shall be leviable with effect from such date as may be appointed by the State Government in this behalf.23.	Facts
On 24.2.1997, in exercise of the power conferred by Section 35 of the Act, the Governor made the Shakti Nagar Special Area Development Authority (Cess on Mineral Rights) Rules, 1997, which were published on the same day in the U.P. Gazette and came into force.	Facts

In exercise of the power conferred by the Act and the Rules, the State Government proceeded to levy cess and take steps for recovery thereof by serving notices and issuing citations on the several stone crushers (which the appellants are), who extract stone as mineral and convert the same into metal by a process of crushing.	Facts
They filed the writ petitions disputing the levy and the demand by the State Government.24.	Facts
On behalf of the writpetitions, the SADA Cess Rules as also the legislative competence of the State Legislature to enact Section 35 of the SADA Act were challenged on the ground that the MMDR Act, having been enacted containing a declaration under Section 2 as contemplated by Entry 54 of ListI and the Act being applicable to Sonbhadra falling within the State of U.P. as well, the State Legislature was denuded of its power to enact the impugned law and levy the impugned cess.	Facts
It was also submitted that the impugned cess would have the effect of adding to the royalty already being paid and thereby increasing the same, which was ultra vires the power of the State Government as that power was exercisable only by the Central Government.25.	Facts
The High Court has held the SADA Act, the SADA Cess Rules and the levy of cess thereunder within the competence of State Legislature by reference of Entry 5 in List II.Reference to Constitution Bench26.	Facts
Since the appeals referable to coal matters and the writ petition referable to tea matters raised common issues, the cases were taken up for hearing together.	Facts
On 12.10.1999, the conflict amongst several decisions of this Court was brought to the notice of the threeJudges Bench hearing the matter which passed the following orderGreat emphasis has been placed by learned counsel for the State of West Bengal upon the judgment of a Bench of Three learned Judges in Goodricke Group Ltd. and others vs. State of West Bengal and others (1995 Suppl.	Facts

Quite apart from the fact that there are pending proceedings in this Court seeking to reconcile the judgment in Goodricke with that in a State of Orissa and others vs. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. and others (1995 Supp.	Facts
(2) SCC 686) , we find some difficulty in accepting as correct the view taken by Goodricke, particularly having regard to the earlier decision (of a Bench of two learned Judges) in Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. vs. State of West Bengal (1989) 3 SCC 211 ).	Facts
We think, therefore, that these matters should be heard by a Constitution bench.	Facts

Relevant Entries and principles of interpretation Before we proceed to examine the merits of the submissions and counter submissions made on behalf the parties, it will be useful to recapitulate and summarize a few principles relevant for interpreting entries classified and grouped into the three Lists of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.	None
The law is legion on the point and the principles which are being briefly stated hereinafter are more than settled.	None
These principles are referred to in the several decisions which we shall be referring to hereinafter.	None
So far as the principles are concerned, they have been followed invariably in all the decisions, however, diverse results have followed based on facts of individual cases and manner of application of such principles to the facts of those cases.	None
The relevant entries to which reference would be required to be made during the course of this judgment are extracted and reproduced herein SEVENTH SCHEDULE (Article 246)	None
List I Union List Industries, the control of which by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.	None
Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.	None
Fees is respect of any of the matters in this List, but not including fees taken in any court.	None
Any other matter not enumerated in List II or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those lists.	None

Taxes on lands and buildings.	None
Taxes on lands and buildings.	None
Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development.	None
Fees in respect of any of the matter in this List, but not including fees taken in any court.	None
Article 245 of the Constitution is the fountain source of legislative power.	Reasoning
It provides  subject to the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India, and the Legislature of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State.	Reasoning
The legislative field between the Parliament and the Legislature of any State is divided by Article 246 of the Constitution.	Reasoning
Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in Seventh Schedule, called the Union List.	Reasoning
Subject to the said power of the Parliament, the Legislature of any State has power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III, called the Concurrent List.	Reasoning
Subject to the above said two, the Legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II, called the State List.	None
Under Article 248 the exclusive power to Parliament to make laws extends to any matter not enumerated in the Government List or State List.	Reasoning
The power to making any law imposing of tax not mentioned in the Concurrent List or State List vests in Parliament.	Reasoning
This is what is called the residuary power vesting in Parliament.	Reasoning
The principles have been succinctly summarized and restated by a Bench of three learned Judges of this Court on a review of the available decisions in M s. Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and others vs. State of Bihar and others  (1983) 4 SCC 45.	Reasoning
They are (1) the various entries in the three Lists are not powers of legislation but fields of legislation.	Reasoning
The Constitution effects a complete separation of the taxing power of the Union and of the States under Article 246.	Reasoning
There is no overlapping anywhere in the taxing power and the Constitution gives independent sources of taxation to the Union and the States.(2)	Reasoning
In spite of the fields of legislation having been demarcated, the question of repugnancy between law made by Parliament and a law made by the State Legislature may arise only in cases when both the legislations occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and a direct conflict is seen.	Reasoning
If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the one hand and List I and List III on the other, the State law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the Union law.(3) Taxation is considered to be a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence.	Reasoning
There is a distinction made between general subjects of legislation and taxation.	Reasoning
The general subjects of legislation are dealt with in one group of entries and power of taxation in a separate group.	Reasoning
The power to tax cannot be deduced from a general legislative entry as an ancillary power.(4)	Reasoning
The entries in the List being merely topics of fields of legislation, they must receive a liberal construction inspired by a board and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense.	Reasoning
The words and expressions employed in drafting the entries must be given the widest possible interpretation.	Reasoning
This is because, to quote V. Ramaswami, J., the allocation of the subjects to the lists is not by way of scientific or logical definition but by way of a mere simplex enumeration of broad categories.	Reasoning
A power to legislate as to the principle matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its expense the legislations touching incidental and ancillary matters.(5) Where the legislative competence of a Legislature of any State is questioned on the ground that it encroaches upon the legislative competence of Parliament to enact a law, the question one has to ask is whether the legislation relates to any of the entries in Lists I or III.	Reasoning
If it does, no further question need be asked the Parliaments legislative competence must be upheld.	None
Where there are three Lists containing a large number of entries, there is bound to be some overlapping among them.	Reasoning
In such a situation the doctrine of pith and substance has to be applied to determine as to which entry does a given piece of legislation relate.	Reasoning
Once it is so determined, any incidental trenching on the field reserved to the other Legislature is of no consequence.	Reasoning
The Court has to look at the substance of the matter.	Reasoning
The doctrine of pith and substance is sometimes expressed in terms of ascertaining the true character of legislation.	Reasoning
The name given by the Legislature to the legislation is immaterial.	Reasoning
Regard must be had to the enactment as a whole, to its main objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions.	Reasoning
Incidental and superficial encroachments are to be disregarded.(6)	Reasoning
The doctrine of occupied field applies only when there is a clash between the Union and the State Lists within an area common to both.	Reasoning
There the doctrine of pith and substance is to be applied and if the impugned legislation substantially falls within the power expressly conferred upon the Legislature which enacted it, an incidental encroaching in the field assigned to another Legislature is to be ignored.	Reasoning
While reading the three Lists, List I has priority over lists III and II, and List III has priority over List II.	Reasoning
However, still, the predominance of the Union List would not prevent the State Legislature from dealing with any matter within List II though it may incidentally affect any item in List I. (emphasis supplied)	None
Tax Legislation	None
The above stated are general principles.	None
Legislations in the field of taxation and economic activities need special consideration and are to be viewed with larger flexibility in approach.	None
Observations of the Constitution Bench in R.K. Garg vs. Union of India and others, (1981) 4 SCC 676, are apposite, wherein this Court has emphasized a greater latitude  like play in the joints  being allowed to the Legislature because it has to be deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straitjacket formula.	None
In this field the Court should feel more inclined to give judicial defence to legislative judgment.	None
Their Lordships quoted with approval the following statement of Frankfurter, J. in Morey vs. Daud, (1957) 354 US 457 In the utilities, tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial selfrestraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment.	None
The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility.	None
The Courts have only the power to destroy not to reconstruct.	None
When these are added to the complexity or economic regulation, the uncertainty, the liability to error the bewildering conflict of the experts, and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events, selflimitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability.	None
Their Lordships further observed that the Courts ought to adopt a pragmatic approach in solving problems rather than measuring the propositions by abstract symmetry.	None
The exact wisdom and nice adaptations of remedies may not be possible.	None
Even crudities and inequities have to be accommodated in complicated tax and economic legislations.	None
We now proceed to enter a deeper dimension in the field of tax legislation by considering the problem of devising the measure of taxation.	None
This aspect has been dealt with in dealt in Union of India and others vs. Bombay Tyre International Ltd., (1983) 4 SCC 210.	Reasoning
Tracing the principles from the leading authority of Re. a reference under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and Section 3 of the Finance Act (Northern Ireland) 1934, (1936)	Reasoning
A.C. 352, passing through Relia Ram vs. Province of East Punjab, 1948 FCR 207, and treading through the law as it has developed through judicial pronouncements one after the other, this Court has made subtle observations therein.	Reasoning
It has been long recognized that the measure employed for assessing a tax must not be confused with the nature of the tax.	Reasoning
A tax has two elements first, the person, thing or activity on which the tax is imposed, and secondly, the amount of tax.	Reasoning
The amount may be measured in many ways but a distinction between the subject matter of a tax and the standard by which the amount of tax is measured must not be lost sight of.	Reasoning
These are described respectively as the subject of a tax and the measure of a tax.	Reasoning
It is true that the standard adopted as a measure of the levy may be indicative of the nature of the tax, but it does not necessary determine it.	Reasoning
The nature of the mechanism by which the tax is to be assessed is not decisive of the essential characteristic of the particular tax charged, thought it may throw light on the general character of the tax.	Reasoning
Here we may refer to certain illustrative cases of well settled authority  the authority which has not been shaken so far and has rather withstood the test of times.	None
Taxation  Measure of levy not suggestive of nature of tax  illustrative cases  In Ralla Ram (supra) the Federal Court held that a tax on buildings under Section 3 of the Punjab Urban Immovable Property Tax Act, 1940, measured by a percentage of the annual value of such building, remained a tax on buildings even though the measure of annual value of a building was also adopted as a standard for determining income from property under the Income Tax Act.	None
The same standard was adopted as a measure for the two levies, yet the levies remained separate imposts by virtue of their distinctive nature.	None
The measure adopted, it was held, could not be identified with the nature of the tax levied.	None
In M s. Sainik Motors, Jodhpur vs. State of Rajasthan (1962) 1	None
SCR 517 , a tax on passengers and goods was assessed as a rate on the fares and freights payable by the owners of the motor vehicles.	None
The contention that the levy was a tax upon income and not upon passengers and goods was repelled by this Court.	None
The Court pointed out that though the measure of the tax is furnished by the fares and freights it does not cease to be a tax on passengers and goods.	None
In D.G. Gouse Co., State of Kerala, (1980) 2 SCC 410 , the Court examined the different modes available to the Legislature for measuring the levy of tax on buildings.	None
The Court upheld the provision made by the Legislature linking the levy with the annual value of the building and prescribing a uniformed formula for determining its capital value and for calculating the tax.	None
In The HingirRampur Coal Co. Ltd. vs. State of Orissa, 1961) 2	Reasoning
SCR 537 , the form in which the levy was imposed was held to be an impermissible test for defining in itself the character of the levy.	None
It was argued that the method of determining the rate of levy was by reference to the minerals produced by the mines and, therefore, it was levy in the nature of a duty of excise.	None
This Court held that the method thus adopted may be relevant in considering the character of the impost but its effect must be weighed along with and in the light of the other relevant circumstances.	None
Referring to Bombay Tyre International Ltd. (supra), the Court further held that it is clear that when enacting a measure to serve as a standard for assessing the levy, the Legislature need not contour it along lines which spell out the character of the levy itself.	None
A broader based standard of reference is permissible to be adopted for the purpose of determining the measure of the levy.	None
Any standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy.	None
Meaning of Lands  as used in Entry 49 in List II	None
The word land  as used in Entry 49 in List II, came up for the consideration of this Court in Anant Mills vs. State of Gujarat, (1995) 2 SCC 175.	None
It was held that the word land cannot be assigned a narrow meaning so as to confine it to the surface of the earth.	None
It includes all strata above or below.	None
In other words, the word land includes not only the surface of the earth but everything under or over it, and has in its legal significance an indefinite extent upward and downward.	None
The fourJudges Bench upheld the validity of the law levying tax in respect of area occupied by underground lines by reference to Entry 49 in List II, holding it to be a tax on land only.	None
Ample authority is available for the concept that under Entry 49 in List II the land remains a land without regard to the use to which it is being subjected.	None
It is open for the Legislature to ignore the nature of the user and tax the land.	None
At the same time it is also permissible to identify, for the purpose of classification, the land by reference to its user.	None
While taxing the land it is open for the Legislature to consider the land which produces a particular growth or is useful for a particular utility and to classify it separately and tax the same.	Reasoning
Different pieces of land identically situated otherwise, but being subjected to different uses, or having different potential, are capable of being classified separately without incurring the wrath of Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
The Constitution Bench in Kunnathat Thathunnai Moonil Nair etc. vs. State of Kerala and Another (1961) 3	None
SCR 77 , held that the land on which a forest stands is not to be excluded necessarily from Entry 409.	None
The erstwhile Entry 19 of Schedule II applied to forest.	None
Their Lordships held that the use of the word forest in Entry 19 could not be pressed into service to cut down the plain meaning of the word land in Entry 49.	None
It was permissible to tax the land on which a forest stands by reference to Entry 40.	None
In Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee vs. Local Board of Barpeta (1965) 3 SCR 47 , the appellant, a land holder, held a hatt (or market) on his land.	None
The Local Board asked the appellant to take out a licence and pay Rs. 600/, later Rs. 700/ by way of licence fee for holding the market.	None
It was urged that the impost was unconstitutional, inter alia, on the ground that the tax was actually imposed on the market, which infringed Article 14 of the Constitution and also because the State Legislature had no legislative competence to tax a market.	None
The Local Board relied on Entry 49 in List II.	None
The appellant urged that Entries 45 to 63 which deal with taxes do not contemplate a tax on markets.	None
Repelling the plea, the Constitution Bench held that the tax was on the land though the charges arise only when the land is used for a market.	None
The tax remained a tax on land in spite of the imposition being dependant upon the user of the land as a market.	None
The tax was an annual tax as contrasted to a tax for each day on which the market was held.	None
The owner or occupier of the land was responsible for payment of tax on a annual basis.	None
The amount of tax depended upon the area of the land on which the market was held and the importance of the market.	None
Thus, the tax was held to be a tax on land, though the incidence depended upon the use of the land as a market.	None
In Vivian Joseph Ferreira and Anr.	None
vs. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay and others (1972) 1 SCC 70 , the tax was confined to the residential tenanted buildings.	None
The classification was held to be valid.	None
In the Government of Andhra Pradesh and another vs. Hindustan Machine Tools Ltd. (1975) 2 SCC 274 houses tax was levied on the buildings.	None
The new definition of house included a factory.	None
However, the house tax was levied only on the building occupied by the factory and not on the machinery and furniture.	None
The State Legislature claimed competence to do so under Entry 49, List II.	None
The power to tax a building, exercisable without reference to the use to which the building is put, was held to be valid.	None
In the opinion of the Court, it was irrelevant that the building was occupied by a factory which could not conduct its activities without the machinery and furniture.	None
Once it is held that the land or building is available to be taxed, it does not matter to what use the land is being subjected though the nature of the user may enable land of one particular user being classified separately from the land being subjected to another kind of user.	None
The tax would remain a tax on land.	None
It cannot be urged that what is being taxed is not the land but the nature of its user.	None
So also it is permissible to adopt myriad forms and methods of valuation for the purpose of quantifying the tax.	None
In Ralla Ram vs. The Province of East Punjabu  1948 FCR 207, the Federal Court made it clear that every effort should be made as far as possible to reconcile the seeming conflict between the provisions of the Provincial Legislation and the Federal Legislation.	None
Unless the court forms an opinion that the extent of the alleged invasion by a Provincial Legislature into the field of the Federal Legislature is so great as would justify the view that in pith and substance of the impugned tax is a tax within the domain of the Federal Legislature, the levy of tax would not be liable to be struck down.	None
The test laid down in Sir Byramjee Jeejeebhoys case (AIR 1940 Bom 65 ) by the Full Bench of Bombay High Court was approved.	None
In Assistant Commissioner of Urban Land Tax Madras and others etc. vs. Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. etc.  (1969) 2 SCC 55 , for the purpose of attracting the applicability of Entry 49 in List II, so as to cover the impugned levy of tax on lands and buildings, the Constitution Bench laid down twin tests, namely, (i) that such tax is directly imposed on lands and buildings, and (ii) that it bears a definite relation to it.	None
Once these tests were satisfied, it was open for the State Legislature, for the purpose of levying tax, to adopt the annual value or the capital value of the lands and buildings for determining the incidence of tax.	None
Merely, on account of such methodology having been adopted, the State Legislature cannot be accused of having encroached upon Entries 86, 87 or 88 of List I. Entry 86 in List I proceeds on the Principle of Aggregation and tax is imposed on the totality of the value of all the assets.	None
It is quite permissible to separate lands and buildings for the purpose of taxation under Entry 49 in List II.	None
There is no reason for restricting the amplitude of the language used in the Entry 49 in List II.	None
The levy of tax, calculated at the rate of a certain per centum of the market value of the urban land was held to be intra vires the powers of the State Legislature and not trenching upon Entry 86 in List I.	None
So is the view taken by another Constitution Bench of Shri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. , etc. vs. Breach Borough Municipality and others, (1969) 2 SCC 283 , where the submission that the levy was not a rate on lands and buildings as appropriately understood, but rather a tax on capital value was discarded.	None
M s. R.R. Engineering Co. etc.	None
Zila Parishad, Bareilly and Anr.	None
etc.  (1980) 3 SCC 330 , is a case of circumstances and properties tax levied on the basis of income which the assessee receives from his profession, trade, calling or property.	None
The plea that the tax was a tax on income was discarded.	None
The test propounded by the Constitution Bench is that an excessive levy on circumstance may tend to blur the distinction between a tax on income and a tax on circumstances.	None
Income will then cease to be a measure or yardstick of the tax and will become the very subjectmatter of the tax.	None
Restraint in this behalf is a prudent prescription for the local authorities to follow.	None
The Constitution Bench observed that it was only a matter of convenience that income was adopted as a yardstick or measure for assessing the tax and the evolvement of such mechanism was not conclusive on the nature of tax.	None
We are inclined to make a reference to a few selected Full Bench decisions of different High Courts which have been cited with approval before this Court in many of the decisions to which we are making reference during the course of this judgment.	None
In Sir Byramjee Jeejeebhoy vs. Province of Bombay and Ors.  A.I.R. 1940 Bombay 65 (F.B.) the Provincial Government levied a tax at the rate of 5 of the annual letting value of the City of Bombay on the buildings and lands.	None
The buildings were classified by reference to their annual letting value, and exception from payment of tax was also carved out in favour of such buildings as remained vacant and unproductive of rent for the specified period.	None
It was urged that the impugned tax purported or desired to tax the value.	None
Placing reliance on the Federal Courts decision in In Re C.P. Motor Spirit Act, 1939 (1939 FCR 18) Chief Justice Beaumont held that the impugned tax was a tax on lands and buildings.	None
Three submissions were made in support of the challenge (i) that the tax is graded by reference to the annual value of the property charged, (ii) that an allowance was available to be made in respect of vacant properties, and (iii) that the basis of the tax was the same as the basis on which tax on income from property was imposed by Sections 6 and 9 of Income Tax Act and, therefore in reality the rate was a tax on income.	None
Beaumont, C.J. held that regard must be had to the pith and substance of the impugned tax and not merely to the form.	None
All the items in the Provincial List must be so construed as to exclude taxes on income.	None
The tax is charged on lands and buildings and it is based on the estimated rent which the property would fetch.	None
Such a value may bear very little relation to the actual income of the property.	None
It is imposed without any relation to the capital value except insofar as such value can be ascertained by reference to the rateable value.	None
It did not make any difference if the arbitrary basis which was adopted for the purpose of the rate might as well be applied for ascertaining the capital value as for ascertaining income.	None
The fact that some concession is allowed to the small owner, a concession which may be based as much on political as on economic considerations and that an allowance may be made where the property is shown to produce no income, a fact which may be taken to show that the estimated value was found to be erroneous, cannot alter the nature of the tax.	None
The concept that in case of conflict between the Federal List and Provincial List, an entry in the Federal List may be given a more resticted meaning, was endorsed.	None
The legality of the levy was upheld.	None
In District Board of Farrukhabad vs. Prag Dutt and Ors.	None
AIR 1948 Allahabad 382 (F.B.), a tax on circumstances and property was under challenge.	None
It was urged that it was a tax on income.	None
Chief Justice Malik held that the fundamental difference between the tax on income and a tax on circumstances and property is that income tax can only be levied if there is income and if there is no income, no tax is payable.	None
But in the case of circumstances and property tax, where a mans status has to be determined, his total business turnover may be considered for purposes of taxation, though he may not have earned any taxable income.	None
The State of Punjab vs. The Union of India through the Secretary to Government Finance Department, Government of India, New Delhi  AIR 1971 Punjab Haryana 155 (F.B.), is a FiveJudges Bench decision delivered by Chief Justice Harbans Singh.	None
Conflict was noticed between List I, Entry 86 and List II, Entry 49.	None
Dealing with the scope of Entry 49 in List II, it was held that it empowers the State Legislatures to directly tax lands and buildings, and for determining the basis of the tax the State Legislature may take either the area, annual rental value, market value of the capital value of the land as a basis for calculating and quantifying the tax on land.	None
Merely because tax was calculated on the basis of annual rental value, it will not turn it into a tax on income, and if it is based on capital value, it will not turn it into a tax on capital value.	None
Yet another angle which the Constitutional Courts would advisedly do better to keep in view while dealing with a tax legislation, in the light of the purported conflict between the powers of the Union and the State to legislate, which was stated forcefully and which was logically based on an analytical examination of constitutional scheme by Jeevan Reddy, J. in S.R. Bomai and others vs. Union of India (1994) 3 SCC 1 , may be touched.	Reasoning
Our Constitution has a federal structure.	Reasoning
Several provisions of the Constitution unmistakably show that the Founding Fathers intended to create a strong centre.	Reasoning
The historical background relevant at the time of the framing of the Constitution warranted a strong centre naturally and necessarily.	Reasoning
This bias of the framers towards the centre is found reflect in the distribution of legislative heads between the Centre and the States.	Reasoning
More important heads of the legislation are placed in List I.	Reasoning
In the Concurrent List the parliamentary enactment is given primacy, irrespective of the fact whether such enactment is earlier or later in point of time to a State enactment on the same subject matter.	Reasoning
The residuary power to legislate is with the Centre.	Reasoning
By the Fortysecond Amendment a few of the entries in List II were omitted or transferred to other lists.	Reasoning
Articles 249 to 252 further demonstrate the primacy of Parliament, allowing it liberty to encroach on the field meant exclusively for the State legislation though subject to certain conditions being satisfied.	Reasoning
In the matter of finances, the States appear to have been placed in a less favourable position.	Reasoning
True, the Centre has been given more powers but the same is accompanied by certain additional responsibilities as well.	Reasoning
The Constitution is an organic living document.	Reasoning
Its outlook and expression as perceived and expressed by the interpreters of the Constitution must be dynamic and keep pace with the changing times.	Reasoning
Though the basics and fundamentals of the Constitution remain unalterable, the interpretation of the flexible provisions of the Constitution can be accompanied by dynamism and lean, in case of conflict, in favour of the weaker or the one who is more needy.	Reasoning
Several taxes are collected by the Centre and allocation of revenue is made to States from time to time.	Reasoning
The Centre consuming the lions share of revenue has attracted good amount of criticism at the hands of the States and financial experts.	Reasoning
The interpretation of Entries can afford to strike a balance, or at least try to remove imbalance, so far as it can.	Reasoning
Any conscious whittling down of the powers of the State can be guarded against by the Courts.	Reasoning
Let it be said that the federalism in the Indian Constitution is not a matter of administrative convenience, but one of principle  the outcome of our own historical process and a recognition of the ground realities.	Reasoning
Quoting from M.C. Setalvad, Tagore Law Lectures Union and State relations under the Indian Constitution (Eastern Law House, Calcutta, 1974), Jeevan Reddy, J. observed  It is enough to note that our Constitution has certainly a bias towards the Centre visavis the States	Reasoning
It is equally necessary to emphasise that Courts should be careful not to upset the delicately  crafted constitutional scheme by a process of interpretation.	None
The Conflict a cautious evaluation of India Cement We will now refer to and deal with those cases which have led to the three learned Judges of this Court, placing the matter for consideration by a Constitution Bench.	None
We would refer to the cases mentioned in the order of reference and also to those cases which were heavily relied upon on behalf of the respondents, disputing the validity of the impugned tax.	None
Immediately, we take up India Cement.	None
In India Cement Ltd. and others vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others (1990) 1 SCC 12 , what was impugned was a levy of cess on royalty and the question was, whether such cess on royalty is within the competence of the State Legislature.	None
The appellant was required to pay, by the Madras Panchayats Act, 1958, local cess at the rate of 45 paise per rupee of the royalty already being paid.	None
The question formulated by the Court, as arising for decision was is cess (on royalty a demand of land revenue or additional royalty?	None
The Court found that the royalty was payable by the appellant as prescribed under the lease deed.	None
The rates of the royalty were fixed under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which is a Central Act, passed under Entry 54 in List I, by which the control of mines and minerals has been taken over by the Central Government.	None
The State Legislature sought to justify and sustain the levy by reference to Entry 49, 50 or 45 in List II.	None
Cess is a tax and is generally used when the levy is for some special administrative expense, suggested by the name of the cess, such as health cess, education cess, road cess etc.	None
This is a wellsettled position of law.	None
The levy was sought to be justified under Entry 45 in List II by including it within the meaning of land revenue, and in the alternative under Entry 49 in List II as tax on lands.	None
The challenge to the constitutional validity of the levy was upheld.	None
We would briefly state the reasoning which prevailed with the learned Judges.	None
G.L. Oza, J. delivered concurring opinion.	None
The majority opinion expressed through Sabyasachi Mukharji, J., (as his Lordship then was), first clarified the distinction between royalty and land revenue, Land revenue is connotative of the share in the produce of land which the king or the Government is entitled to receive.	None
Royalty is a charge payable on the extraction of minerals from the land.	None
A cess on royalty cannot, therefore, be called additional land revenue and as such the State was disabled from imposing tax on royalty.	None
There is a clear distinction between tax directly on land and tax on income arising from land.	None
Royalty is indirectly connected with land and a cess on royalty cannot be called a tax directly on land as a unit.	None
The levy could also not be sustained under Entry 50 in List II which deals with taxes on mineral rights subject to limitation imposed by Parliament relating to mineral development.	None
Assuming that the tax in pith and substance fell to Entry 50 in List II, it would be controlled by a Legislation under Entry 54 in List I. A Division Bench decision of Mysore High Court in M s. Laxminarayana Mining Co., Bangalore and Anr.	None
vs. Taluk Development Board and Anr  AIR 1972	None
Mysore 299 was cited with approval in India Cement.	None
The Mysore High Court struck down as violative of MMDR Act, 1957 a licence fee on mining manganese or iron ore etc. imposed by a State Legislation.	None
A perusal of judgment of the Mysore High Court shows that the impost was by way of licence fee on the mining of certain minerals.	None
Regulation and development of mines and minerals was undertaken by the Central Legislation and therefore the power of the State Legislature under Entries 23 and 52 in List II got denuded in the field of regulation and development covered by the Central Legislation.	None
The Division Bench vide para 6 held it is therefore clear that to the extent the Central Act makes provision regarding the regulation and development of minerals, the powers of the State Legislatures under Entry 23 of List II stand curtailed The State Government had sought to defend the licence fee on the ground that it was in the nature of a tax and not a licence fee.	None
This plea has been specifically noted by the High Court and dealt with.	None
However, what is significant to note is the revelation, made by careful reading of the judgment, that provision for licence fee was made in the Central Legislation and licence fee was sought to be imposed by the State too.	None
In fact, the licence fee was a step trenching upon the field of regulation and therefore was liable to be struck down on this ground alone.	None
Yet, another reasoning which prevailed with the High Court was that Section 143 of the State Act, which was not inconsistent with the Central Act, was relied on by the State Government as conferring power on it to levy the impugned licence fee.	None
On that plea the High Court formed an opinion that on the framing of Section 143 of the State Act it did not express terms authorize a levy of fee or tax.	None
The High Court observed  It (Section 143) cannot also be construed as conferring such a power on the respondents to levy a tax or fee on mining, in view of the wellsettled and statutory construction that a Court construing a provision of law must presume that the intention of the authority in making it was not to exceed its power but to enact it validity.	None
The ratio of the decision of the Mysore High Court is that provision for licences and license fees, operation in the field or regulation of mines and minerals is not available to be made by State legislation  in view of the declaration in terms of Entry 54 in List I.	None
In our view, the decision by Mysore High Court cannot be read so widely as laying down the law that Unions power to regulate and control results in depriving the States of their power to levy tax or fee within their legislative competence without trenching upon the field of regulation and control.	None
There is a distinction between power to regulate and control and power to tax, the two being distinct and that difference has not been kept in view by the Mysore High Court.	None
(A diversion from main issue)	None
Royalty, if tax?	None
We would like to avail this opportunity for pointing out an error, attributable either to a stenographers devil or to sheer inadvertence, having crept into the majority judgment in India Cement Ltd.s case (supra).	None
The error in apparent and only needs a careful reading to detect.	None
We feel constrained  rather duty bound  to say so, lest a reading of the judgment containing such an error  just an error of one word  should continue to cause the likely embarrassment and have adverse effect on the subsequent judicial pronouncements which would follow India Cement Ltd.s case, feeling bound and rightly, by the said judgment having the force of pronouncement by sevenJudges Bench.	None
Para 34 of the report reads as under In the aforesaid view of the matter, we are of the opinion that royalty is a tax, and as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty, is beyond the competence of the State legislature because Section 9 of the Central Act covers the field and the State legislature is denuded of its competence under Entry 23 of List II.	None
In any event, we are of the opinion that cess on royalty cannot be sustained under Entry 49 of List II as being a tax on land.	None
Royalty on minerals rights is not a tax on land but a payment for the user of land.	None
(underlining by us)	None
In the first sentence the word royalty occurring in the expression  royalty is a tax, is clearly an error.	None
What the majority wished to say, and has in fact said, is  cess on royalty is a tax.	None
The correct words to be printed in the judgment should have been cess on royalty in place of royalty only.	None
The words cess on appear to have been inadvertently or erroneously omitted while typing the text of judgment.	None
This is clear from reading the judgment in its entirety.	None
Vide para 22 and 31, which precede para 34 above said, their Lordships have held that royalty is not a tax.	None
Even the last line of para 34 records royalty on mineral rights is not a tax on land but a payment for the user of land.	None
The very first sentence of the para records in quick succession as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty, is beyond the competence of the State Legislature What their Lordships have intended to record is that cess on royalty is a tax and as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty is beyond the competence of the State Legislature That makes correct and sensible reading.	None
A doubtful expression occurring in a judgment, apparently by mistake for inadvertence, ought to be read by assuming that the Court had intended to say only that which is correct according to the settled position of law, and the apparent error should be ignored, far from making any capital out of it, giving way to the correct expression which ought to be implied or necessarily read in the context, also having regard to what has been said a little before and a little after.	None
No learned Judge would consciously author a judgment which is selfinconsistent or incorporates passages repugnant to each other.	None
Vide para 22, their Lordships have clearly held that there is no entry in Schedule II which enables the State to impose a tax on royalty and, therefore, the State was incompetent to impose such a tax (cess).	None
The cess which has an incidence of an additional charge on royalty and not a tax on land, cannot apparently be justified as failing under Entry 49 in List II.	None
It is of significance for the issue before us, to determine the nature of royalty and whether it is a tax, and if not, then what it is.	None
Until the pronouncement of this Court in India Cement (supra), it has been the uniform and unanimous judicial opinion that royalty is not a tax.	None
First will refer to certain dictionaries oftcited in courts of law.	None

Words and Phrases, Legally Defined (Third Edition, 1990, Vol. 4, page 112)  	None
A royalty, in the sense in which the word is used in connection with mining leases, is a payment to the lessor proportionate to the amount of the demised mineral worked within a specified period.	None
Whartons Law Lexicon (Fourteenth Edition, page 893)  Royalty, payment to a patentee by agreement on every article made according to his patent or to an another by a publisher on every copy of his book sold or to the owner of minerals for the right of working the same on every ton or other weight raised.	None
Mozley Whiteleys Law Dictionary (Eleventh Edition, 1993, page 243)  A pro rata payment to a grantor or lessor, on the working of the property leased, or otherwise on the profits of the grant of lease.	None
The word is especially used in reference to mines, patents and copyrights.	None
Prems Judicial Dictionary (1992, Vol. 2, page 1458)  royalties are payments which the Government may demand for the approprition of minerals, timber or other property belonging to the Government.	None
Two important features of royalty have to be noticed, they are, that the payment made for the privilege of removing the articles is in proportion to the quantity removed, and the basis of the payment is an agreement.	None
Blacks Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition, p.1330)  Royalty  A share of the product or profit from real property, reserved by the grantor of a mineral lease, in exchange for the lessees right to mine or drill on the land.	None
Mineral Royalty A right to a share of income from mineral production.	None
In D.K. Trivedi Sons and others vs. State of Gujarat others 1986 (Supp) SCC 20, a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court dealt with rent, royalty and dead rent and held as follows.	None
Rent is an integral part of the concept of a lease.	None
It is the consideration from the lessee to the lessor for the demise of the property to him.	None
In a mining lease the consideration usually moving from the lessee to the lessor is the rent of the areas leased (often called surface rent), dead rent and royalty.	None
Since the mining lease confers upon the lessee the right not merely to enjoy the property as under an ordinary lease but also to extract minerals from the land and to appropriate them for his own use or benefit, in addition to the usual rent for the area demised, the lessee is required to pay a certain amount in respect of the minerals extracted proportionate to the quantity so extracted.	None
Such payment is called royalty.	None
It may, however, be that the mine is not worked properly so as not to yield enough return to the lessor in the shape of royalty.	None
In order to ensure for the lessor a regular income, regardless of whether the mine is worked or not, a fixed amount is provided to be paid to him by the lessee.	None
This is called dead rent.	None
Dead rent is calculated on the basis of the area leased while royalty is calculated on the quantity of minerals extracted or removed.	None
Thus, while dead rent is a fixed return to the lessor, royalty is a return which varies with the quantity of minerals extracted or removed.	None
Since dead rent and royalty are both a return to the lessor in respect of the area leased, looked at from one point of view dead rent can be described as the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty payable to the lessor but calculated on the basis of the area leased, and not on the quantity of minerals extracted or removed.	None
In H.R.S. Murthy vs. Collector of Chittor, (1964) 6	None
SCR 666 , too the Constitution Bench of this Court had defined Royalty to mean the payment made for the materials or minerals won from the land.	None
The judicial opinion as prevailing amongst the High Courts may be noticed.	None
A Full Bench of the High Court of Orissa held in Laxmi Narayan Agarwalla and others vs. State of Orissa and others, AIR 1983 Orissa 210, Royalty is the payment made for the minerals extracted it is not tax.	None
In Surajdin Laxmanlal vs. State of M.P., Nagpur and others  AIR 1960 M.P. 129, a Division Bench of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh referred to the Whartons Law Lexicon and Mozley Whiteleys Law Dictionary and said  royalties are payments which the Government may demand for the appropriation of minerals, timber or other property belonging to the Government.	None
The High Court opined that there are two important features of royalty (i) the payment is in proportion to the quantity removed and (ii) the basis of payment is an agreement.	None
Drawing a distinction between royalty and tax, a Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana High Court held in Dr. Shanti Saroop Sharma vs. Anr.	None
vs. State of Punjab and others (AIR 1969 Punjab and Haryana 79 as under if a person is merely in occupation of land which contains minor minerals, he is not liable to pay any royalty, but it is only when he holds a mining lease and by virtue of that extracts one or more minor minerals that he is called upon to pay royalty to the Government where the lease is in respect of the land in which minor minerals vest in the Government.	None
Royalty thus has its basis in the contract.	None
For payment to the owner of the minerals for the privilege of extracting the minor minerals computed on the basis of the quantity actually extracted and removed from the leased area.	None
It is more akin to rent or compensation payable to an owner by the occupier or lessee of land for its use or exploitation of the resources contained therein.	None
Merely because the provision with regard to royalty is made by virtue of the rules relating to the regulation of the mining leases and a uniform rate is prescribed, it does not follow that it is a compulsory exaction in the nature of tax or impost.	None
A Division Bench of Gujarat High Court in Saurashtra Cement and Chemical Industries Ltd., Ranavav vs. Union of India and Anr.  	None
AIR 1979 Gujarat 180, emphatically said  royalty may not be a fee	None
but it is not a tax.	None
It is a payment for the mineral which is removed or consumed by the holder of the mining lease.	None
The minerals themselves,  the property beneath the soil belong to the Union.	None
When the holder of a mining lease removes these minerals or consumes them, he can do so only on payment of its price or value.	None
Therefore, royalty is a share which the Union claims in the minerals which have been won from the soil by the lessee and which otherwise belong to it.	None
Royalty is a share in such minerals and not a tax in the form of a compulsory exaction.	None
It is not compulsory because anyone who applies for a mining lease to win minerals for being removed or consumed must pay its price.	None
If he does not want to pay the price, he may not apply for a mining lease.	None
Royalty which is a share of the owner of the minerals  the Union  won by the lessee from the soil with the authority of the Union can never be said to be an imposition on the holder of a mining lease.	None
We need not further multiply the authorities.	None
Suffice it to say that until the pronouncement in India Cement, nobody doubted the correctness of royalty not being a tax.	None
Such has been the position even subsequent to the pronouncement in India Cement.	None
In Inderjeet Singh Sial and another vs. Karam Chand Thapar and others (1995) 6 SCC 166 , a Bench of two learned judges held that  In its primary and natural sense royalty, in the legal world, is known as the equivalent or translation of jura regalia or jura regia.	None
Royal rights and prerogatives of a sovereign are covered thereunder.	None
In its secondary sense the word royalty would signify, as in mining leases, that part of the reddendum, variable though, payable in cash or kind, for rights and privileges obtained.	None
It is found in the clause of the deed by which the grantor reserves something to himself out of that which he grants.	None
It may even be a clause reserving rent in a lease, whereby the lesser reserves something for himself out of that which he grants.	None
In Ajit Singh vs. Union of India and others (1995 Supp.	None
(4) SCC 224, another Bench of two learned Judges held that the grant of mining lease involves grant of a privilege by the State.	None
In both these decisions India Cements is not noticed.	None
In Quarry Owners Association vs. State of Bihar and others (2000) 8 SCC 655 , a Bench of two learned Judges was faced with a submission, based on India Cement and subsequent decisions following it, that royalty is a tax.	None
The learned Judges found it difficult to accept the concept but tried to wriggle out of the situation by observing  royalty includes the price for the consideration of parting with the right and privilege of the owner, namely, the State Government who owns the mineral.	None
In other words, the royalty dead rent, which a lessee or licensee pays, includes the price of the minerals which are the property of the State.	None
Both royalty and dead rent are integral parts of a lease.	None
Thus, it does not constitute usual tax as commonly understood but includes return for the consideration for parting with its property.	None
In India Cement (vide para 31, SCC) decisions of four High Courts holding Royalty is not tax have been noted without any adverse comment.	None
Rather, the view seems to have been noted with tacit approval.	None
Earlier (vide para 21, SCC) the connotative meaning of royalty being share in the produce of land has been noted.	None
But for the first sentence (in para 34, SCC) which we find to be an apparent error, no where else has the majority judgment held royalty to be a tax.	None
How the above noted inadvertent error in India Cement has resulted into throwing on the loop line the movement of later case law on this point may be noticed.	None
In State of M.P. vs. Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. and others  1995 Supp.	None
(1) SCC 642 (decision by a Bench of three learned Judges), and	None
Saurashtra Cement and Chemicals Industries and Anr. etc. etc. vs. Union of India and others (2001) 1 SCC 91 (decision by a Bench of two learned Judges) para 34 (from SCC) in India Cement has been quoted verbatim and dealt with.	Facts
In Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. and otherss case (supra), the court noticed several dictionaries defining royalty and also the decisions of High Courts available and stated that traditionally speaking royalty is an amount which is paid under contract of lease by the lessee to the lessor, namely, the State Governments concerned and it is commensurate with the quality of minerals extracted.	None
But then (vide para 12), the Court felt bound by the view taken in India Cement, reiterated in Orissa Cement, to hold that royalty is a tax.	None
The point that there was apparently a typographical error in para 34 in India Cement was specifically raised but was rejected.	None
In Saurashtra Cement and Chemicals Industries and anr.	None
(supra) too the Court felt itself bound by the decision in Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. and others (supra), backed by India Cement and therefore held royalty to be tax.	None
We have clearly pointed out the said error, as we are fully convinced in that regard and feel ourselves obliged constitutionally, legally and morally to do so, lest the said error should cause any further harm to the trend of jurisprudential thought centering around the meaning of royalty.	None
We hold that royalty is not tax.	Reasoning
Royalty is paid to the owner of land who may be a private person and may not necessarily be State.	Reasoning
A private person owning the land is entitled to charge royalty but not tax.	Reasoning
The lessor receives royalty as his income and for the lessee the royalty paid is an expenditure incurred.	Reasoning
Royalty cannot be tax.	Reasoning
We declare that even in India Cement it was not the finding of the Court that royalty is a tax.	Reasoning
A statement caused by an apparent typographical or inadvertent error in a judgment of the Court should not be misunderstood as declaration of such law by the Court.	Reasoning
We also record our express dissent with that part of the judgment in Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. and others which says (vide para 12 of SSC report) that there was no typographical error in India Cement and that the said conclusion that royalty is a tax logically flew from the earlier paragraphs of the judgment.	Reasoning
Interrelationship of Schedule I Entry 54 and Schedule II Entry 23 With the abovesaid reflection of ours on clarifying India Cement, clarification now we proceed to examine the interrelationship of Schedule	None
I Entry 54 and Schedule II Entry 23 which have been quoted and reproduced in the earlier part of this judgment.	None
Conflict in Entries (in the three lists in Seventh Schedule)	None
The analysis of decide cases as made by eminent constitutional jurist H.M. Seervai in his work on Constitutional Law of India (Fourth Silver Jubilee Edition, Vol. 3) is apposite.	None
Vide para 22.168, he states  	None
In Gov.Gen. in Council vs. Madras, 1945 FCR 179, the Privy Council laid down important principles for interpreting apparently conflicting legislative entries in general, and apparently conflicting tax entries in particular.	None
The Privy Council held, first, that though a tax in List I (e.g. a duty of excise) and a tax in List II (e.g. a tax on the sale of goods) of the Government of India Act, 1935, may overlap, in fact there would be no overlapping in law, if the taxes were separate and distinct imposts secondly, that the machinery of tax collection did not affect the real nature of a tax.	None
Another principle for reconciling apparently conflicting tax entries follows from the fact that a tax has two elements the person, thing or activity on which the tax is imposed, and the amount of the tax.	None
The amount may be measured in many ways but decided cases establish a clear distinction between the subject matter of a tax and the standard by which the amount of tax is measured.	Reasoning
These two elements are described as the subject of a tax and the measure of a tax.	Reasoning
In D.G. Gouse vs. Kerala  (1980) 2 SCC 410 , which is considered later, the above passage was quoted with approval by the Supreme Court as stating precisely the two elements involved in almost all tax cases, namely, the subject of a tax and the measure of a tax.	None
It is necessary to examine the scheme underlying the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.	None
We are relieved of the need of embarking upon any maiden voyage in this direction in view of the availability of a Constitution Bench decision in M.P.V. Sundararamier Co. vs. The State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr.	None

SCR 1422.	None
Venkatarama Aiyar, J., speaking for the Constitution Bench, traced the history of legislations preceding the Constitution, analysed the scheme underlying the division of legislative powers between the Centre and the States and then succinctly summed up the quintessence of the analysis.	None
It was held, inter alia In List I, Entries 1 to 81 mention the several matters over which Parliament has authority to legislate.	None
Entries 82 to 92 enumerate the taxes which could be imposed by a law of Parliament.	None
An examination of these two groups of Entries shows that while the main subject of legislation figures in the first group a tax in relation thereto is separately mentioned in the second.	None
In List II, Entries 1 to 44 form one group mentioning the subjects on which the States could legislate.	None
Entries 45 to 63 in that List from another group, and they deal with taxes.	None
Taxation is not intended to be comprised in the main subject in which it might on an extended construction be regarded as included, but is treated as a distinct matter for purposes of legislative competence.	None
And this distinction is also manifest in the language of Art.	None
248, Cls.	None
(1) and (2) and of Entry 97 in List I of the Constitution.	None
Under the scheme of the Entries in the Lists, taxation is regarded as a distinct matter and is separately set out.	None
The entries in the Legislative Lists must be construed breadly and not narrowly or in a pedantic manner.	None
The entries in the two Lists  List I and II  must be construed, if possible, so as to avoid conflict.	Reasoning
Faced with a suggested conflict between entries in List I and List II, what has first to be decided in whether there is any conflict.	None
If there is none, the question of application of the nonobstante clause subject to does not arise.	None
And, if there be conflict, the correct approach to the question is to see whether it was possible to effect a reconciliation between the two Entries so as to avoid a conflict and overlapping.	None
Illustration If it is possible to construe Entry 42 in List I as not including tax on interstate sales it should be so construed and the power to levy such tax must be held to be included in Entry 54 in List II (Entries as they existed preForty Second Amendment, 1976) (See Governor General in Council vs. Province of Madras  AIR 1945 PC 98 , and Province of Madras vs. Bodder Paidenna and Sons  AIR 1942 FC 33)	None
In the event of a dispute arising it should be determined by applying the doctrine of pith and substance to find out whether between two Entries assigned to two different legislatures the particular subject of the legislation fails within the ambit of the one or the other.	Reasoning
Where there is a clear and irreconcilable conflict of jurisdiction between the Centre and a provincial legislature it is the law of the Centre that must prevail.	Reasoning
(underlining by us)	None
Referring to M.P.V. Sundararamier Co. (supra) Sabyasachi Mukharji, J., (as his Lordship then was) speaking for six out of the seven Judges constituting the Bench in Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and others vs. State of U.P. and others  (1990) 1 SCC 109 held that under the constitutional scheme of division of powers in the Seventh Schedule, there are separate entries pertaining to taxation and other laws.	None
A tax cannot be levied under a general entry.	None
The abovesaid principles continue to hold that the field and have been followed in cases after cases.	None
General power of Regulation and Control does not include power of taxation.	None
One thing, which too is well settled by a series of decisions is that the power of regulation and control is separate and distinct from the power of taxation.	None
How this principle has been applied in myriad situations may be illustratively noticed.	None
The Constitution Bench in The HingirRampur Coal Co. Ltd. and others vs. The State of Orissa and others etc.  (1961) 2	Reasoning
SCR 537 , was faced with a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act, 1952.	None
The petitionercompany was engaged in producing and selling coal excavated from its collieries at Rampur in the State of Orissa.	None
The Act and the Rules framed and the notification issued thereunder levied the payment of cess on the petitioners Rampur Colliery.	None
The cause of action had arisen to the petitioner therein on account of the communications made to the company in March 1959 calling upon them to the monthly returns for the assessment of the cess which was levied by issuance of a notification dated June 24, 1958.	None
The challenge to the constitutional validity of the levy imposed by the impugned Act came to be examined by reference to Entry 54 in List I read with the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (Act No. 53 of 1948) as also by reference to Entry 52 in List I read with the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (Act No. 65 of 1951).	None
On behalf of the State of Orissa, the levy was defended as a fee relatable to Entries 23 and 66 in List II.	None
The Constitution Bench entered into an enquiry as to what is the primary object of the levy and the essential purpose which it is intended to achieve.	None
It was observed that its primary object and the essential purpose must be distinguished from its ultimate or incidental results or consequences, as that is the true test in determining the character of the levy.	None
The submission that the impugned levy could be either duty of excise or tax, was dismissed.	None
The Constitution Bench held that the form in which the levy is imposed and the extent of the levy, i.e. being too high, do not alter the character of the levy from a fee into that of a duty of excise.	None
The Constitution Bench laid down the features which would distinguish excise from a tax or fee and also the features which distinguished a tax from a fee though there is no generic difference in a tax and a fee, both being compulsory exactions of money by public authorities.	None
The scheme of the impugned Orissa Act was examined indepth and their Lordships found that the cess levied by the impugned Act was a fee.	None
The Act was passed for the purpose of the development of mining areas in the State.	None
Orissa is a poor State carrying in its womb a lot of mineral wealth of great potential value, but the areas where its mineral wealth is located lack infrastructure which would enable the exploitation of minerals.	None
The primary and the principal object of the Act was to develop the mineral areas in the State and to assist more efficient and extended exploitation of its mineral wealth.	None
The cess levied did not become a part of the consolidated fund and was not subject to an appropriation in that behalf it went into the special fund earmarked force carrying out the purpose of the Act and thus its existence established a correlation between the cess and the purpose for which it was levied, satisfying the element of quid pro quo in the scheme.	None
The scheme of the Act showed that the cess was levied against the class of persons owning mines in the notified area and to enable the State Government to render specific services to the said class by developing the notified mineral area.	None
Its application was regulated by a statute and was confined to its purposes.	None
There was a definite correlation between the impost and the purpose of the Act which was to render services to the notified area.	None
These features of the Act impressed upon the levy the character of a fee as distinct from a tax.	None
The interrelationship of Entries 23 and 66 in List II qua Entry 54 in List I was so stated by the Constitution Bench  The effect of reading of two Entries together is clear.	None
The jurisdiction of the State Legislature under Entry 23 is subject to the limitation imposed by the latter part of the said Entry.	None
If Parliament by its law has declared that regulation and development of mines should in public interest be under the control of the Union, to the extent of such declaration the jurisdiction of the State Legislature is excluded.	None
In other words, if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by Parliament as required by Entry 54, and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the impugned Act the impugned Act would be ultra vires, not because of any repugnance between the two statutes but because the State Legislature had no jurisdiction to pass the law.	None
The limitation imposed by the latter part of Entry 23 is a limitation on the legislative competence of the State Legislature itself.	None
The Constitution Bench then proceeded to test the validity of the cess by reference to two Central Acts, namely (A) the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (Act No. 53 of 1948) and (B) The Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (Act No. 65 of 1951).90.	Reasoning
(A) Act No. 53 of 1948 is a preconstitutional piece of Central Legislation.	Reasoning
It was found that the applicability of the Act which was initially attracted to mines as well as oil fields remained confined to oil fields in view of the subsequent parliamentary enactment, i.e. the MMDR Act, 1957 (Act No. 67 of 1957).	Reasoning
Therefore, the question which remained to be examined was only for the year 1952 as at that time the Act No. 53 of 1948 applied to mines as well as oil fields.	Reasoning
The factual constitutional position was that Act No. 53 of 1948 ceased to apply to Orissa postconstitution and assuming it applied yet there was no such declaration postconstitution made by Parliament as is referred to in Entry 23 in List II read with Entry 54 in List I and therefore in either case the validity of the said State Legislation was not impaired in spite of the finding recorded by the Court that there can be no doubt that the field covered by the impugned (State) Act is covered by the Central Act 53 of 1948.81.	Reasoning
(B) What is significant for our purpose is the law laid down by the Constitution Bench as to the validity of the impugned State legislation by reference to Act No. 65 of 1951, Section 2 whereof contained a declaration  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule as contemplated by Entry 52 in List I to which Entry 23 in List II is subject.	Reasoning
The first schedule included coal as an article as to which the industry engaged in the manufacture or production was brought within the purview of the Act.	Reasoning
Section 9 empowered the Central Government to levy cess for the purpose of the Act on all goods manufactured or produced in any scheduled industries including coal.	Reasoning
The Constitution Bench held that the Central Act was passed to provide for the development and regulation of certain industries one of which undoubtedly is coal mining industry.	Reasoning
The declaration made by Section 2 of the Act covered the same field as is covered by the impugned State Act.	Reasoning
Then the Constitution Bench held but in dealing with this question it is important to bear in mind the doctrine of pith and substance.	Reasoning
We have already noticed that in pith and substance the impugned Act is concerned with the development of the mining areas notified under it.	Reasoning
The Central Act, on the other hand, deals more directly with the control of all industries including of course the industry of coal.	Reasoning
Chapter II of this Act provides for the constitution of the Central Advisory Council and Development Councils, Chapter III deals with the regulation of scheduled industries, Chapter IIIA provides for the direct management or control of industrial undertakings by Central Government in certain cases, and Chapter IIB is concerned with the topic of control of supply, distribution, price, etc. of certain articles.	Reasoning
The last chapter deals with miscellaneous incidental matters.	Reasoning
The functions of the Development Councils constituted under this Act prescribed by S.6(4) bring out the real purpose and object of the Act.	Reasoning
It is to increase the efficiency or productivity in the scheduled industry or group of scheduled industries, to improve or develop the service that such industry or group of industries renders or could render to the community, or to enable such industry or group of industries to render such service more economically.	Reasoning
Section 9 authorises the imposition of cess on scheduled industries in certain cases.	Reasoning
Section 9(4) provides that the Central Government may hand over the proceeds of the cess to the Development Council there specified and that the Development Council shall utilize the said proceeds to achieve the objects mentioned in cls.	Reasoning
(a) to (d).	Reasoning
These objects include the promotion of scientific and industrial research, of improvements in design and quality, and the provision for training of technicians and labour in such industry or group of industries.	Reasoning
It would thus be seen that the object of the Act is to regulate the scheduled industries with a view to improvement and development of the service that they may render to the society, and thus assist the solution of the larger problem of national economy.	Reasoning
It is difficult to hold that the field covered by the declaration made by S.2 of this Act, considered in the light of its several provisions, is the same as the field covered by the impugned Act.	Reasoning
That being so, it cannot be said that as a result of Entry 52 read with Act LXL of 1951 the vires of the impugned Act can be successfully challenged.	Reasoning
Our conclusion, therefore, is that the impugned Act is relatable to Entries 23 and 66 in List II of the Seventh Schedule, and its validity is not impaired or affected by Entries 52 and 54 in List I read with the Act LXV of 1951 and Act LIII of 1948 respectively.	Reasoning
In view of this conclusion it is unnecessary to consider whether the impugned Act can be justified under Entry 50 in List II, or whether it is relatable to Entry 24 in List III and as such suffers from the vice of repugnancy with the Central Act XXXII of 1947.	None
(Underlining by us)	None
In spite of having held that the Central Act of 1951 was attracted to coal industries, their Lordships, by applying the doctrine of pith and substance, refused to annual the levy of cess under the impugned Orissa Act based on the following distinction Central Act, 1951 Deals more directly with the control of all industries including the industry of coal with a view to improvement and development of the service that they may render to the society and thus assist the solution of the larger problem of national economy.	None
State Legislation of 1952 Is concerned with the development of the mining areas notified under it.	None
Though both were cesses, one levied by the Central Act and the other levied by the State Act, inasmuch as they had different fields to operate, Entries 52 and 54 in List I were held not to have any adverse or denuding effect on the legislative competence of the State referable to Entries 23 and 66 in List II.	None
As a result, the writ petitions laying challenge to the constitutional validity of Orissa Act of 1952 were directed to be dismissed.	None
The distinction Here we will pause for a moment with a view to highlight a feature of singular significance in The Hingir Rampur Coal Co. as it would be the decisive factor for the applicability of the ratio of the case  where it would apply and where it would not.	None
Section 6 of the Act No. 43 of 1948 which came up for the consideration of the Constitution Bench, specifically provides  Power to make rules as respects minerals development (1) The Central Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, make rules for the conservation and development of minerals.	None
In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power, such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely xxx	None
xxx xxx the levy and collection of royalties, fees or taxes in respect of minerals mined, quarried, excavated or collected xx xx	None
xx	Facts
Rules to be laid before the Legislature  All rules made under any of the provisions of this Act shall be laid before the Central Legislature as soon as may be after they are made.	None
Thus, the power to levy and collect fees or taxes in respect of minerals mined, quarried, excavated or collected was expressly conferred on the Central Government by a specific provision made in that regard by the Act itself.	None
Because the power to levy tax or fee was appropriateed to itself by a Central Legislation it was held that the impugned Orissa Act  a State Legislation, could not have provided for the levy of a fee as by virtue of the Central Legislation, the Union having exercised its power to legislate, the field was covered and excepted from the legislative competence of the State.	None
Yet the recovery was held not liable to be annulled inasmuch as the Central Act No. 53 of 1948 was a preConstitution Legislation and as to which a declaration in terms of Entry 54 in List I was not made by the Parliament after the coming into force of the Constitution.	None
As to the Central Act of 1951, though it contained a declaration as contemplated by Entry 52 of List, I, and though it appelled to several goods including coal, the doctrine of pith and substance when correctly applied showed that the Central Act was intended for improvement of service while the State Act of 1952 was intended to deal with development of mining areas and the latter was valid.	None
The MMDR Act, 1957, which we are called upon to deal with, stands on much better footing for the writ petitioners herein as it does not contain any provision similar to Sections 6 and 10 of the Central Act No. 53 of 1948 or Section 9 of the Central Act No. 65 of 1951.	None
Challenge to levy under the abovesaid Orissa Act 27 of 1952 did not come to an end with HingerRampur Coal Co.	None
It was once again raised in the High Court with success and the State of Orissa came up in appeal which was heard and decided by a Constitution Bench in State of Orissa and another vs. M s. M.A. Tullochand Co. (1964) 4	None
SCR 461.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondent writpetitioner was working a manganese mine in the State of Orissa under a lease granted under the provisions of the MMRD Act, 1948.	None
The fee levied under the Orissa Act for the period of six quarters from September 30, 1956, to March 31, 1958, was under challenge.	None
The MMDR Act 1957 came into force w.e.f.	None
June 1, 1958.	None
The recovery impugned, therefore, related to the period preMMDR Act 1957 i.e. for the period during which Industries (Development and Regulation) Act 1951 was applicable.	None
The recovery was sought to be effected after the enactment and coming into force the Act No. 67 of 1957, though the recovery was referable to the period prior to it.	None
It was held that the demand was liable to be raised for the period for which it was raised and the validity of the demand was an issue concluded in HingirRampur Coal Co.	None
The demand having validity accrued prior to June 1, 1958, the recovery thereof could be validly enforced, notwithstanding the repeal of Act No. 65 of 1951, on the general principles of interpretation of statutes as also under Section 6 of the General Clauses Act.	None
Reiterating the findings in HingirRampur Coal Co. the Constitution Bench held that the impugned Act empowered the State Government to levy a fee on a percentage of the value of the mined ore at the pits mouth, the collections being intended for the development of the mining areas in the State.	None
This finding is very significant.	None
The Constitution Bench laid down the following principles which are relevant for our purpose  Entry 23 of the State List vests in the State Legislature power to enact laws on the subject of regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the Union.	None
It would be seen that subject to the provisions of List I the power to the State to enact Legislation on the topic of mines and mineral development is plenary.	None
The relevant provision in List I is, as already noticed, Entry 54 of the Union List.	None
To the extent to which the Union Government had taken under its control the regulation and development of minerals that much (i.e. to that extent) was withdrawn from the ambit of the power of the State Legislature under Entry 23 and legislation of the State which had rested on the existence of power under that entry would, to the extent of that control, be superseded or rendered ineffective, for here we have a case not of mere repugnancy between the provisions of the two enactments but of a denudation or deprivation of State legislative power by the declaration which Parliament is empowered to make, and has made.	None
The States would lose legislative competence only to the extent to which regulation and development under the control of the Union has been declared by Parliament to be expedient in the public interest.	None
It would be logical first to examine and analyse the State Act and determine its purpose, width and scope and the area of its operation and then consider to what extent the Central Act cuts into it or trenches on it.	None
As to the MMDR Act, 1957, the Constitution Bench in M.A. Tulloch observed by reference to Section 18 of the Act that the intention of Parliament was to cover the entire field and thus to leave no scope for the argument that until rules were framed there was no inconsistency and no supersession of the State Act.	None
The following holding of the above Constitution Bench is again worth noting that technically speaking the power to levy a fee is under the entries in the three lists treated as a subjectmatter of an independent grant of legislative power, but whether it is an incidental power related to a legislative head or an independent legislative power it is beyond dispute that in order that a fee may validity be imposed the subjectmatter or the main head of legislation in connection with which the fee is imposed is within legislative power.	None
The material words of the Entries are Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List.	None
It is, therefore, a prerequisite for the valid imposition of a fee that it is in respect of a matter in the list.	None
If by reason of the declaration by Parliament the entire subjectmatter of conservation and development of minerals has been taken over, for being dealt with by Parliament, thus depriving the State of the power which it therefor possessed, it would follow that the matter in the State List is, to the extent of the declaration, substracted from the scope and ambit of Entry 23 of the State List.	None
There would, therefore, after the Central Act of 1957, be no matter in the List to which the fee could be related in order to render it valid.	None
In the last but one para of M.A. Tulloch this sentence occurs  If this were the true position about the effect of the Central Act 67 of 1957 as the liability to pay the fee which was the subject of the notices of the demand had accrued prior to June 1, 1958, it would follow that these notices were valid and the amounts due thereunder could be recovered notwithstanding the disappearance of the Orissa Act by virtue of the superior legislation by the Union Parliament.	None
This observation, read out of the context and facts of the case alongwith the Court having referred to Sections 18 and 25 of the MMDR Act, 1957, creates an impression that the power to levy fee having been appropriated by the Central Legislation to the Central Government, the cess levied by the State would stand obliterated or repealed, is the holding by the Court.	None
But that is not the ratio of the case and it could not have been because in	None
HingirRampur Coal Co.	None
the Constitution Bench has clearly held to the contrary and the Constitution Bench in M.A. Tulloch has squarely followed the holding in	None
HingirRampur Coal Co.	None
Nobody should act on a assumption that in M.A. Tulloch the Constitution Bench has held  much less as a ratio of the decision  that under Act No. 67 of 1957 the Central Government has appropriate to itself the power to levy tax or cess on minerals or mineral bearing land.	None
All that the Court has said is that the 1957 enactment covers the field of legislation as to the regulation of mines and the development of minerals.	None
As Section 2 itself provides and indicates, the assumption of control in public interest by the Central Government is on (i) the regulation of mines, (ii) the development of minerals, and (iii) to the extent hereinafter provided.	None
The scope and extent of declaration cannot and could not have been enlarged by the Court nor has it been done.	None
The effect is that no State Legislature shall have power to enact any legislation touching (i) the regulation of mines (ii) the development of minerals, and (iii) to the extent provided by Act No. 67 of 1957.	None
The Preamble to the Central Act 67 of 1957 itself speaks  An Act to provide for the development and regulation of mines and minerals under the control of the Union.	None
Tax and fee is not a subject dealt with by Act No. 67 of 1957.	None
Let us demonstrate the same from the provisions of the Act and for that purpose relevant part of Section 13, subSection (1) and relevant part of subSection (2) of Section 18, subSection (3) of Section 18 and Section 25 are extracted and reproduced as under Power of Central Government to make rules in respect of minerals  (1) The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules for regulating the grant of reconnaissance permits, prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith.	None
In particular, and without prejudice to the generally of the foregoing power such, rules may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely (a) to (h) the fixing and collection of fees for reconnaissance permits, prospecting licences or mining leases, surface rent, security, deposit, fines, other fees or charges and the time within which and the manner in which the dead rent or royalty shall be payable.	None
Mineral development (1) It shall be the duty of the Central Government to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by prospecting or mining operations and for such purposes the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, make such rules as it thinks fit.	None
In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters, namely (a) to (o)  (Not reproduced) (p) to procedure for and the manner of imposition of fines for the contravention of any of the rules framed under this section and the authority who may impose such fines and (q) the authority to which, the period within which, the form and the manner in which applications for revision of any order passed by any authority under this Act and the rules made thereunder may be made, the fee to be paid and the documents which should accompany such applications.	None
All rules made under this section shall be binding on the Government.	None
Recovery of certain sums as arrears of land revenue  any rent, royalty, tax, fee or other sum due to the Government under his Act or the rules made thereunder or under the terms and conditions of any reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease may, on a certificate of such officer as may be specified by the State Government in this behalf by general or special order, be recovered in the same manner as an arrears of land revenue.	None
We have three comments to offer on M.A. Tulloch.	None
Firstly, the provisions of the Act No. 67 of 1957 did not directly come up for the scrutiny of the Constitution Bench as there was no demand raised after the commencement of this Act which was put in issue before the Constitution Bench the Constitution Bench was only adjudicating upon the issue whether a liability to pay cess incurred under the previous Act could be enforced under Act No. 67 of 1957 or in other words if Act No. 67 of 1957 had any castigating effect on the demand validly raised under the previous enactment.	None
Secondly, the extent which power to legislate by the States was excluded by the Central Act No. 65 of 1951 was not a question dealt with indepth as it was done in HingirRampur Coal Co.	None
Thirdly, M.A. Tulloch, if not correctly read, creates a wrong impression that Act No. 67 of 1957 provides for levy of tax and fee, which in fact it does not.	None
Section 13(2)(i) cannot be read as empowering the Central Government to levy and tax or fee.	None
The expression other fees and charges have to be interpreted ejusdem generis taking colour from other words and phrases employed in the same clause.	None
The word charges cannot and does include within its meaning any tax.	None
The expression other fees or charges must be assigned such meaning as to include therein only such fees and charges as are meant for regulation or development.	None
We are clear in our minds that a power to levy tax or fee cannot be spelled out from sections 13, 18 and 25 of the Act No. 67 of 1957.	None
It is wellsettled that power to tax cannot be inferred by implication, there must be a charging section specifically empowering the State to levy tax.	None
Section 18(2)(q) speaks of fee to be paid on applications for revision and not on minerals, minerals rights or mining land.	None
Section 25 speaks of recovery of tax and fee amongst others.	None
Two observations are spontaneous.	None
Firstly, a provision for recovery, being a machinery provision, cannot be read as empowering the levy of tax or fee.	None
Secondly, it speaks of tax or fee being due to the Government without defining the same and without qualifying the word Government with Central or State.	None
A perusal of several provisions of the Act and in particular Sections 9A, 15, 15 (1A)(a) and (g), 15(3), 17(3), 21(5) 25 goes to show that the power of recovery is invariably given to the State Government and obviously the word Government in Section 25 refers to the State, Government, which only is empowered to recover the sums due as arrears of land revenue.	None
The relevant principles of law laid down in M.A. Tulloch, which we have extracted and reproduced hereinabove, do not run contrary to the view we are taking in the present case.	None
The recovery of fee could have been held to be vitiated in that case because the field of mining activity in manganese ore was fully covered by the MMDR Act, 1957, and the levy under the impugned State Act, as found by the two Constitution Benches in HingirRampur Coal Co. and M.A. Tulloch was being collected for the development of the mining areas in the State.	Reasoning
The doctrine of pith and substance noted and applied in HingirRampur Coal Co. has been restated in M.A. Tulloch wherein the Constitution Bench had said, as noted hereinabove, that the Orissa Act was concerned with the development of the mining areas notified under the Act while the Central Act on the other hand dealt more directly with the control of all industries including of course the industry of coal and the object of the Central Act was to regulate the scheduled industry with a view to make improvement and development of the service that they may render to the society and thus assisting the solution of the larger problem of the national economy.	Reasoning
In spite of the declaration made by Section 2 of the Central Act of 1951 considered in the light of its several provisions it was found difficult to hold that the field covered by the Central Act was the same as the field covered by the impugned Orissa Act.	Reasoning
None of the two Constitution Benches have held that power to regulate and develop with which the Central Act of 1951 was concerned would include the power to levy tax and fee which power shall have to be traced to some other entry in List I. List I contains a general entry i.e. Entry 96 for levy of fee in respect of matters in List I but so far as levy of tax is concerned there are separate and specific entries (see Entries 82 to 92B in List I and Entries 45 to 63 in List II).	Reasoning
Further in view of Entry 50 of List II, Parliament can by any law relating to mineral development limit or place limitations on the power of the State Legislatures to impose taxes on mineral rights.	Reasoning
Power to tax not a residuary power107.	None
Article 265 mandates  no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.	Reasoning
The scheme of the Seventh Schedule reveals an exhaustive enumeration of legislative subjects, considerably enlarged over the predecessor Government of India Act.	Reasoning
Entry 97 in List I confers residuary powers on Parliament.	Reasoning
Article 248 of the Constitution which speaks of residuary powers of legislation confers exclusive power on the Parliament to make any law with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or the State List.	Reasoning
At the same time, it provides that such residuary power shall include the power of making any law imposing a tax not mentioned in either of those Lists.	Reasoning
It is, thus, clear that if any power to tax is clearly mentioned in List  II the same would not be available to be exercised by Parliament based on the assumption of residuary power.	Reasoning
The SevenJudges Bench in Union of India vs. Habhajan Singh Dhillon, (1971) 2 SCC 779 , ruled, by a majority of 43, that the power to legislate in respect of a matter does not carry with it a power to impose a tax under our constitutional scheme.	Reasoning
According to Seervai (Constitutional Law of India, Fourth Silver Jubilee Edition, Vol.3, para 22.191)	None
Although in Dhillons case conflicting views were expressed about the nature of the residuary power, the nature of that power was stated authoritatively in Kesvanandas case, (1973) 4 SCC 225.	None
Earlier, in Golak Naths case (AIR 1967 SC 1643 ), Subha Rao C.J. (for himself, Shah, Sikri, Shelat and Vaidyalingam JJ) had held that Art.	Reasoning
368 only provided the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution, but that the power to amend the Constitution was to be found in the residuary power conferred on Parliament by Arts.	Reasoning
245 and 246(1) read with entry 97, List I and by Art, 248 Seven out of the nine judges who overruled Golak Naths case held, inter alia, that the power to amend the Constitution could not be located in the residuary powers of Parliament.	Reasoning
Hegde and Mukherjee JJ held that  It is obvious that these Lists have been very carefully prepared.	None
They are by and large exhaustive.	None
Entry 97 in List I was included to meet some unexpected and unforeseen contingencies.	None
It is difficult to believe that our Constitution  makers who were keenly conscious of the importance of the provision relating to the amendment of the Constitution and debated that question for several days, would have left the important power hidden in entry 97 of List I leaving to the off chance of the courts locating that power in that entry.	None
We are unable to agree with those learned judges when they sought to place reliance on Arts.	None
245, 246 and 248 and entry 97 of List I for the purpose of locating the power of amendment in the residuary power conferred on the Union.	None
(italics supplied)	None
Similar views were expresed by five other judges.	None
According to Seervai, the law laid down in Kesavanandas case is that if a subject of legislation was prominently present to the minds of the framer of our Constitution, they would not have left it to be found by courts in the residuary power a fortiori, if a subject of legislative power was not only present to the minds of the framers but was expressly denied to Parliament, it cannot be located in the residuary power of Parliament.	None
Vide para 22.194 the eminent jurist poses a question Does Art.	None

246(1) read with Entry 97 List I to make laws in respect of any other matter not mentioned in List II and List III including any tax not mentioned in those Lists?	None
and answers by saying The answer is no.	None
As to the riddle arising in the context of mines and minerals development legislation by reference to the Entries in List I and Lists II, Seervai states  the regulation of mines and mineral development is a subject of exclusive State legislation, but for the limitation placed upon that power by making it subject to the provisions in that behalf in List I.	None
If Parliament does not exercise its power under Entry 54, List I, the States power under Entry 23, List II would remain intact.	None
If Parliament exercised its power under Entry 54, List I, only on a part of the field, as for example, major minerals, the States legislative power over minor minerals would remain intact.	None
(Para 22.195 at p.2433) Power to tax must be express, else no power to tax There is nothing like an implied power to tax.	None
The source of power which does not specifically speak of taxation cannot be so interpreted by expanding its width as to include therein the power to tax by implication or by necessary inference.	None

There is no such thing as taxation by implication.	None
The burden is always upon the taxing authority to point to the act of assembly which authorizes the imposition of the tax claimed.	None

Justice G.P. Singh in Principles of Statutory Interpretation (Eighth Edition, 2001) while dealing with general principles of strict construction of taxation statutes states A taxing statute is to be strictly construed.	None
The wellestablished rule in the familiar words of Lord Wensleydale, reaffirmed by Lord Halsbury and Lord Simonds, means The subject is not to be taxed without clear words for that purpose and also that every Act of Parliament must be read according to the natural construction of its words.	None
In a classic passage Lord Cairns stated the principle thus If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be.	None
On the other hand, if the Crown seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however apparently within the spirit of law the case might otherwise appear to be.	None
In other words, if there is admissible in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly, such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute where you can simply can simply adhere to the words of the statute.	None
Viscount Simon quoted with approval a passage from Rowlatt, J. expressing the principle in the following words In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said.	None
There is no room for any intendment.	None
There is no equity about a tax.	None
There is no presumption as to tax.	None
Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied.	None
One can only look fairly at the language used.	None
(at p. 635)	None
The judicial opinion of binding authority flowing from several pronouncements of this Court has settled these principles (i) in interpreting a taxing statute, equitable considerations are entirely out of place.	None
Taxing statutes cannot be interpreted on any presumption or assumption.	None
A taxing statute has to be interpreted in the light of what is clearly expressed it cannot imply anything which is not expressed it cannot import provisions in the statute so as to supply any deficiency (ii) before taxing any person it must be shown that he falls within the ambit of the charging section by clear words used in the Section and (iii) if the words are ambiguous and open to two interpretations, the benefit of interpretation is given to the subject.	None
There is nothing unjust in the taxpayer escaping if the letter of the law falls to catch him on account of Legislatures failure to express itself clearly.	None
(See, Justice G.P. Singh, ibid, pp.638639).	None
Power to tax is not an incidental power.	None
According to Seervai, although legislative power includes all incidental and subsidiary power, the impose a tax is not such a power under our Constitution.	None
It is for this reason that it was held that the power to legislate in respect of interstate trade and commerce (Entry 42, List I, Schedule 7) did not carry with it the power to tax the sale of goods in interstate trade and commerce before the insertion of Entry 92A in List I and such power belonged to the States under Entry 54 in List II.	None
Entry 97 in List I also militated against the contention that the power to tax is an incidental power under our Constitution (See Constitutional Law of India, H.M. Seervai, Fourth Silver Jubilee Edition, Vol. 3, para 22.20).	None
Power to regulate and control and power to tax  determining the nature of legislation by reference to the power exercised It is of paramount significance to note the difference between power to regulate and develop and power to tax.	None
The primary purpose of taxation is to collect revenue.	Reasoning
Power to tax may be exercised for the purpose of regulating an industry, commerce or any other activity, the purpose of levying such tax, an impost to be more correct, is the exercise of sovereign power for the purpose of effectuating regulation though incidentally the levy may contribute to the revenue.	Reasoning
Cooley in his work in Taxation (Vol. 1, Fourth Edition) deals with the subject in paragraphs 26 and 27.	Reasoning
There are some cases in which levies are made and collected under the general designation of taxes, or under some term employed in revenue laws to indicate a particular class of taxes, where the imposition of the burden may fairly be referred to some other authority than to that branch of the sovereign power to the state under which the public revenues are apportioned and collected.	Reasoning
The reason is that the imposition has not for its object the raising of revenue but looks rather to the regulation of relative rights, privileges and duties as between individuals, to the conservation of order in the political society, to the encouragement of industry, and the discouragement of pernicious employments.	Reasoning
Legislation for these purposes it would seem proper to look upon as being made in the exercise of that authority which is inherent in every sovereignty, to make all such rules and regulations as are needful to secure and preserve the public order, and to protect each individual in the enjoyment of his own rights and privileges by requiring the observance of rules of order, fairness and good neighbourhood, by all around him.	Reasoning
This manifestation of the sovereign authority is usually spoken of as the police power.	Reasoning
The power to tax must be distinguished from an exercise of the police power.	Reasoning
(State vs. Tucker, 56 U.S. 516).	Reasoning
The political power is a very different one from the taxing power, in its essential principles, though the taxing power, when a properly exercise, may indirectly tend to reach the end sought by the other in some cases.	Reasoning
(p.94) The distinction between a demand of money under the police power and one made under the power to tax is not so much one of from as to substance.	Reasoning
(p.95).	Reasoning
The distinction between a levy in exercise of police power to regulate and the one which would be in nature of tax is illustrated by Cooley by reference to a license.	Reasoning
He says  Socalled license taxes are of two kinds.	Reasoning
The one is a tax for the purpose of revenue.	Reasoning
The other, which is, strictly speaking, not a tax at all but merely an exercise of the police power, is a fee imposed for the purpose of regulation.	Reasoning
(p.97) Suppose a charge is imposed partly for revenue and partly for regulation.	None
Is it a tax or an exercise of the police power?	None
Other considerations than those which regard the production of revenue are admissible in levying taxes, and regulation may be kept in view when revenue is the main and primary purpose.	None
The right of any sovereignty to look beyond the immediate purpose of the general effect neither is nor can be disputed.	None
The government has general authority to raise a revenue and to choose the methods of doing so it has also general authority over the regulation of relative rights, privileges and duties, and there is no rule of reason or policy in government which can require the legislature, when making laws with the one object in view, to exclude carefully from its attention the other.	None
Nevertheless cases of this nature are to be regarded as cases of taxation.	None
If revenue is the primary purpose, the imposition is a tax.	None
Only those cases where regulation is the primary purpose can be specially referred to the police power.	None
If the primary purpose of the legislative body in imposing the charge is to regulate, the charge is not a tax even if it produces revenue for the public.	None
(Cooley, ibid, pp.9899).	None
This Court in sevenJudges Bench decision in Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and others vs. State of U.P. and others  (1990) 1 SCC 109 ), agreed that regulation is a necessary concomitant of the police power of the State.	None
However, it was an American doctrine and in the opinion of the Court it was not perhaps applicable as such in India.	None
The Court endorsed recognizing the power to regulate as a part of the sovereign power of the State exercisable by the competent legislature.	None
Brushing aside the need for discussion on the question  whether under the Constitution the States have police power or not, the Court accepted the position that the State has the power to regulate.	None
However, in the garb of exercising the power to regulate, any fee or levy which has no connection with the cost or expenses of administering the regulation, cannot be imposed only such levy can be justified as can be treated as part of regulatory measure.	None
Thus, the States power to regulate perhaps not as emanation of police power but as an expression of the sovereign power of the State has its limitations.	None
In our opinion, these observations of the Court lend support of the view which we have formed that a power to regulate, develop or control would not include within its ken a power to levy tax or fee except when it is only regulatory.	None
Power to tax or levy of augmenting revenue shall continue to be exercisable by the Legislature in whom it vests i.e. the State Legislature of spite of regulation or control having assumed by another legislature i.e. the Union.	None
State Legislation levying a tax in such manner or of such magnitude as can be demonstrated to be tampering or intermeddling with Centers regulation and control of an industry can perhaps be the exception to the rule just stated.	None
In Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. and others vs. State of U.P. and others  (1990) 1 SCC 109 the question before the sevenJudges Bench was as to the power of State to legislate on industrial alcohol as a subject.	None
Entry 8 in List II and Entry 33 in List III came up for consideration.	None
Their Lordships noticed the provisions of Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 (as amended in 1956), especially Section 18G thereof, and held that the provisions evinced clear intention of the Union to occupy the whole field relating to industrial alcohol and therefore the State could not claim to regulate it.	None
The power with regard to the control of alcoholic industries was considered and their Lordships concluded that in spite of the Central Legislation operating in the field the State was left with the following powers available to legislate in respect of alcohol  	None
It may pass any legislation in the nature of prohibition of potable liquor referable to Entry 6 of List II and regulating powers.	None
It may lay down regulations to ensure that nonpotable alcohol is not diverted and misused as a substitute for potable alcohol.	None
The State may charge excise duty on potable alcohol and sales tax under Entry 52 of List II.	None
However sales tax cannot be charged on industrial alcohol in the present case, because under the Ethyl Alcohol (Price Control) Orders, sales tax cannot be charged by the State on industrial alchol.	None
However, in case State is rendering any service, as distinct from its claim of so called grant of privilege, it may charge fee based on quid pro quo.	None
See in this connection, the observation of Indian Mica Case, (1971) 2 SCC 236.	None
It may be seen that the power to levy sales tax on industrial alcohol was available to the State but for the provisions of the Ethyl Alcohol (Price Control) Orders on account of which the State could not charge sales tax on industrial alcohol.	None
The State could levy any fee based on quid pro quo.	None
The sevenJudges Bench decision lends support to the view we are taking that in the field occupied by the Central for regulation and control, power to levy tax and fee is available to the State so long as it does not interfere with the regulation  the power assumed and occupied by the Union.	None
Before a sevenJudges Bench in The Automobile Transport (Rajasthan) Ltd. vs. The State of Rajasthan and others (1963) 1	None
SCR 491 , the question arose if State could make laws imposing regulatory restrictions on free trade, commerce and intercourse guaranteed by Article 301 of Constitution and whether a State tax could be treated as impeding freedom under Article 301 of Constitution.	None
The following statement of law by majority speaking through S.K. Das, J. (at pp.524525) is very much in point for our purpose Such an interpretation would, in our opinion, seriously affect the legislative power of the State Legislatures which power has been held to be plenary with regard to subjects in list II.	None
The States must also have revenue to carry out their administration and there are several items relating to the imposition of taxes in list II.	None
The Constitutionmakers must have intended that under those items the States will be entitled to raise revenue for their own purposes.	None
If the widest view is accepted, then there would be for all practical purposes, and end of State autonomy even within the fields allotted to them under the distribution of powers envisaged by our Constitution.	None
An examination of the entries in the lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution would show that there are a large number of entries in the State List (List II) and the Concurrent list (list III), under which a State Legislature has power to make laws.	None
Under some of these entries the State Legislature may impose different kinds of taxes and duties, such as property tax, sales tax, excise duty etc. and legislation in respect of any one of these items may have an indirect effect on trade and commerce.	None
Even laws other than taxation laws, made under different entries in the lists referred to above, may indirectly or remotely affect trade and commerce.	None
If it be held that every law made by the Legislature of a State which has repercussion on tariffs, licensing, marketing regulations, pricecontrol etc. must have the previous sanction of the President then the Constitution in so far as it gives plenary power to the States and State Legislatures in the fields allocated to them would be meaningless.	None
Their Lordships also observed (at p.526527) that the freedom guaranteed by Article 301 does not mean freedom from taxation.	None
The power of levying tax is essentially for the very existence of Government, though its exercise may be controlled by constitutional provisions made in that behalf.	None
Power to tax is not outside constitutional limitations.	None
It is for Parliament to exercise power in the field made available to it by Entry 52 and 54 in List I.	None
It is also for Parliament to state by law the limitations  and the sweep thereof  which it may choose to impose on field available to State for taxation by reference to Entry 50 in List II.	None
It may not be for Courts to venture into enquiry in just an individual case to find and hold what tax would hamper mineral development if Parliament has chosen to observe silence by not legislating or failed to say something explicit.	None
A reasonable tax or fee levied by State Legislation cannot, in our opinion, be construed as trenching upon Unions power and freedom to regulate and control mines and minerals.	None
India Cement and decisions post India Cement, based thereon India Cement is clearly distinguishable so far as the present cases are concerned.	None
As we have already pointed out it was a case of cess levied by State Legislature on royalty and not on mineral rights or land and buildings.	None
That is why the levy was held ultra vires.	None
Seervals comment and objective criticism on India Cement is noteworthy (see  ibid, para 22.257 C).	None
Royalty is income and State Legislatures are not competent to tax an income.	None
This single ground was enough to strike down the levy of cess impugned in India Cement.	None
Nothing more was needed.	None
The Orissa Cement Ltd., (supra) also, as the very opening part of the report shows, dealt with the levy of a cess by the State based on the royalty derived from mining lands which was held to be directly and squarely governed by India Cement and, therefore, struck down.	None
In State of Orissa and others vs. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. and others 1995 Supp.	Reasoning
(2) SCC 685, the impugned levy by the State Legislature was a tax of Rs. 32 per thousand acre on coal bearing lands.	Reasoning
It was sought to be defended as falling under Entry 49 or in the alternative under Entry 23 or Entry 50 in List II.	Reasoning
The attack was that the legislation being one on mineral lands and mineral rights and the Parliament having enacted the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, the field was entirely covered and the State Legislature was incompetent to levy the tax.	Reasoning
Reliance was placed on India Cement.	Reasoning
Orissa Cement and Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. (supra).	Reasoning
Only mineral bearing land and coal bearing land were the subject of the levy of tax.	Reasoning
The threeJudges Bench speaking through K.S. Paripoornan, J., concluded that the charging section of the impugned Act imposed a tax on the minerals also, and was not confined to a levy on land or surface characteristic of the land.	Reasoning
All nonmineral bearing lands and noncoal bearing lands were left out of the levy.	Reasoning
The levy was struck down as levying a tax not on land (related to surface characteristic of the land) but on minerals and mineral rights.	None
Goodrickes case (supra) was cited before their Lordships and it was observed that in Goodrickes case the impugned levy was held to be a tax on land and that makes all the difference.126.	None
We find it difficult to subscribe to the reasoning adopted in	None
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd.	None
Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. and others vs. State of West Bengal and others  (1989) 3 SCC 211 is a twoJudges Bench decision.	None
Rural employment cess was levied at the rate of Rs. 5 per kg.	None
on all dispatches of tea.	None
The rate was changed from time to time but that is not very material.	None
A careful reading of the report shows that the primary challenge was on the ground of the impugned cess being violative of Article 14 and 301 of the Constitution as it had the direct and immediate effect of impeding the movement of goods throughout the territory of India.	None
The challenge was sustained.	None
Incidentally, and very briefly, their Lordships have in one paragraph also dealt with the question of legislative competence of the State Government by reference to Entry 49 in List II.	None
Their Lordships have observed, if the legislation is in substance legislation in respect of dispatches of tea, legislative authority must be found for it with reference to some other entry.	None
No Entry in Lists II and III pertinent.	None
Moreover, the Union had, in public interest assumed control over the tea industry the tea trade and control of tea prices.	None
Therefore, the Court concluded that the impugned legislation was also void for want of legislative competence as it pertained to a covered field.	None
Suffice it to observe that to the extent the learned Judges have dealt with the challenge by reference to legislative competence of the State Legislature under Entry 49 in List II, there is not much of discussion and is just incidental and the observations are too wide to be countenanced.	None
Another distinguishing feature common to these decisions is that the distinction and demarcation of fields of operation between Central and State Acts by reference to the doctrine of pith and substance seems to have been not adverted to.	None
From Baijnath Kadio to Eastern Coalfields Before we proceed to deal with Goodricke, it will be necessary to complete the chain of though by referring to four decisions and the law which developed therewith between the years 1970 and 1982 which can be termed a period by itself on the issues at hand.	None
In Baijnath Kadio vs. The State of Bihar and others  (1969) 3 SCC 838 , the writpetitioners were holding mining leases for minor minerals.	None
The State of Bihar amended the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1964, whereby with effect from 27.1.1964 the rates of dead rent, royalty and surface rent were revised.	None
Additional demands were raised.	None
It was submitted that in view of the provisions contained in the MMDR Act 1957 incorporating (vide, Section 2 thereof) a declaration within the meaning of Entry 54, in List I, it was not competent for the State Legislature to revise the rates as abovesaid.	None
This Court held that the whole of the legislative field relating to minor minerals was covered by the Central Legislation by virtue of the declaration made by Section 2 and the enactment of Section 15 in the Act, thereby leaving no scope for the enactment of the second proviso to Section 10 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act whereunder the powers to increase the royalty, dead rent and surface rent were sought to be exercised.	None
There were pre existing old leases which could have been modified only by a legislative enactment made by the Parliament on the lines of Section 16 of Act No. 67 of 1957.	None
Any attempt to regulate such old mining leases will fall not in Entry 18 but in Entry 23 of List II even though the regulation incidentally touches them.	None
The pith and substance of the amendment of Section 10 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act falls within Entry 23 although it incidentally touches land and not vice versa.	None
Entry 18 did not come to the rescue of the State Government and Entry 23 was subject to the provisions of List I.	None
The impugned provision and the action taken thereunder were held ultra vires the Constitution.	None
The decisions of this Court in The HingirRampur Coal Co. Ltd. others and M s. M.A. Tulloch and Co. were referred to.	None
However, the law laid down by the Constitution Bench (vide para 13) is significant.	None
It held It is open to Parliament to declare that it is expedient in the public interest that the control should rest in Central Government.	None
To what extent such a declaration can go is for Parliament to determine and this must be commensurate with public interest.	None
Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down, the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by Parliament.	None
any legislation by the State after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the state Legislature, underlining by us H.R.S. Murthy Vs.	None
The collector of Chittoor and Anr.	None
(1964) 6	None
SCR 666 was a writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution laying challenge to the validity of notices of demand for the payment of land cess under the Madras District Boards Act, 1990.	None
The mining lease dated September 15, 1953, authorised the lessee to work and win iron or in a tract of land in Chittoor dead rent, royalty and surface rent were payable under the mining lease.	None
The District Board levied land cess on the annual rental value of all occupied lands.	None
The challenge to the constitutional validity of the land cess was dismissed.	None
The Court held It is therefore not possible to accept the contention, that the fact that the lessee or licensee pays a royalty on the mineral won, which is in excess of what he would pay if his right over the land extended only to the mere use of the surface land, places it in a category different from other types where the lessee uses the surface of the land alone.	None
In each case the rent which a lessee or licensee actually pays for the land being the test, it is manifest that the land cess is nothing else except a land tax.	None
When a question arises as to the precise head of legislative power under which a taxing statute has been passed, the subject for enquiry is what in truth and substance is the nature of the tax.	None
No doubt, in a sense but in a very remote sense, it was relationship to mining as also to the mineral won from the mine under a contract by which royalty is payable on the quantity or mineral extracted.	None
But that, does not stamp it as a tax on either the extraction of the mineral or on the mineral right.	None
it is unnecessary for the purpose of this case to examine the question as to what exactly is a tax on mineral right seeing that such a tax is not leviable by Parliament but only by the State and the sole limitation on the states power to levy the tax is that it must not interfere with a law made by Parliament as regards mineral development.	Arguments of Respondent
Our attention was not invited to the provision of any such law enacted by Parliament.	None
In the context of Ss. 78 and 79 and the scheme of those provisions it is clear that the land cess is in truth a tax on lands within Entry 49 of the State List.	None
The only decisions referred to in H.R.S. Murthy were	None

In State of Haryana and Anr.	None
Vs. Chanan Mal(1977) 1 SCC 340 , referring to the provisions of the MMDR act, 1957 and a State enactment of Haryana, (the constitutional validity whereof was under challenge) the Constitution Bench held that subject to the overall supervision of the Central Government, the State Government has a sphere of its own power and can take legally specified action under the central Act and rules made thereunder.	None
Thus, the whole field of control and regulation under the provisions of the central Act 67 of 1957 cannot be said to be reserved for the Central Government.	None
Western Coalfield Ltd.	None
Vs. Special Area Development Authority, Korba and Anr.	None
(1982 1 SCC 125 is a division.	None
The M.P. Municipality Act, a State enactment, levied property tax payable by the owner of the land of buildings and could also be recovered from the occupier of the land or the building in certain contingencies.	None
The validity of the property tax was upheld by reference to Entry 5 (Local Government) read with Entry 49 (Taxes on lands and buildings) in List II.	None
The availability of the MMDR Act, 1957, and the declaration incorporated in Section 2 thereof did not come in the way of the validity of the property tax inasmuch as the property tax levied by the State Government through municipalities had nothing to do with the development of mines.	None
The Court opined that the functions, powers and duties of municipalities did not become part of the occupied field by virtue of declaration under Section 2 of the Act No. 67 of 1957 and the competence of the State to enact laws for municipal administration will remain unaffected by that declaration.	None
Baijnath Kadio was distinguished.	None
Goodrickes Case134.	None
Now, we come to Goodrickes case.	Reasoning
The impugned provisions were incorporated by the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act 1989 into the West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973 and the West Bengal rural Employment and production Act, 1976.	Reasoning
Both the amendments were identical and have been set out in the earlier part of this judgment.135.	Reasoning
While the State sought to justify the levy of impugned cess by references to Entry 49 of List II, the writ petitioner laid challenge to the validity of levy on very many grounds.	Reasoning
It was submitted, firstly, that to bring the levy within the field of Entry 49 of List II it must be directly upon the land whereas the levy in question is really a tax on production of tea, a subject covered by Entry 84 of List	Reasoning
I secondly, that a tax on land must be constant figure whereas the impugned levy varies from year to year based as it is on the quantity of tea produced in a tea estate in a given year and where there is no production of tea leaves at all in a particular year, no cess would be payable by tea estate in that year thirdly that the definition of tea estate further establishes the absence of any nexus between cess and the land land covered by the factory and building and even fallow land, is included within the meaning of tea estate and if no tea leaves are produced and plucked, there would not be levy on the estate at all and fourthly, that the levy is clearly invalid in view of the sevenJudges Bench decision of this Court in India Cement and the threeJudges Bench decision in Orissa Cement.	Reasoning
It was urged that the impugned amendment was brought to remove the defect in the levy pointed out in Buxa Dooars, but the flow was persisting.	Reasoning
Jeevan Reddy, J., spoke for the threeJudges Bench, placing on record their unanimous opinion.	Reasoning
The Court noticed, vide para 10, the real factual situation as general obtains about the tea estate.	Reasoning
The definition of tea estate as incorporated by the amendment is a wellunderstood entity and hence is legitimately and reasonably capable of being classified as a separate category for the purpose of taxation and the rate of tax.	Reasoning
The Court, on a nearexhaustive review of the available decisions on the point, arrived at a few conclusions which, so far as relevant for our purposes, are summed up as under(i) a financial levy must have a made of assessment but the mode of assessment does not determine the character of a tax.	Reasoning
the nature of machinery of assessment is often complicated and is not of much assistance except insofar as it may throw light on the general character of the tax.	Reasoning
The annual value is not necessarily an actual income but only a standard by which income may be measured.	Reasoning
Merely because the some standard or mechanism of assessment has been adopted in a legislation covered by an entry under the Union List and also by a legislation covered by an entry in the State List, the latter legislation cannot be said to have encroached upon the field meant for the former(ii) the subject of tax is different from the measure of the levy(iii) merely because a tax on land or building is imposed by reference to its income or yield, it does not cease to be a tax on land or building.	Reasoning
The income or yield of the land building is taken merely as a measure of the tax it does not alter the nature or character of the levy.	Reasoning
It still remains a tax on land or building.	Reasoning
No one can say that a tax under a particular entry must be levied only in a particular manner.	Reasoning
the legislature is free to adopt such method of levy as it chooses.	Reasoning
So long as the essential character of levy is not departed from within the four corners of the particular entry, the manner of levying the tax would not have any vitiating effect(iv) ample authority is available to hold that a tax on land within the meaning of Entry 49 of List II can be levied with reference to the yield of income.	Reasoning
whether an agricultural land or an orchard or a tea estate, they do require some capital and labour to make them yield or to produce income which yield or income can without difficulty be taken as measure for quantifying the tax which would undoubtedly be a levy on the land(v)	Reasoning
It is not an essence of a tax, nor a condition of its validity, that the tax must be constant and uniform for all the years or for a particular number of years.	Reasoning
The tax on land or building can be levied and assessed by reference to previous years income or yield.	Reasoning
In short, it is open to the State Legislature to adopt such formula as it thinks appropriate for levying the tax and so long as the character of the tax remains the same as contemplated by the entry, it does not matter how the tax is calculated, measured or assessed(vi)	Reasoning
It is permissible to classify land by reference to its user as a separate unit for the purpose of levy of cess.	Reasoning
Tea estate, as a separate category of land, is a valid classification(vii) the fact that the Tea Act empowers the Central Government to levy a duty or cess upon tea or tea leaves for the purposes of that Act, can in no manner deprive the State Legislature of its power to tax the land comprised in a tea estate.	Reasoning
By levying the cess the State Legislature is not seeking to control the cultivation of tea but only to levy the tax on land comprised in a tea estate.	Reasoning
The fact that ultimately the tax may have to be borne by the tea industry is no ground for holding that the said levy is upon the tea industry.	Reasoning
The State Legislature is not denuded of its power to levy a tax upon the land or upon a building merely because such land or building is held or owned by an industry which is governed by a central legislation.136.	Reasoning
On applying the abovesaid principles the Court concluded that taking the quantum of yield of a tea estate for measuring the amount of tax is perfectly valid and cannot be equated to the situation in India Cement.	Reasoning
We may observe that the reasoning adopting in Goodricke accords with the reasoning in HingirRampur.137.	Reasoning
Having made an independent review of several judicial decisions and the several settled legal principles, as dealt with hereinabove, we are satisfied that the Goodrickes case (supra) was correctly decided and the law laid down therein is correct and supported by authority in abundance.	Reasoning
The distinguishing features which exclude the applicability of law laid down in India Cement and Orissa Cement to the fact situations like the ones we are called upon to deal with, were rightly pointed out in Goodricke and those very reasons additionally explained by us do not permit the cases on hand being ruled by India Cement and Orissa Cement.	Reasoning
In a nutshell138.	None
The relevant principles culled out from the preceding discussion are summarized as under(1)	Reasoning
In the scheme of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule, there exists a clear distinction between the general subjects of legislation and heads of taxation.	Reasoning
They are separately enumerated.(2) Power of regulation and control is separate the distinct from the power of taxation and so are the two fields for purposes of legislation.	Reasoning
Taxation may be capable of being comprised in the main subject of general legislative head by placing an extended construction, but that is not the rule for deciding the appropriate legislative field for taxation between List I and List II.	Reasoning
As the fields of taxation are to be found clearly enumerated in Lists I and II, there can be no overlapping.	Reasoning
There may be overlapping in fact but there would be no overlapping in law.	Reasoning
The subject matter of two taxes by reference to two Lists being different simply because the methodology or mechanism adopted for assessment and quantification is similar, the two taxes cannot be said to be overlapping.	Reasoning
This is the distinction between the subject of a tax and the measure of a tax.(3)	Reasoning
The nature of tax levied is different from the measure of tax.	Reasoning
While the subject of tax is clear and well defined, the amount of tax is capable of being measured in many ways for the purpose of quantification.	Reasoning
Defining the subject of tax is a simple task devising the measure of taxation is a far more complex exercise and therefore the legislature has to be given much more flexibility in the latter field.	Reasoning
The mechanism and method chosen by Legislature for quantification of tax is not decisive of the measure of tax though it may constitute one relevant factor out of many for throwing light on determining the general character of the tax.(4	Reasoning
) Entries 52, 53 and 54 in List I are not heads of taxation.	Reasoning
They are general entries.	Reasoning
Fields of taxation covered by Entries 49 and 50 in List II continue to remain with State Legislatures in spite of Union having enacted laws by reference to Entries 52, 53, 54 in List I.	Reasoning
It is for the Union to legislate and impose limitations on States otherwise plenary power to levy taxes on mineral rights or taxes on lands (including mineral bearing lands) by reference to Entry 50 and 49 in List II and lay down the limitations on States power, if it chooses to do so, and also to define the extent and sweep of such limitations.(5)	Reasoning
The Entries in List I and List II must be so construed as to avoid any conflict.	Reasoning
If there is no conflict, an occasion for deriving assistance from nonobstante clause subject to does not arise.	Reasoning
If there is conflict, the correct approach is to find an answer to three questions step by step as underOne  Is still possible to effect reconciliation between two Entries so as to avoid conflict and overlapping?Two  In which Entry the impugned legislation falls by finding out the pith and substance of the legislation?andThree  Having determined the field of legislation wherein the impugned legislation falls by applying doctrine of pith and substance, can an incidental trenching upon another field of legislation be ignored?(6) Land, the term as occurring in Entry 49 of List II, has a wide connotation.	Reasoning
Land remains land though it may be subjected to different user.	Reasoning
The nature of user of the land would not enable a piece of land being taken out of the meaning of land itself.	Reasoning
Different uses to which the land is subjected or is capable of being subjected provide basis for classifying land into different identifiable groups for the purpose of taxation.	Reasoning
The nature of user of one piece of land would enable that piece of land being classified separately from another piece of land which is being subjected to another kind of user, though the two places of land are identically situated except for the difference in nature of user.	Reasoning
The tax would remain a tax on land and would not become a tax on the nature of its user.(7) To be a tax on land, the levy must have some direct and definite relationship with the land.	Reasoning
So long as the tax on land by bearing such relationship with the land, it is open for the legislature for the purpose of levying tax to adopt any one of the well known modes of determining the value of the land such as annual or capital value of the land or its productivity.	Reasoning
The methodology adopted, having an indirect relationship with the land, would not alter the nature of the tax as being one on land.(8)	Reasoning
The primary object and the essential purpose of legislation must be distinguished from its ultimate or incidental results or consequences, for determining the character of the levy.	Reasoning
A levy essentially in the nature of a tax and within the power of State Legislature cannot be annulled as unconstitutional merely because it may have an affect on the price of the commodity.	Reasoning
A State legislation, which makes provisions for levying a cess, whether by way of tax to augment the revenue resources of the State or by way of fee to render services as quid pro quo but without any intension of regulating the controlling the subject of the levy, cannot be said to have encroached upon the field of regulation and control belonging to the Central Government by reason of the incidence of levy being permissible to be passed on to the buyer or consumer, and thereby affecting the price of the commodity or goods.	Reasoning
Entry 23 in List II speaks of regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the Union.	Reasoning
Entries 52 and 54 of List I are both qualified by the expression declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.	Reasoning
A reading in juxtaposition shows that the declaration by Parliament must be for the control of industries in Entry 52 and for regulation of mines or for mineral development in Entry 54.	Reasoning
Such control, regulation or development must be expedient in the public interest.	Reasoning
Legislation by the Union in the field covered by Entries 52 and 54 would not like a magic touch or a taboo denude the entire field forming subject matter of declaration to the State Legislatures.	Reasoning
Denial to the State would extend only to the extent of the declaration so made by Parliament.	Reasoning
In spite of declaration made by reference to Entry 52 or 54, the State would be free to act in the field left out from the declaration.	Reasoning
The legislative power to tax by reference to Entries in List II is plenary unless the entry itself makes the field subject to any other entry or abstracts the field by any limitations imposable and permissible.	Reasoning
A tax or fee levied by State with the object of augmenting its finances and in reasonable limits does not ipso facto trench upon regulation, development or control of the subject.	Reasoning
it is different if the tax or fee sought to be levied by State can itself be called regulatory, the primary purpose whereof is to regulate or control and augmentation of revenue or rendering service is only secondary or incidental.(9)	Reasoning
The heads of taxation are clearly enumerated in Entries 83 to 92B in List I and Entries 45 to 63 in List II.	Reasoning
List III, the Concurrent List, does not provide for any head of taxation.	Reasoning
Entry 96 in List I, Entry 66 in List II and Entry 47 in List III deal with fees.	Reasoning
The residuary power of legislation in the field of taxation spelled out by Article 248 (2) and Entry 97 in List I can be applied only to such subjects as are not included in Entries 45 to 63 of List II.	Reasoning
it follow that taxes on lands and buildings in Entry 49 of List II cannot be levied by the Union.	Reasoning
Taxes on mineral rights, a subject in Entry 50 of List II can also not be levied by the union though as stated in Entry 50 itself the union may impose limitations on the power of the State and such limitations, if any, imposed by the Parliament by law relating to mineral development and to that extent shall circumscribe the States power to legislate.	Reasoning
Power to tax mineral rights is with the States the power to lay down limitations on exercise of such power, in the interest of regulation, development or control, as the case may be, is with the Union.	Reasoning
This is the result achieved by homogeneous reading of Entry 50 in List II and Entries 52 and 54 in List I. So long as a tax or fee on mineral rights remains in pith and substance a tax for augmenting the revenue resources of the State or a fee for rendering services by the State and it does not impinge upon regulation of mines and mineral development or upon control of industry by the Central Government, it is not unconstitutional.	Reasoning
The Resultindividual cases Coal Matters139.	None
Teh amendments incorporated by the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 1992 w.e.f. 1.4.1992 into the provisions of the West Bengal Primary Education Act 1973 and the West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act 1976 classify the land into three categories (i) coalbearing land, (ii) mineral bearing land (other than coal bearing land) or quarry and (iii) land other than the preceding two categories.	Reasoning
These three are welldefined classifications by reference to the user or quality and the nature of product which it is capable of yielding.	Reasoning
The cess is levied on the land.	Reasoning
The method of quantifying the tax is by reference to the annual value thereof.	Reasoning
It is wellknown that one of the major factors contributing to the value of the land is what it produces or is capable of producing.	Reasoning
Merely because the quantum of coal produced and dispatched or the quantum of mineral produced and dispatched from the land is the factor taken into consideration for determining the value of the land, it does not become a tax on coal or minerals.	Reasoning
Being a tax on land it is fully covered by Entry 49 in List II.	Reasoning
Assuming it to be a tax on mineral rights it would be covered by Entry 50 in List II.	Reasoning
Taxes on mineral rights lie within the legislative competence of the State Legislature subject to any limitation imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development.	Reasoning
The Central legislation has not placed any limitation on the power of the States to legislate in the field of taxation on mineral rights.	Reasoning
The challenge to constitutional validity of State legislation is founded on nonavailability of legislative field to State it has not been the case of any of the writ petitioners that there are limitations enacted by Central legislation and the State of West Bengal has breached or crossed those limits.	Reasoning
Simply because incidence of tax is capable of being passed on to buyers or consumers by the mine owners with an escalating affect on the price of the coal, it cannot be inferred that the tax has an adverse effect on mineral development.	Reasoning
Entry 23 in List II speaks of regulation of mines and mineral developments, subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the Union.	Reasoning
The Central Legislation has taken over regulation and development of mines and mineral development in public interest.	Reasoning
By reference to Entry 50 of List II and Entry 54 in List I, the Central legislation has not cast any limitations on the State Legislatures power to tax mineral rights, or land for the matter of that.	Reasoning
The impugned cess is a tax on coalbearing and mineralbearing land.	Reasoning
It can at the most be construed to be a tax on mineral rights.	Reasoning
In either case, the impugned cess is covered by Entries 49 and 50 of List II.	Reasoning
The West Bengal Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 1992 must be and is held to be intra vires the Constitution.140.	Reasoning
We also hold that Mahanadi Coalfields was not correctly decided in as much as India Cement Ltd. and Orissa Cement Ltd. were applied to the levy of a cess to which they did not apply.	Reasoning
The learned Judges, deciding Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. were, with respect, not right in forming the opinion that the cess was levied on minerals and mineral rights and not on land and hence the conclusion reached therein that the State Legislature did not have the legislative competence and that the State legislation trenched upon a field already occupied by Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 1957, a Central Legislation is incorrect.

State of West Bengal and Ors.	Reasoning
(1995) Supp.	Reasoning
1 SCC 707 to have been correctly decided the impugned levy on tea estates as levied by the West Bengal Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Act 1989, is held to be intra vires the Constitution.	Reasoning
However, in brief, we may state that the impugned levy is of cesses on tea estates i.e. the land forming part of tea estates as defined in the impugned Act.	Reasoning
The land forming part of the tea estates is a welldefined classification.	Reasoning
Simply because the method for quantifying the tax is by reference to the yield of the land determinable by taking into account the quantum of tea produced and dispatched, it does not become a cess on tea or a tax on production of tea or a tax on income of land.	Reasoning
The Tea Act of 1953 contains a declaration vide Section 2 thereof that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the tea industry.	Reasoning
The declaration is in terms of Entry 52 in List I. Unions assumption of control of tea as industry and as being expedient in the public interest, does not amount to vesting the power to tax or levy fee in the Central Government by reference to tea or on tea estates.	Reasoning
Section 25 of Tea Act empowers the Central Government to levy and collect excise duty on tea produces, which on collection shall be credited to the Consolidated Fund of India.	Reasoning
There is no other provision in Tea Act empowering levy of any tax or fee on tea or tea bearing land.	Reasoning
The impugned cess is a tax on teabearing land, a welldefined classification ad is covered by Entry 49 in List II.	Reasoning
We uphold the logic and reasoning assigned and conclusions drawn by this Court in Goodricke on all the counts.(C) Bricks Earth Matters142.	Reasoning
Brick earth is a minor mineral.	Reasoning
What we have stated about the impugned cess by reference to coal applies to brick earth as well.	Reasoning
The field as to taxation cannot be said to have been covered by Central Legislation by reference to Entry 54 in Schedule I. Quantification of levy by reference to quantity of brick earth dispatched is a methodology adopted for the purpose of finding out the quantity of brick earth removed from the land.	Reasoning
It has a definite and direct corelation with the land.	Reasoning
There is no particular charm about the challenge developed by the writ petitioners laying emphasis on the meaning of the word dispatched.	Reasoning
The gist and substance of what the legislature is taking into account is the brick earth actually removed.	Reasoning
Dispatched has the effect of taking into account the brick earth removed and not simply moved and left behind.	Reasoning
The average quantity of brick earth utilized in making bricks whether on the brick field itself or on a place nearby, does involve removal  and consequently dispatch  of the brick earth from the place where it was to the place where it is captively consumed in making bricks.	Reasoning
The fact that methodology for working out the royalty payable and the cess payable is the same, does not have any detrimental effect on the constitutional validity of the cess whether it be treated as one on the land  classified by reference to its production, i.e. the brick earth or as one on mineral rights in brick earth.	Reasoning
In either case it would be covered by Entries 49 of 50 in List II.	Reasoning
None of the pleas raised has any merit.	None
Minor Mineral Matters While narrating the facts, we have quoted in the earlier part of the judgment Section 35 of the U.P. Special Area Development Authorities Act, 1986 (SADA Act, for short) which is the charging section and the Rules framed under the Act.	None
We refer to other relevant provisions of the Act in brief.	None
Section 3 of the SADA Act authorizes the State Government to declare by notification an area to be a special development area upon its forming an opinion that any area of special importance in the State needs to be developed in a planned manner.	None
The authority is empowered to prepare a master plan for the special development area, to provide for the development of lands in the area, to compulsorily acquire land and so on.	None
the powers are drastic and alloriented with the object of effecting a planned intensive and extensive development of an area as to which the State Government may have formed an opinion that it was an area of special importance.	None
Declaring an area as a special development area in view of its special importance and constituting an authority for the administration and management of the area entrusted with the obligation of its development is not a matter of empty formality.	None
The empowerment of the authority is accompanied by an obligation cast on it by the State Government through the special legislation of fulfilling the object behind the declaration of special area and constitution of the authority.	None
The Act has been given an overriding effect by virtue of Section 52 thereof.	None
Not only the area is taken out of the administration by the other bodies of local selfgovernment such as municipality or panchayat, but any other master plan or development plan formulated by any other authority ceases to apply to such area.	None
It was contended on behalf of the writ petitionersappellants that whether a major or a minor mineral, by virtue of the provisions contained in the MMDR Act, 1957 and U.P. Mine Minerals Concession Rules 1963, framed in exercise of the power conferred by Section 15 of the MMDR Act, the mineral rights in any land are subject to payment of royalty which is fixed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 8 and 9 of the MMDR Act confer the power to enhance or reduce the rate at which royalty or dead rend shall be payable in respect of any mineral.	Arguments of Petitioner
Any cess levied by the State Government would have the effect of increasing the royalty.	Arguments of Petitioner
Section 2 of the MMDR Act makes the requisite declaration to the effect that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such declaration is in the terms contemplated by Entry 54 of List I. It was submitted that the levy of cess by the State Government would be clearly repugnant to the power reserved by the Constitution and the MMDR Act to be exercised only by the Central Government and hence the impugned levy of cess is repugnant to the central legislation.	Arguments of Petitioner
To test the validity of the submission we have to examine the real nature of the levy and encroaches upon the field reserved for central legislation.	Arguments of Petitioner
All the minerals form part of the land.	None
Minerals are conceived by the mother earth by the process of nature and natured over innumerable number of years and delivered on their assuming value and utility for the earthings.	None
Generally and broadly speakingand that would suffice for our purpose, a mine is an excavation in the earth which yield minerals.	None
Mineral is something which grows in a mine and is capable of being won or extracted so as to be subjected to a better or precious use.	None
Until extracted, the mineral forms part of the crust of the earth.	None
A mineral right, according to Blacks Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition) is the right to search for, develop, and remove materials from the land.	None
It also means the right to receive a royalty based on the production of minerals which right is usually granted by a mineral lease.	None
In both the senses, the right vests in the owner of the land and is capable of being parted with.	None
It is well settled that it is for the legislature to draft a piece of legislation by making the choicest selection of words so as to give expression to its intention.	None
The ordinary rule of interpretation is that the words used by the legislature shall be given such meaning as legislature has chosen to assign them by coining definitions contained in the interpretation clause and in absence thereof the words would be given such meaning as they are susceptible of in the ordinary parlance, may be by having recourse to dictionaries.	None
However still, the interpretation is the exclusive privilege of the Constitutional Courts and the Court embarking upon the task of Interpretation would place such meaning on the words as would effectuate the purpose of legislation avoiding absurdity, unreasonableness, incongruity and conflict.	None
As is with the words used so is with the language employed in drafting a piece of legislation.	None
That interpretation would be preferred which would avoid conflict between two fields of legislation and would rather import homogeneity.	None
It follows as a corollary of the abovesaid statement that while interpreting tax laws the Courts would be guided by the gist of the legislation instead of by the apparent meaning of the words used and the language employed.	None
The Courts shall have regard to the object and the scheme of the tax law under consideration and the purpose for which the cess is levied, collected and intended to be used.	None
The Courts shall make endeavour to search where the impact of the cess falls.	None
The subject matter of levy is not to be confused with the method and manner of assessment of realisation.	None
It is true that once a central legislation declares regulation of mines and mineral development by law to be expedient in the public interest, the legislation relating to regulation of mines and development of minerals shall fall within the sweep of Entry 54 of List I.	None
The entry has to be liberally and widely interpreted.	None
Yet it cannot be lost sight of that the entry itself employs an expression to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law as qualifying the preceding expression stating the subject regulation of mines and minerals development.	None
Section 2 of MMDR Act too qualifies the relevant declaration by suffixing to it the expression to the extent hereinafter provided.	None
Section 15 of the Act has excepted and preserved the power of State Governments to make rules in respect of minor minerals.	None
The qualifying words used in Entry 54 of List I and in Section 2 of the MMDR Act contain an inbuilt indication that in spite of an inclination on the part of the Courts to be liberal in assigning a wide meaning to the scope of the said provisions, the boundaries of limitation are there and the expanse of these provisions cannot be so stretched as to strike at the State Legislations which are adequately accommodated within the field of an Entry in List II which too shall have to be meaningfully and liberally construed.	None
The MMDR Act enables control over the regulation of mines and the development of minerals being exercised by the Central Government through legislation.	None
The High Court has upheld the validity of the SADA Act by relating it to Entry 5 in List II which is local government.	None
Any local government exercising the power of governance over a local area shall have to administer, manage the develop the area lying within its territory which cannot be done without raising funds.	None
It is usual for every piece of legislation giving birth to an institution of local government to feed it by incorporating provisions conferring power of generating funds for meeting the expenses of governance.	None
The SADA Act intends to achieve a level of local governance which the usual models of local government such as boards and municipalities are not considered capable of achieving and that is why a special development area and a Special Area Development Authority.	None
The fund established under the Act meets expenses of administration needed to be incurred by the authority.	None
The funds cannot be utilized for any purpose other than the administration of the Act.	None
There are pieces of land which though containing a mine yet fall within the territory of special development area.	None
It was pointed out by the respondents before the High Court that in spite of the Act having been enacted in the year 1986 the successive State Governments, which had preceded, did not take care of the legislation and it was only the then government which became conscious of its obligations under the SADA Act and commenced identifying special areas requiring development such as Sonbhadra.	None
The imposition of cess envisaged through the SADA Act and the Rules was a step towards developing the special area.	None
it is matter of common knowledge, and does not need any evidence to demonstrate, that mining activity carried on the land within the special area involves extraction, removal, loadingunloading, and transportation of the minerals accompanied by its natural consequences entailed on the environment and the infrastructure such as roads, water and power supply etc. within the special area.	None
The impugned cess can, therefore, be justified as a fee for rendering such services as would improve the infrastructure and general development of the area the benefits whereof would be availed even by the stone crushers.	None
Entry 66 in List II is available to provide protective constitutional coverage to the impugned levy as fee.	None
As held in Goodricke Group Ltd., 1995 Supp.	None
(1) SCC 707, which we have held as correctly decided, this Court has noted the principle of law well established by several decisions that the measure of tax is not determinative of its essential character.	None
The same transaction may involve two or more taxable events in its different aspects.	None
Merely because the aspects overlap, such overlapping does not detract from the distinctiveness of the aspects.	None
In our opinion, there is no question of conflict solely on account of two aspects of the same transaction being utilized by two legislatures for two levies both of which may be taxes or fees or one of which may be a tax and other a fee falling within two fields of legislation respectively available to the two.	None
As we have pointed out earlier, a cess may be tax or fee.	None
So far as the present case is concerned, this distinction does not need any further enquiry by reference to the facts of the case inasmuch as the impugned cess is constitutionally valid considered whether a tax or a fee.	None
We do not propose to continue dealing therewith any more inasmuch as it would be an exercise in futility.	None
We would only place on record briefly our reasons for upholding the validity of the impugned levy whether a tax or a fee.	None
As a tax the impugned levy of cess is clearly covered by Entry 5 of List II (as the High Court has held, and we add) read with Entries 49, 50 and 66 of List II.	Reasoning
There is no challenge to the declaration of the area as a special development area and the constitution of Special Area Development Authority for the administration thereof.	Reasoning
In other words, the constitutional validity of the enactment as a whole and the rules framed thereunder is not put in issue.	Reasoning
What is under challenge is only the levy of cess.	Reasoning
There is nothing wrong in the state legislation levying cess by way of tax so as to generate its funds.	Reasoning
Although it is termed as a cess on mineral right, the impact thereof falls on the land delivering the minerals.	Reasoning
Thus, the levy of cess also falls within the scope of Entry 49 of List II.	Reasoning
Inasmuch as the levy on mineral rights does not contravene any of the limitations imposed by the Parliament by law relating to mineral development, it is also covered by Entry 50 of List II.	Reasoning
The power to levy any tax or fee lying within the legislative competence of the State Legislature can be delegated to an institution of local government constituted by law within the meaning of Entry 5 in List II.	Reasoning
The Entries 5, 23, 49, 50 and 66 of List II provide adequate constitutional coverage to the impugned levy of cess.	Reasoning
True it is that the method of quantifying the cess is by reference to the quantum of mineral produced.	Reasoning
This would not alter the character of the levy.	Reasoning
There are myriad methods of calculating the value of the land for the purpose of quantifying the tax reference whereto has already been made by us in the other part of this judgment.	Reasoning
Validity of cess upon the land quantified by reference to the quantity of its produce was held to be a levy on the land and hence constitutional in Ralla Ram, AIR 1949 FC 81, Moopil Nair, AIR 1961 SC 552 and Aja Kumar Mukherjee, AIR 1965 SC 1561 .	Reasoning
It does not become excise duty on manufacture and production of goods merely on account of having relation with the quantity of product yielded of the land.	Reasoning
Rather it is a safe, sound and scientific method of determining the value of the land to which the product relates.	Reasoning
They levy of cess considered as a tax is constitutionally valid.	Reasoning
In Western Coalfields Ltd.	None
Vs. Special Area Development Authority, Korba Anr.	None
(1982) 1 SCC 125 , the levy of a cess almost similar to the one in issue in the present case, came up for the consideration of this Court.	None
The levy was for the purpose of enabling the municipal administration to exercise its power and discharge its functions under the Act.	None
It was held that the declaration contained in Section 2 of the MMDR act does not have the effect of bringing the powers, duties and functions of the local authority within the purview of accupied field.	None
The power to levy tax on lands and buildings within their jurisdiction by the local authority was upheld by this Court.	None
The following observations of Constitution Bench in HingirRampur Coal Co. squarely apply to SADA Act and SADA Rules for upholding their constitutional validity in pith and substance the impugned Act is concerned with the development of the mining areas notified under it.	None
The Central Act, on the other hand, deals more directly with the control of all industries including of course the industry of coal.	Reasoning
The functions of the Development Councils constituted under this Act prescribed by Section 6(4) bring out the real purpose and object of the Act.	Reasoning
It is to increase the efficiency of productivity in the scheduled industry of group of scheduled industries, to improve or develop the service that such industry or group of industries renders or could render to the community, or to enable such industry or group of industries to render such service more economically.	Reasoning
the object of the (Central) Act is to regulate the scheduled industries with a view to improvement and development of the service that they may render to the society, and thus assist the solution of the larger problem of national economy.	Reasoning
It is difficult to hold that the field covered by the declaration made by Section 2 of this Act, considered in the light of its several provisions, is the same as the field covered by the impugned Act.	Reasoning
The being so, it cannot be said that as a result of Entry 52 read with Act LXV of 1951 the vires of the impugned Act can be successfully challenged.	Reasoning
Our conclusion, therefore, is that the impugned Act is relatable to Entries 234 and 66 in List II of the Seventh Schedule, and its validity is not impaired or affected by Entries 52 and 54 in List I read with Act LXV of 1951 and Act LIII of 1948 respectively.	Reasoning
As stated earlier also, the impugned cess can be justified as fee as well.	None
The term cess is commonly employed to connote a tax with a purpose or a tax allocated to a particular thing.	None
However, it also means an assessment or levy.	None
Depending on the context and purpose of levy, cess may not be a tax it may be a fee or fee as well.	None
It is not necessary that the services rendered from out of the fee collected should be directly not proportion with the amount of fee collected.	None
It is equally not necessary that the services rendered by the fee collected should remain confined to the persons from whom the fee has been collected.	None
Availability of indirect benefit and a general nexus between the person bearing the burden of levy of fee and the services rendered out of the fee collected is enough to uphold the validity of the fee charged.	None
The levy of the impugned cess can equally be upheld by reference to Entry 66 read with Entry 5 of Schedule II.	None
Royalty is not a tax.	Reasoning
The impugned cess by no stretch of imagination can be called a tax on tax.	Reasoning
The impugned levy also does not have the effect of increasing the royalty.	Reasoning
Simply because the royalty is levied by reference to the quantity of the minerals produced and the impugned cess too is quantified by taking into consideration the same quantity of the mineral produced, the latter does not become royalty.	Reasoning
The former is the rent of the land on which the mine is situated or the price of the privilege of winning the minerals from the land parted by the government in favour of the mining lessee.	Reasoning
The cess is a levy on mineral rights with impact on the land and quantified by reference to the quantum of minerals procuded.	Reasoning
The distinction, though fine, yet exists and is perceptible.	None

Judgment B. Sinha, J.  Introduction Coal and Tea play important roles in the development of economy of the country.	None
Coal has been subject matter of regulatory measures even under the Defence of India Rules.	None
Production, distribution, supply and price of coal were controlled and regulated under the Colliery Control Order, 1945.	None
The said order was continued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.	None
Under the Colliery Control Order, the Coal Controller was even authorized to allot quotas of coal to the Central Government as well as the State Government although the said procedure is not now in vogue, in view of decontrolling notification issued by the Central Government under the Colliery Control Order, 1945.	None
The quality of coal and the quantity required by all the consumers are regulated by the Coal Controller.	None
Coal was the only mineral which was subjected to nationalization, in terms of Coking Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1972 and Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973.	None

Even coal mining leases granted to the lessees stood terminated by reason of Section 4A of Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 in the year 1976.	None
Coal is used as a primary rawmaterial in many core sectors which are vital for the economy of the country, e.g. power, steel, oil, etc.	None
Fixation of price of coal by the Central government, regard being had to quality thereof, had all along been subjected to statutory orders.	None
The gradation of coal dependent upon the quality thereof was to be determined by the Coal Board constituted under the Coal Mines Conservation and Safety Act.	None
Quality of coal may depend not only on the location of the coal mines but also from the particular seems wherefrom it is extracted.	None
Requirement of maintenance of price of coal on an AllIndia basis had all along been considered to be imperative in the economic and industrial development of the country.	None
Despite the same, price of coal produced in India is considered to be on the high side a result whereof it is imported also from other countries despite its availability in abundance.	None
With a view to reduce the price of coal, the Central Government has recently even reduced the rate of custom duty.	None
Tea is also one of the important commodities having regard to its export potential.	None
An agency of the Central Government even furnishes guarantees to the exporters of tea for export thereof to several countries.	None

Brick Earth Matters The Bengal Brickfield Owners Association filed a writ petition questioning the validity of the impugned Acts inter alia on the ground that the field relating to minor mineral is covered by the 1957 Act and as such the State of West Bengal was denuded of its power to levy any cess on either extraction of brick earth or on despatch of bricks.	None
It has been urged that the operations involved in the manufacturing of bricks as set out in the writ petition are required to be considered by this Court, as being relevant to show that the Cess Act, 1880 is not applicable and that the notices issued demanding payment of cess are arbitrary.	None
Illegal and liable to be quashed being also in breach of the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India to run their business of manufacture and sale of bricks.	None
11.	None
it is averred that the brick earth extracted is mixed with sand, fibre and water and bricks are shaped with the help of moulds thereafter, the bricks are sundried and put in the kiln for baking at the required temperature to make finished marketable bricks.	None
The fuel used is coal.	None
All the operations from quarrying to manufacture of finished marketable bricks are carried out in the brickfield itself and brick earth is not removed from the quarrying field so much so the element of despatch of this minor mineral for sale or for any other purposes contemplated by Section 8(1)(b) and defined in Section 4 of the Cess Act, 1880 does not arise.	None
The writ petition was filed questioning a demand made at the rate of Rs. 12.50 paise per hundred cubit feet of extracted brick earth in relation whereto the Collector, Hooghly in purported exercise of its power under Section 72 of the Cess Act, 1880 directed each brick earth quarrier to file returns in the prescribed from on the average of despatch of brick earth for the previous three years failing which it was threatened that a daily fine of Rs. 50 would be imposed.	None
The said demand was referable to Section 6(1)(b) of the Bengal Cess Act, 1880.	None
The contention of the respondent is that the cess has been levied for securing the welfare of the people of the State as enshrined in Part IV of the Constitution of India.	None
It is, however, accepted that cess in assessed on annual despatches.	None
High Court Judgements Coal Matters Before the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court the sole question which was raised by the parties was as to whether the impugned statutes imposing cess are in part material with the statutes which have been held ultra vires by this Court in India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra).	None
The High Court in its impugned judgment in extenso referred to the provisions of Orissa Acts, Madhya Pradesh Act, Bihar Acts and compared the same with the impugned Acts, noticing that therein also the levy was apparently claimed on the land, but were declared unconstitutional.	None
The findings of this Court in India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra) were extensively quoted by the High Court.	None
The High Court found that all the three impugned acts provide that Cess shall be assessed or levied on different types of lands.	None
It observed that Section 6 of the Cess Act, deals with three types of immovable properties namely land, in respect of all mines, quarries and in respect of tramways, railways and other immovable property, whereas the West Bengal Primary Education Act devides the subject matter of the levy into broadly two categories in respect of Coal Mines and other mines, etc.	None
The Division Bench further observed that the impugned statutes having made those divisions, each of them provide for assessment of cess in respect of coal mines on the value of annual despatches of coal.	None
While holding that the impugned Acts as ultra vires in terms of decisions of this Court in India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra), the High Court applied the tests of real impact of substance of the levy holding that the levies in question after the amendment of 1992 are directly upon coal.	None
The High Court also relied upon the decision of this Court in The Federation of Mining Association of Rajasthan, and etc. etc.	None
Vs.	Decision
State of Rajasthan and another AIR 1992 SC 103 wherein a threeJudge Bench of this Court in relation to a similar levy rejected a contention that the Rajasthan Act provided for imposition of cess not only with reference to royalty but also on dead rent and, thus, it is possible to read that the State intended to impose the tax by reference to the amount of dead rent	None
9even if it is valid insofar as it purported to make royalty the basis of the tax).	None
Minor Mineral Matters The State of U.P. enacted U.P. Special Area Development Authorities of the Power conferred upon it, the State of U.P. framed rules under the said Act known as Shakti Nagar Special Area Development Authority (Cess on Mineral Rights) Rules, 1997, inter alia whereby and whereunder cess was levied on minerals on the ground that the special area development authority had been conferred with the powers of municipal corporation.	None
The writ petitions filed by Ram Dhani Singh and Others questioning imposing of cess in terms of Shakti Nagar Special Area Development Authority (Cess on Mineral Rights) Rules, 1997 was dismissed by the High Court of Allahabad on the ground that the said rules can be upheld in terms of Entry 5 of List II of the Seventh Scheduled of the Constitution of India.	None
Submissions State of West Bengal has been represented by Mr. Dwivedi in the coal matter and Mr. Reddy in the tea matter.	None
Their submissions would, therefore, be noticed separately.	None
Writ Petitioners and the Respondents, however, have been represented by a number of counsel.	None
ReCoal Matters Drawing our attention to a comparative chart of the Cess Act, West Bengal Primary Education Act, 1973 and West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act, 1976 as amended from time to time, Mr. Dwivedi would contend that as by reason of the amendments carried out therein in terms of West Bengal Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 1992 remedial measures as regard the deficiencies pointed out by this Court in India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra) were taken by the State of West Bengal, the High Court committeda manifest error in declaring the same unconstitutional.	None
The learned counsel would urge that the decisions rendered by this Court in India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra) would not be applicable in these matters as the levy has been imposed on the value of coal being yield from the land and not on royalty.	Arguments of Petitioner
Contention of Mr. Dwivedi is that the impugned levy would squarely come within the purview of Entry 49, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution on the following grounds(i) The impugned enactments exclude consideration of royalty from the value of coal and therefore royalty did not become apart of cess.(ii)	Arguments of Petitioner
Value of coal despatched from coal mine is only a basis of measure of cess as it has direct and definable relation with value of land.	Arguments of Petitioner
Produce of land has always been considered to have direct relevance in determining the value of land.(iii)	Arguments of Petitioner
That the quantum of levy is dependent upon production of coal being a matter of collection machinery, the same has no relevance to the essence thereof.(iv)	Arguments of Petitioner
Post amendment levy of cess being on the annual value of coal which is determined on the basis of sale price thereof but excluding royalty and other taxes and charges, the despatches of coal is not the determinative factor for the purpose of judging the nature of import.21.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the alternative it was submitted that cess imposed by reason of the impugned enactments would be sustainable with reference to Entry 50 of List II of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India as the same would be tax on mineral rights.22.	Arguments of Petitioner
By reason of the 1957 Act, the Parliament, Mr, Dwivedi would contend, is only empowered to make legislation so as to limit the State of its power to impose tax on mineral rights.	Arguments of Petitioner
Royalty according to the learned counsel has wrongly been held to be tax in India Cement.	Arguments of Petitioner
Submissions of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents, on the other hand, are(i) The impugned cess is beyond the legislative competence of the State either in terms of Entry 49 or in terms of Entry 50 of List II of the Seventh, Schedule of the Constitution.(ii)	Arguments of Respondent
As by reason of the impugned acts, cess has been levied on the value of coal despatched (before 1992) and on the value of coal produced 9after 1992), they having been levied on minerals and, thus, not either on mineral right or on land.(iii)	Arguments of Respondent
Although mineral is extracted from land but therefor three things are required viz.(a) land from which the mineral could be extracted(b) capital for providing machinery, instruments and other requirements(c) labourSuch a tax is neither a tax on land (Entry 49 of List II) nor on mineral rights (Entry 50 of List II), But a hybrid tax on mines plus capital plus labour.	Arguments of Respondent
It, thus, could only be imposed by the Parliament under Entry 97 of List I.(iv)	Arguments of Respondent
In any event, no tax on mineral right can be imposed as the entire field of legislation is occupied by the Parliament in view of Sections 9, 9A. 13, 18 and 25 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act, 1957 and the declaration contained in Section 2 therein.	Arguments of Respondent
Once it is held that the field is covered by the act of Parliament the guidlines for determining the constitutionality of the State Acts not only should be considered with reference to the Parliamentary Act and the rules frame thereunder but also upon taking into account, matters and aspects which can be legitimately brought within the purview of the legislative competence of the State.(v) As imposition of tax will have a bearing on mineral rights, the Parliament in its wisdom has taken over the entire control thereover.	Arguments of Respondent
Whether royalty is a tax on minerals is not an issue although there is substantial authority for the proposition that the royalty would be a tax.	Arguments of Respondent
The Parliament can impose tax not only under Entry 54 but also in terms of Entry 97 of List I. When an entry is made subject to another entry the same would mean that out of the scope of the former entry a field of legislation covered by the later entry has been reserved to be dealt by the appropriate legislature.(vi)	Arguments of Respondent
Tax on land and buildings can be imposed on land as unit and not on the basis of product thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
The impugned tax is on activity of land and as all relevant provisions are required to be taken into account and the essential substance thereof it required to be ascertained for determining the true nature of the impugned legislation, and thus, the standard on which the tax is levied is a relevant consideration for determining the nature thereof.	Arguments of Respondent
Re Tea Matters24.	None
the submissions of Mr. V.R. Reddy, learned Senior Counsel are(i) Even if it be held that the legislative fields of the State List and the Union List overlap, applying the doctrine of pith and substance and having regard to the history of legislation, Entry 49 must be held to be applicable in these matters.(ii)	Arguments of Petitioner
The State has a wide discretion in the matter of taxation.(iii) for the purpose of interpreting the respective legislative fields of the Union and State Lists, comparence of the State legislative must be seen first so as to enable the Courts to find out as to whether it falls within the residuary power of the Parliament or not.(iv) The States power to impose tax must be considered having regard to the economic activities of the State.25.

Mr. Reddy would urged that the principles emerging from the said decision are that (i) what is relevant is the use of the land and annual value of the property and not the real value of the property (ii) the yield income, actual or potential productivity would be relevant factors (iii) the subject of a tax is different from the measure thereof.26.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was point out that the municipal law relating to property tax would also be relatable to Entry 49, List II and this Court in relation thereto has held that actual value may be a relevant consideration.27.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the learned counsel green tea leaf is not a marketable commodity and in that view of the matter, it cannot be said that there exists a competing entry for levy of excise duty thereupon in terms of the provisions of the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 and, thus, the State must be held to have the legislative competence to impose the impugned tax.	Arguments of Petitioner
Strong reliance, in this connection, has been placed on Union Carbide India Limited vs. Union of India and Others (1986) 2 SCC 547 and Ralla Rams case (supra).28.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel would submit that despite Entry 52, List I, this Court has held that thereby the other taxing powers of the State have not been taken away.29.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel appearing on behalf of Writ petitioners, on the other hand, submitted(i) The Parliament in its wisdom has taken over the control of entire tea industry including the manner and extent of cultivation, regulation of production, regulation of sale and export of tea, increasing the consumption in India and elsewhere in tea and propagandas to be made for that purpose as would appear from Sections 10, 13, 15, 25 and 30 thereof.(ii)	Arguments of Respondent
Although agriculture is a State subject, the Tea Act having been enacted by the Parliament in terms of Article 253 of the Constitution, the State of West Bengal was denuded of its power to make any legislation whatsoever.(iii)	Arguments of Respondent
Having regard to the declaration made in Section 2 of the Tea Act, 1953, the entire tea industry having been taken over in terms of Entry 52 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the impugned legislation must be held to be bad in law.(iv)	Arguments of Respondent
The purported levy is not relatable to Entry 49, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India as in terms thereof the tax is required to be levied directly on the land as a unit.(v) The structure of the levy clearly indicates that it is directly on production.(vi)	Arguments of Respondent
Whereas a small tea estate employing modern cultivation techniques may produce a larger quantity of tea leaves and, thus, are required to pay a higher amount of tax but a larger estate employing primitive methods and thus producing smaller quantity of tea leaves would pay less amount of cess.(vii)	Arguments of Respondent
Furthermore, the quality of tea leaves varies from place to place and depend upon the quality and characteristics of the land.(viii)	Arguments of Respondent
As by reason of the impugned Act, a uniform cess on quantity of tea leaves without regard to the quality, quantity or productivity of land has been levied, the same is illegal.(ix)	Arguments of Respondent
Imposition of tax at a flat rate, it was urged, has nothing to do with the potential productivity and thus the same is ultra vires Article 4 of the Constitution of India.(x)	Arguments of Respondent
If measures of the tax is not in tune with reference to the value or potential productivity, the same would be a pointer to the conclusion that the legislative intent was not to impose tax on land but on the production of tea.	Arguments of Respondent
Brick Earth and Minor Mineral Matters The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Brick Earth matters and Minor Mineral matters would contend that although the State has the requisite power to make rules in relation to minor minerals in terms of Section 15 of the 1957 Act.	None
but as the entire field is covered, no cess can be levied by the State Government purported to be in exercise of its power under Entry 5 of List II of the Constitution of India.	None
Issue The core issue with which this Court is concerned is as to whether the legislative competence of the State to impose cess is traceable to Entries 49 and 50 of List II visavis Entries 52, 54 read with Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None

M.R.D. Act, 1957  Purport and object While enacting the 1957 Act, it was stated Amending Act 15 of 1958In view of its importance as basic fuel and the position it occupies in the countrys economy, coal has always been treated differently from other minerals.	None
It is in recognition of this that no rules have been framed so far under Section 7 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948, in regard to modification of the terms and conditions of mining leases for coal granted before the commencement of that Act, though other minerals have been covered.	None
The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 967 of 1957), which replaces the Act of 1948, however, specifically extends the rate of royalty prescribed in the Second Schedule to mining leases granted before the 25th October, 1949, in respect of coal also and makes it obligatory for the other terms and conditions of such leases to be brought into conformity with the provisions of the Act and the rules made under sections 13 and 18.	None
It is considered that these changes will have numerous undesirable consequences.	None
The area covered by these mining leases are principally in West Bengal and Bihar and they account for as much as 80 per cent, of the total coal production in the country.	None
The royalties paid on these coal vary over a wide range but are generally much below the rate per ton prescribed in the Second schedule.	None
A sudden and uniform increase of these royalties is likely to have an unsettling effect on the industry and may retard the programme of coal production under the Second Five Year Plan.	None
The same adverse effect would be felt by sudden modification of the other terms and conditions.	None
The object of the present Bill is accordingly to exexpt mining leases for coal granted before the 25th October, 1949 from the operation of subsection (1) of section 9 and subsection (1) of section 16 of the Act, with powers to Government to extend these provisions to such leases at a future date subject to such exceptions and modifications as may be considered necessary.

Section 25 deals with recovery of rent, royalty, tax, fee or other sums due to the Government under the Act or the Rules framed thereunder which shall be a first charge on the assets and recovery as an arrear of land revenue and, thus, by necessary implication confers power to impose tax on the mineral.	None
Tea Act, 1953 The Tea Act was enacted by the Parliament indisputably in exercise of its legislative power contained in Entry 52, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
A requisite declaration to that effect also finds place in Section 2 of the Act.	None
The preamble of the Tea Act clearly points out that the same was enacted to provide for the control by the Union of the tea industry including the control, in pursuance of the International Agreement now in force, of the cultivation of tea in, and of the export of tea from, India and for the purpose of establishing a Tea Board and levy a duty of excise on tea produced in India.	None
The Statement of Objects and Reasons, the report of the Select Committee as also the various amendments made therein from time to time, particularly Amending Act 21 of 1967, Amending Act 22 of 1970, Amending Act 75 of 1976, Amending Act 38 of 1983 and Amending Act 24 of 1986 leave no manner of doubt that the tea industry had occupied a very important position in the country and in that view of the matter alone the Union Government took the industry under its control.	None
Cess has been defined in Section 3(c) to mean the duty of excise imposed by Section 25.	None
Owner has been defined in Section 3(k) in the following terms Owner with reference to a tea estate or garden or a subdivision thereof the possession of which has been transferred by lease, mortgage or otherwise, means the transferee so long as his right to possession subsists and with reference to a tea estate or a garden or a subdivision for which a agent is employed, means the agent if and in so far as, he has been duly authorised by the owner in that behalf We may further note the definition of tea as contained in Section 3(n) thereof with is in the following terms tea means the plant Camellia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze as well as all varieties of the product known commercially as tea made from the leaves of the plant Camellia Sinensis (L) of.	None
Kuntze including green tea is in pari materia with the State Act.	None
Chapter II of the Act provides for constitution of the Tea Board, Section 10 provides for the duties and functions of the Board which in no uncertain terms states that it shall be the duty of the Board to promote by such measures, as it thinks fit, the development under the control of the Central Government of the tea industry.	None
Subsection (2)(a) of Section 10 unlike other Act provides for regulation of production and extent of cultivation of tea.	None
The Board has, inter alia, a duty to regulate the sale and export of tea increasing the consumption in India and elsewhere of tea and carrying on propaganda for that purpose and improving the marketing of tea in India and elsewhere.	None
The Board in terms of subsection (3) of Section 10 is enjoined with a duty to act in accordance with and subject to such rules as may be made by the Central Government.	None
Chapter III provides for control over the extension of tea cultivation.	None
Section 12 prohibits planting of tea on any land unless permission therefor is granted by the Board.	None
Section 13 provides for the limitations to the extension of tea cultivation.	None

Section 16 empowers the owner of a tea estate to establish tea nurseries but even for that purpose all areas of land utilized therefor shall be excluded when computing for the purpose of Section 13 the total area of land in respect of which the permissions referred to in Section1 2 may be granted.	None
Chapter IIIA which was inserted by Act No. 75 of 1976 provides for management or control of tea undertakings or tea units by the Central Government in certain circumstances specified therefor.	None
Management of such tea undertakings or tea units can be taken over in the event any exigency situation as referred to therein comes into being.	None
The definition of tea unit as contained in Chapter IIIA is also a pointer to the fact that a tea unit would mean a tea estate or garden.	None
Chapter IV provides for control over the export of tea and tea seed.	None
Chapter V of the said Act deals with finance, accounts and audit.	None
Section 25 of the Act has undergone a substantial amendment by reason of Amending Act 24 of 1986, the Statement of Objects and Reasons whereof reads thus Amending Act 24 of 1986 Under section 25 of the Tea Act, 1953 (29 of 1953), the Central Government is empowered to levy and collect as a cess, a duty of excise on all tea produced in India at the rate of four paise per kilogram.	Reasoning
The Central Government is, however, empowered to fix a higher rate of cess not exceeding 8.8 paise per kilogram.	None
The present rate of cess of eight paise per kilogram was made effective from August, 1978.	None
Although, this rate is almost at the maximum rate allowed under the Act, the amount of cess collected has become insufficient to meet the expenditure of the various developmental and other activities of the Tea Board.	None
The gap between the proceeds from the cess and the actual expenditure of the Tea Board is likely to when further in view of the higher level of expenditure envisaged in the Seventh Plan.	None
The ceiling of 8.8 paise per kilogram, therefor, needs to be revised.	None
It is accordingly, proposed to amend section 25 of the Act for providing higher ceiling of levy of cess at a rate not exceeding fifty paise per kilogram as the Central Government may, from time to time, fix by notification.	None
It is also proposed to empower the Central Government to fix different rates for different varieties and grades of tea having regard to the geographical, climatic and other circumstances relating to the production of the different varieties and grades of tea.	None
The said provision, therefore, enables the Central Government to provide for imposition of cess on tea produced in India.	None
Subsection (1) of Section 25 provides that there shall be levied and collected as a cess for the proposes of this Act a duty of excise on all tea produced in India at the rate of four paise per kilogram.	Reasoning
Section 30 of the Act occurring in Chapter VI of the Act sepcifies the area of control taken over by the Central Government.	None
It reads thus Power to control price and distribution of tea or tea waste The Central Government may, by order notified in the Official Gazette, fix in respect of tea of any description specified therein The maximum price or the minimum price or the maximum and minimum prices which may be charged by a grower of tea. manufacturer or dealer, wholesale or retail, whether for the Indian market or for export (b) the maximum quantity which my in one transaction by sold to any person.	None
Any such order may for reasons to be specified therein (a) fix prices for such tea differently in different localities for different classes of dealers, or for growers of tea or manufacturers (b) instead of specifying the price or price to be charged, direct that price or prices shall be computed in such manner and by reference to such matters as may be provided by the order.	None
The Central Government may, by general or special order (a) prohibit the disposal of tea or tea waste except in such circumstances and under such conditions as may be specified in the order (b) direct any person growing, manufacturing or holding in stock tea of tea waste to sell the whole or a part of such tea or tea waste so grown or manufactured during any specified period, or to sell the whole or a part of the tea or tea waste so held in scock, to such person or class of persons and in such circumstances as may be specified in the order (c) regulate by licences, permits or otherwise the production, storage, transport or distribution of tea or tea waste.	None
Where in pursuance of any order made with reference to clause (b) of subsection (3), any person sells the whole or a part of any quantity of tea or tea waste, there shall be paid to him as price therefor (a) where the price can be fixed by agreement consistently with the order, if any, relating to the fixation of price issued under subsection (1), the price to agreed upon (b) where no such agreement can be reached, the price calculated with reference to any such order as is referred to in clause (a) (c) where neither clause (a) nor clause (b) applies, the price calculated at the market rate prevailing in the locality at the date of sale.	None
Without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred by subsection (1) and (3), any order made thereunder may provide (a) for requiring persons engaged in the production, supply or distribution of, or trade and commerce in, tea or tea waste to maintain and produce for inspection such books, accounts and records relating to their business and to furnish such information relating thereto as may be specified in the order (b) for such other matters, including in particular the entering the search of premises, vehicles, vessels and aircraft, the seizure by a person authorized to make such search, of tea or tea waste in respect of which such person has reason to believe that a contravention of the order has been, is being or is about to be committed, the grant or issue of licences, permits or other documents and the charging of fees therefor.	None
The Central Government in exercise of its power conferred upon it under Section 30 of the Tea Act made an order known as Tea (Marketing) Control Order 2003 in terms whereof different types of tea had been brought within the interpretation clause.	None
Clause 2(q) of the Order defines Bought leaf tea factory as follows 2(q)	None
Bought leaf tea factory means a tea factory which sources not less than twothirds of its tea leaf requirement from other tea growers during any calendar year for the purpose of manufacture of tea.	None
Federalism Federalism is one of the basic pillars of the Indian Constitution.	Reasoning
The federal distribution of powers are one of its unique features.	None
Having regard to Articles 245, 248, 250, 256, 257 356 and Entry 97 in list I of the VII Schedule of the Constitution, it is not possible to say that India is not a subscriber to federalism but although having unique federal character it can be said to be quasifederal or hybrid federal State.	None
Constitution courts have interpreted that India has a federal polity.	None
Each State has independent constitutional existence assigned with important political role.	None
Having regard to the aforementioned principles in mind, the CenterState relations as regards the distribution of legislative power must be viewed.	None
We may notice that Livingston in his treatise Federation and Constitution Change, 1956, pp. 67 has observed that federation is a more functional than institutional concept and it is wrong to suppose that there are certain inflexible features in the absence of which a political system cannot be federal stating Such a set of criteria ignores the fundamental fact that institutions are not the same things in different social and cultural environments	None
No two societies are the same and each will require very different instrumentalities in accordance with the complex of psychological and sociological determinants that is peculiar to it.	None
It is not in dispute that the founding fathers intended to create strong Centre having regard to the historic background.	None
Such a tilt in favour of the Centre as regard distribution of legislative field was felt to be a matter of necessity and that is precisely the reason why more important heads of legislation are in the Union List.	None
Even the residuary power has been conferred upon the Parliament.	None
The amendments made in the Constitution whereby and whereunder a few entries in List II which were either omitted or transferred to other lists also is a pointer to the said fact.	None

2d 248, it is stated We have, then, a case where the federal regulatory scheme is comprehensive, pervasive, and without a hiatus which the state regulations could fill.	None
Both the subject matter and the statute call for uniformity.	None
The conflict is substantialat least fix out of every 100 federally certified avocados are barred for failure to pass the California test  and it is located in a central portion of the federal scheme.	None
The effect of the conflict is to disrupt and burden the flow of commerce and the sale of Florida avocados in distance markets, contrary to the congressional policy underlying the Act.	None
The State may have a legitimate economic interest in the subject matter, but it is adequately served by the federal regulations and this interest would be but slightly impaired, if at all, by the suppression of 792.	None
As would be discussed hereinafter in detail, the same principle would apply in the instant case.	None
Latham, C.J. in The State of South Australia and Another Vs.	None
the Commonwealth and Another, (1942) 65 C.L.R. 373 explained the legalistic feature stating The problem for the Court is a legal problem which is unknown in countries with a unitary form of government and a supreme legislature.	None
It arises only when legislative powers of a lawmaking agency are limited.	None
This is the case in Australia.	None
If either the Commonwealth Parliament or a State Parliament attempts to make a law which is not within its powers, the attempt fails, because it alleged law is unauthorized and is not a law at all The law is not valid until a court pronounces against it If it is beyond power.	None
It is invalid ab initio.	None
Thus the controversy before the Court is a legal controversy, not a political controversy It has been argued that the Acts now in question discriminate, in breach of s. 51(ii) of the Constitution, between States.	None
The Court must consider and deal with such a legal contention.	None
But the Court is not authorised to consider whether the Acts are fair and just as between States These are arguments to be used in Parliament and before the people.	None
They raise questions of policy which it is not for the Court to determine or even to consider.	None

Durga Das Basu in his celebated work Comparative Federalism at pp.	None
175176 states The strong Central bias has indeed been a boon to keep India together when we find the separatist forces of communalism, linguism and scramble for power playing havoc notwithstanding all the devices of Central control, even after more than three decades of the working of the Constitution.	None
It also shows that the States are not really functioning as agents of the Union Government of under the directions of the latter, for then, events like those in Assam (over the language problem) or in Punjab (pp. 115ff., ante) could not have taken place at all.	None
But, by reason of such centralizing trends.	None
federalism cannot be said to be dead in India.	None
A radical change in the background has taken place since 1967.	None
So long as the Union and all the States in India were under the rule of oneParty under the strong leadership of a growing personality such as Pandit Jawahar Lal or Mrs. Gandhi, there could hardly arise any tussle between the Union and the States which could not be settled by the Party leadership at Delhi, and, thus, Indian federalismcame to work almost as a unitary system.	None
But in 1967, different parties came to power in a number of States, so that they would naturally refuse to act as dictated by the Party in power at Delhi.	None
The frequent resort to the extraordinary power under Art.	None
356 to keep recalcitrant State politics under Union control, the abuse of Governors powers in some cases, and the like, have accelerated the forces of separatism.	None
In such a situation, which is prevailing till the time of this writing in 1986, the question of State powers under the provisions of the existing Constitution, as well as the question of their revision by amendment of the Constitution, are bound to raise their head and agitations over these questions have led to the constitution of the Sarkaria Commission (1983) to examine and revise, if necessary, the Centre State relations under the Constitution.	None
In the said treatise at page 178 quoting Dicey, Law of the Constitution, 10th Ed.	None
p. 164, the learned author states There are, according to Dicey, three essential legal features in a federal Constitution, namely, Supremacy of a written Constitution Distribution of powers amongst the various organs of the federation and of the regional units of the federation, by the provisions of that Constitution and Judicial review or enforcement of that supreme Constitution as law.	None
If these legal features are present in the Indian Constitution, it would be immaterial to a lawyer whether academicians would classify it at quas of a unitary constitution which subsidiary federal teatures, of the like.	None
In his book, Central power in the Australian Commonwealth, Cassell, London.	None
Sir Robert Menzies states My central purpose has been to demonstrate a great truth about the study of a federal Constitution.	None
That truth is that although it is a sound rule by go back to the language of the constitution  melius est petere fonts quam sectar rivulos  it is a mistake to think that a Constitution is something rigid and inflexible, to be interpreted like any ordinary statute, to have a meaning fixed for all time, I have defended legalism as something inherent in federalism.	None
But it is not inconsistent with the legalistic approach to recognize that a written Constitution is an expressed scheme of government designed to give a basic structure in a changing world not designed to inhibit growth in a growing world.	None
nor to make the contemporary world subject to the political, social or economic ideas of a bygone age.	None
The doctrine or federalism in the Indian context would mean proper and effective interpretation of the Constitution in respect whereof political or economic views have no role to play.	None
Fields of legislation carved out under Chapter I of Part XI clearly spells out that in more important matter and the Parliament will have greater control thereover.	None
Tilt in favour of the Central is required to be construed having regard to the importance of the subject matter of Parliamentary legislation and the impact and practical effect of the in road of the State Laws entrenching upon the legislative field occupied by the Parliament.	None
It would, therefore, not be correct for the superior courts to advocate the theory that while interpreting the Constitution, courts should lean in favour of the State.	None
Federal character of the Union of States in India do not support the said theory.	None
Legislative Field	None
The principles required to be deduced as regard field of legislation, may not be much in dispute.	None
The question, however, it that of its application.	None
Before analyzing the relevant provisions, we may have an overview of the constitutional scheme in this behalf.	None
Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution of India read with Seventh Schedule and Legislative Lists contained therein prescribe the extent of legislative competence of Parliament and State Legislatures.	None
Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect of any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule.	None
Similarly, State Legislatures have exclusive power to make laws in respect of any of the matters enumerated in List II.	None
Parliament and State Legislatures both have legislative power to make laws with respect to any matter enumerated in List III, the Concurrent List.	None
The various entries in the three Lists are fields of legislation.	None
They are designed to define and delimit the respective areas of legislative competence of the Union and State Legislatures.	None
Since legislative subjects cannot always be divided into water tight compartments some overlappings between List I, II and III of the Seventh Schedule is inevitable.	None
Hence, though the State Legislature has exclusive power with respect to the subjects specified in List II, some of the Entries in List II specifically make the State power subject to any law made by Parliament under the specified Entry in List I. Article 245 of the Constitution of India empowers the Parliament not only to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India but also indicate that no law made by the Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have extraterritorial operation.	None
Clause (1) of Article 246 of the Constitution of India confers exclusive legislative power upon the Parliament with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule whereas in terms of clause (2) thereof, the Legislature of any State also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule, subject of course to the legislative competence of the Parliament as contained in clause (3) thereof.	Reasoning
The power of the State Legislature in terms of clause (3) of Article 246 is subject to clauses (1) and (2) in relation to the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule.	None
In Union and State relations under the Indian Constitution by M.C. Setalvad, upon noticing the expressions used in different clauses of Article 246, it is stated In the United States and in Canada, judicial decisions have established that, where a federal law or a dominion law conflicts with a State law on the same subject, the relevant federal or dominion law must prevail.	None
The same position has been achieved by an express provision in section 109 of the Commonwealth of Australia Act.	None
In the Indian Constitution, this is sought to be achieved in part by the language of Article 246.	None
The purpose of the provisions which we have set out in Article 246(1), (2) and (3), is clearly to carve out not only two exclusive legislative fields for the Union and the States and a further field in which both the general and the regional governments can operate, but also to provide by the language used in each of three clauses of the Article that the legislative power of the Union in List I is predominant.	None
That power is exercisable notwithstanding anything in clauses (2) and (3) of Article 246.	None
The concurrent Union power of legislation conferred by clause (2) of Article 246 is exercisable notwithstanding anything in clause (3) which deals with the exclusive legislative power of the State.	None
But the States concurrent legislative power is subject to clause (1), which deals with the exclusive Union power of legislation.	None
The States legislative power in the field carved out for it by List II is again exercisable subject to clauses (1) and (2), which deal with the Union power and the Concurrent power, the first vested exclusively in the Union and the second in both the Union and the State, Emphasis supplied The Construction makers found the need for power sharing devices between the Central and the State having regard to the imperatives of the States security and stability and, thus, propelled the thrust towards centralisation by using non obstants clause under article 246 so as to see that the federal supremacy is achieved.	None
A perusal of the provisions of entries in List II would show that there are 17 entries in List II (Entries 1, 2, 12, 13, 17, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 32,33, 37, 50 54, 57 64) which are one way or the other subject to either provisions of Entries in List I and or List III or subject to laws made by Parliament.	None
There are four models of entries to that effect.	None
Eight Entries (2, 13, 17, 22, 23, 24, 33, 54) out of the aforesaid 17 entries have been made subject to the provisions of Entries in List I. Three Entries (26, 27, 57) have been made subject to provisions of Entries in List III.	None
Four Entries (1, 12, 32, 63) out of the aforesaid 17 entries have been given power to the State Legislatures to make laws on subjects other than those specified in List I and or dealt with by law mae by Parliament.	None
Only two Entries (27 50) have been made subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List of the State List.	None
Article 253 of the Constitution of India reads thus Legislation for giving effect to international agreements  Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter, Parliament has power to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body.	None
It can be seen that Art.	None
253 contains nonobstante clause.	None
Art.	None
253, thus, operates notwithstanding anything contained in Art.	None
245 and Art.	None
246.	None
Art.	None
246 confers power on the Parliament to enact laws with respect to matters enumerated in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.	None
Entries 10 to 21 of List I of the Seventh Schedule pertain to International Law.	None
In making any law under any of these entries, parliament is required to keep Art.	None
51 in mind.	None
Article 253 of Constitution provides that while giving effect to an international treaty, the Parliament assumes the role of the State Legislature and once the same is done the power of the State is denuded.	None
Notwithstanding the fact that great care with which the various entries in the three lists have been framed on some rare occasions it may be found that one or the other field is not covered by these entries.	None
The makers for our Constitution have, in such a case, take care by conferring power to legislate on such residuary subjects upon the Union Parliament including taxation by reason of Article 248 of the Constitution.	None
We may notice that in the Government of India Act, 1935 no provision of the nature of Entry 97 in List I existed.	None
In terms of Section 104 thereof the Governor General could empower either the Dominion Legislature or a Provincial Legislature to enact a law with respect to any matter not enumerated in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Act, including a law imposing a tax not mentioned in any such list and the executive authority of the Dominion or of the Province, as the case may be, shall extend to the administration of any law so made, unless the Governor General otherwise directs.	None
In Constitution of India however, such a residuary power has expressly been conferred on the Parliament.	None
Once it is held that the State lacks legislative competence for imposition of tax on any of the subject, indisputably the Parliament alone will have legislative competence therefor.	None
Case Laws Re Legislative Competence Observation made by this Court in S.R. Choudhuri v. State of Punjab, (2001) 7 SCC 126 , in this regard, is apposite Constitutional provisions are required to be understood and interpreted with an objectoriented approach.	None
A Constitution must not be construed in a narrow and pedantic sense.	None
The words used may be general in terms but, their full import and true meaning, has to be appreciated considering the true context in which the same are used and the purpose which they seek to achieve.	None
In Attorney General for India Vs. Amratal Prajivandas, (1994) 5 SCC 54 , the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976 (SAFEMA) made by Parliament was challenged inter alia as lacking legislative competence.	None
The Constitution Bench of nineJudges relying on Union of India Vs.	None
Shri Harbhajan Singh Dhillon (1971) 2 SCC 779 observed as under Be that as it may, it is not necessary to pursue this line of reasoning since we are in total agreement with the approach evolved in Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon  a decision by a Constitution bench of seven Judges.	None
The test evolved in the said decision is this in short Where the legislative competence of Parliament to enact a particular statute is questioned, one must look at the several entries in List II to find out (applying the well known principles in this behalf) whether the said statute is relatable to any of those entries.	None
If the statute does not relate to any of the entries in List II, no further inquiry is necessary.	None
It must be held that Parliament is competent to enact that statute whether by virtue of the entries in List I and List III or by virtue of Article 248 read with Entry 97 of List I.	None
We may at this juncture also notice the decision of this Court in Naga Peoples Movement of Human Rights Vs. Union of India, AIR 1998 SC 431 which states While examining the legislative competence of Parliament to make a law what is required to be seen is whether the subjectmatter falls in the State List which Parliament cannot enter.	None
If the law does not fall in the State List, Parliament would have legislative competence to pass the law by virtue of the residuary powers under Article 248 read with Entry 97 of the Union List and it would not be necessary to go into the question whether it falls under any entry in the Union List or the Concurrent List.	None
See Union of India v. H.S. Dhillon, (1972) 2	None

What is, therefore, required to be examined is whether the subjectmatter of the Central Act falls in any of the entries in the State List.	None
Yet again in Synthetic Chemicals Ltd. vs. State of U.P. AIR 1990 SC 1927 , it has been held It has also to be borne in mind that where division of powers and jurisdiction in a federal Constitution is the scheme, it is desirable to read the Constitution in harmonious way.	None
In State of A.P. Vs. K. Purushotham Reddy Ors. reported in JT 2003 (3) SC 15 , it was held the conflict in legislative competence of the Parliament and the State Legislatures having regard to Article 246 of the Constitution of India must be viewed in the light of the decisions of this Court which in no uncertain terms state that each Entry has to be interpreted in a broad manner.	None
Both the parliamentary legislation as also the State legislation must be considered in such a manner so as to uphold both of them and only in case where it is found that both cannot coexist, the State Act may be declared ultra vires In India Cement.	None
(supra), it is stated It is well settled that widest amplitude should be given to the language of these entries, but some of these entries in different lists or in the same list may overlap and sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict with each other.	None
Then, it is the duty of the court to find out its true intent and purpose and to examine a particular legislation in its pith and substance to determine whether it fits in one or the other of the lists.	None
In Bharat Coking Coal Vs. State of Bihar (1990 4 SCR 557, it has been held No doubt under Entry 23 of List II, the State legislature has power to make law but that power is subject to Entry 54 of List I with respect to the regulation and development of mines and minerals.	None
As discussed earlier the State legislature is denuded of power to make laws on the subject in view of Entry 54 of List I and the Parliamentary declaration made under S. 2 of the Act.	None
The decisions of this Court, therefore, also lead to the conclusion that in case the State for one reason or the other lacks legislative competence, the court must proceed on the basis that Parliament alone has the legislative competence and it would not be permissible to uphold the State Act by leaning in favour of the State or by giving a broader meaning to the entry in List II relating to the subject matter of legislation.	None
Pith and Substance Doctrine of pith and substance, however, is taken recourse to when examining the constitutionality of an Act with respect to competing legislative competence of the Parliament and the State Legislature qua the subject matter.	None
Incidental entrenchment however is permissible.	None
In D.C. G.M. Co. Ltd.	None
Vs. Union of India.	None
AIR 1983 SC 937 , it has been held When a law is impugned on the ground that it is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it, what has to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation.	None
To do that one must have regard to the enactment as a whole, to its objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions.	Reasoning
to resolve the controversy if it becomes necessary to ascertain to which entry in the three Lists, the legislation is referable, the court has evolved the doctrine of pith and substance.	None
If in pith and substance, the legislation falls within one entry or the other but some portion of the subjectmatter of the legislation incidentally trenches upon the might enter a field under another List, then it must be held to be valid in its entirely, even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are beyond its competence.

State of U.P. AIR 1980 SC 1955 , it was held When validity of a legislation is challenged on the ground of want of legislative competence and it becomes necessary to ascertain to which entry in the three lists the legislation is referable to, the court has evolved the theory of pith and substance.	None
If in pith and substance a legislation falls within one entry or the other but some portion of the subjectmatter of the legislation incidentally trenches upon and might enter a field under another list, the Act as a whole would be valid notwithstanding such incidental trenching.	None
The question which, therefore, is required to be posed and answered is as to whether both the Acts can stand together or not.	None
While determining the question as to whether there exists any conflict, the real test would be as to whether both the legislations covering the field can stand together.	None
for the purpose of determination thereof, it may be necessary to look to the legislative history as also the decision of this Court.	None
In Kartar Singh Vs.	None
State of Punjab, (1994) (3) scc 569 this Court held In order to ascertain the pith and substance of the impugned enactments, the preamble, Statement of Objects and Reasons, the legal significance and the intendment of the provisions of these Acts, their scope and the nexus with the object that these Acts seek to subserve must be objectively examined in the background of the totality of the series of events Ascertainment of pith and substance of synonymous to ascertainment of true nature and character of the legislative competence necessitated for the purpose of determining whether it is a legislation with respect of one of the matters of the list.

Analysis Re Legislative Field In the economic front, the country has to compete with the developed countries.	None
Global competition has reached such a stage that despite adequate production of coal and steel, the same are imported from other countries in India.	None
In the international markets also the question of import is going up as compared to export.	None
The manner in which the revenue is collected by the Centre and distributed to States falls for consideration by the appropriate constitutional authorities in terms of the provisions of the Constitution.	None
It is not correct to say that while interpreting the legislative field the country in case of conflict would lean in favour of the State keeping in view the fact that taxes under different heads are collected by the Centre and a part of revenue is made available to the States from time to time.	None
This Court is not concerned as to whether the Centre consumes the lions share of revenue or the same is subject matter of criticism at the hands of the State of financial observers.	None
Such an approach would not only run counter to the doctrine of federalism with a strong Centre but in the long run would prove to be counterproductive.	None
India is a signatory to various international treaties and covenants and being a party to WTO and GATT, it is obligated to fulfill its transnational obligations.	None
If for the purpose of giving effect to the international treaties, it in exercise of its power under Article 253 of the Constitution of India had taken over the legislative field occupied by List II of the Seventh schedule of the Constitution, no exception thereto can be taken.	None
While doing so, the Central Government shall give effect to the will of the makers of the Constitution and would not act contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith.	None
The legislative fields of the Union and the State very from country to country depending upon the requirement of the situation in which such provisions are made.	None
Although a lot can be said on the subject, keeping in view the fact that our job is confined to interpretation of the legislative entries visavis the Parliamentary and Legislative Acts, it may not be necessary to do so.	None
But suffice however it to point out that when such an approach is adopted, we would be more prone to committing errors.	None
We must proceed on the basis that neither the Union nor the State is supreme on the Constitution, as both the Union and the State will have to trace their power from the provisions of the Constitution.	None
We should treat the subject with caution and circumspection.	None
The interpretive principles whether learning in favour of the Union or the State may, in certain situations, depend upon the subject matter of legislation, the importance thereof and its effect and impact within the outside the country.	None
Both mineral and tea deserve more control only by the Union having regard to their importance in national economy.	None

Distribution of taxes by the Central Government in favour of the State Government is of no moment in the instant cases as the entire royalty fixed by the Central Government in terms of the 1957 Act is payable to the States.	None
The Union government has nothing to do therewith.	None
If the Constitution as a living organ is not interpreted having regard to the intention of the constitution makers and in case of conflict in the legislative field contained in List I and List II, if an interpretation that leans in the favour of the State is adopted without reference to the subject matter thereof of national interest, the some would be subject to judicial vagaries which cannot be countenanced.	None
The impairment of States economic interest is of no moment even if Parliament had taken over the entire legislative field by enacting Acts in terms of Entry 52 of 54 of List I. As noticed by Brother Lohoti, J in South Eastarn Coalfields Limited Vs.	None

They are getting enhance royalty but despite India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra) the State of West Bengal alone amended the impugned acts and had been insisting that it can lay cess on minerals.	None
It may not be necessary for us to delve deep into the matter as to whether there exists a distinction between a general subject of legislation and taxation has such a question does not directly arise for consideration.	None
It may only be of some academic interest.	None
It is, however, trite that there is nothing in the Constitution to debar the Parliament to legislate under Entry 54 read with Entry 97 of the List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.	None
However, recourse to the residuary power must be taken as a last resort i.e. only when all the entries in the three lists are absolutely exhousted, that is to say, if the subject matter is beyond comprehension of the entries contained in the aforementioned three lists.	None
It is trite that when two interpretations are possible resort to the residuary power may not be taken recourse to.	None
But it is also trite that the entries have to be given a liberal construction irrespective of the fact that as to whether they are in List I or List II.	None
See South Eastern Coalfields (supra).	None
There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that for the said purpose, the main object as also the scope and purport of the Central legislation visavis the State legislation must be kept in mind and, thus, there cannot by any question of examining the same with joundiced eyes.	None
With the greatest respect, in Indian context it is difficult to follow Morey Vs. Doud (1957) 354 US 457 wherein Frankfurter, J. says The Courts have only the power to destroy, not to reconstruct.	None
The Courts in India generally leans in favour of upholding the constitutionality of the statute whether enacted by the State Legislature or the Parliament.	None
In this context, reference may be made to the decisions of this Court in Indian Handicraft Emporium Vs. Union of India (2003) 7 SCC 589 and Balram Kumawat Vs. Union of India (2003) 7 SCC 628 , wherein vires of Wild Life Protection Act has been upheld by applying the principles of Purposive Construction.	None
It is relevant to note that in R.K. Garg Vs. Union of India AIR 1981 SC 2138 in which reference of Morey (supra) has been made while judging the constitutionality of Special Bearer Bonds (immunities and Exemptions) Ordinance, this Court rejected the argument that the said ordinance is immoral stating It was then contended that the Act is unconstitutional as it offends against morality by according to dishonest assessee who have evaded payment of tax,immunities and exemptions which are denied to honest taxpayers.	None
Those who have broken the law and deprived the State of its legitimate dues fare given benefits and concessions placing them at an advantage over those who have observed the law and paid the taxes due from them and this, according to the petitioners, is clearly immoral and unwarranted by the Constitution.	None
We do not think this contention can be sustained.	None
It is necessary to remember that we are concerned here only with the constitutional validity of the Act and not with its morality.	None
It is, however, wellsettled that although both the Union and the State derive their power from the same Constitution, the States would not have any legal right as against the overriding powers of the Union, because of a general theory of paramountcy or superiority of the Union.	None
The Union can claim overriding powers or superior powers over the State in certain situation because the Constitution itself provides therefor.	None

Entries 52 and 54 of List	None
I It may be that the interpretation of the legislative fields of the State List and Union List should be construed in deference to the extent of declaration made by the Parliament in terms of Entry 52 List I of the Constitution of India.	None
It may also be true that ordinarily the declaration contained in Section 2 of the Act in regard to this requirement as contemplated in Entries 52 and 54 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India would not affect the legislative competence of the State in relation to raw material.	None
Although a liberal construction of a State Entry is desirable but at the same time the Court should guard against extending the meaning of the word beyond a reasonable limit.	None
In Kerala State Electricity Board Vs. Indian Aluminium Co. (1976 (1) SCC 468, it was held that the entire field of Electricity as contemplated under Entry 38 of List III is covered under Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948.	None

(1969) 2 SCC 166 this Court gave a broad meaning to Entry 52 holding that even preparation of gold ornaments would come within the purview of Entry 52 stating But this contention was not accepted.	None
It was contended by Mr. Daphtary that it the process of production was to constitute industry, a process of machinery of mechanical contrivance was essential.	None
But we see no reason why such a limitation should be imposed on the meaning of the word industry in the legislative lists.	None
Similarly it was argued by Mr. Palkhivala that the manufacture of gold ornaments was not an industry because it required application of individual art and craftsmanship and aesthetic skill.	None
But mere use of skill or art is not a decisive factor and will not take the manufacture of gold ornaments out of the ambit of the relevant legislative entries.	None

State of T.N. and Others (1996) 5 SCC 670 , P.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. speaking for the Bench held The fifth contention of the learned counsel for the appellantspetitioners is equally misconceived.	None
Parliament has already denuded the State Legislatures of their power to levy tax on minerals inhering in them by making the declaration contained in Section 2 of the MMRD Act.	None
Shri Sanghi argued that the denudation is not absolute put only to the extent provided in the MMRD Act.	None
Section 9, learned counsel submitted, is one of the facets of the extent of denudation.	None
Section 9, it is submitted, sets out the rates of royalty levied and also states that such rates of royalty can be revised only once in three years.	None
If Section 9 is sought to be amended, whether directly or indirectly, the learned counsel says, a fresh declaration in terms of Entry 54 of List I is called for.	None
This contention assumes that notwithstanding the declaration contained in Section 2 of the MMRD Act, the States still retain the power to lavy taxes upon minerals over and above those prescribed by the MMRD Act and that a fresh declaration is called for whenever such subsisting power of the State is sought to be further encroached upon.	None
This supposition, however, flies in the face of the decisions of this Court in India Cement (1990) 1 SCC 12 1989 Supp.	None
(1) SCR 692 and Orissa Cement 1991 Supp (1) SCC 430 (1991) 2 SCR105.	None
The said decisions are premised upon the assumption that by virtue of the declaration, the States are totally denuded of the power to levy any taxes on minerals.	None
It is for this reason that the State enactments were declared incompetent insofar as they purported to levy taxes cesses on minerals.	None
The denudation of the State is not partial.	None
It is total.	None
They cannot levy any tax or cess on minerals so long as the declaration in Section 2 stands.	None
Once the denudation is total, there is no occasion or necessity for any further declaration of denudation or, for that matter, for repeated declarations of denudation.	None
Emphasis supplied We are not oblivious of the fact that the said decision has been overruled by a threeJudge Bench in District Mining Officer and Others Vs.	None
Tata Iron and Steel Co. and Another (2001) 7 SCC 358 on a different question as therein the Court laid emphasis that Cess and Other Taxes on Minerals (Validation) Act, 1992 in so far as imposition and collection of cess on minerals extracted upto 4.4.1991 on which date the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Orissa Cement case (supra) was valid as thereby the Parliament by legal fiction injected legislative competence upto the laws enacted by the Legislature.

It was held that the Validation Act did not confer any right to make levy and collection of tax and minerals which was collectable after 4.4.1991.	None

The State of Uttar Pradesh Others (1956 SCR 393 ), the question which arose for consideration was as to whether there existed a repugnancy between the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act 1953 which was enacted in terms of Entry 33 of List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the notifications issued thereunder visavis the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, the Court referred to Nicholass Australian Constitution, 2nd Ed.	None
Page 303, in the following terms There may be inconsistence in the actual terms of the competing statutes (R. V. Brisbane Licensing Court, (1920 28 CLR 23).	None
Though there may be no direct conflict, a State law may be inoperative because the Commonwealth law, or the award of the Commonwealth Court, is intended to be complete exhaustive code (Clyde Engineering Co. Ltd. V. Cowburn, (1926)	None
37 C.L.R. 466).	None
Even in the absence of intention, a conflict may arise when both State and Commonwealth seek to exercise their powers over the same subject matter (Victoria V. Commonwealth, (1937)	None
58 C.L.R. 618 Wenn V. AttorneyGeneral (Vict.), (1948) 77 C.L.R. 84).	None
Isaacs, J. In Clyde Engineering Company Limited V. Cowburn laid down one test of inconsistency as conclusive If, however, a competent legislature expressly or implicitly evinces its intention to cover the whole field, that is a conclusive test of inconsistence where another Legislature assumes to enter to any extent upon the same field.	None
Applying the said tests, the Court upheld the validity of the said Act only on the ground that although rawmaterial sought to be regulated under the State Act would be essential in the process of manufacture of production of articles in the Scheduled industries but would not be of the same nature or description as the article or class of articles manufactured or produced thereunder.	None
It is in that context, this court considered the provisions of Section 18 G of the 1951 Act.	None
A distinction much be borne in mind as regard used of land and activities on land.	None
Use of land as a fair or market is permissible in terms of Entry 26 of List II.	None
Imposition of Tax, however, would be impermissible on activity of land as it does not come within the purview of any of the entries contained in List II.	None
Different considerations may arise as regard interpretation of different entries keeping in view the lists in which they belong.	None
The Court may have to look from a different angle in a case where it relates to interpretation of conflicting entries in List I visavis List II and List II visavis List II.	None
In a case where both the State Act and the Central Act have been enacted in terms of List III, the question of repugnancy as envisaged under Article 254 would arise.	None
In that type of cases, it is wellsettled that in absence of Presidential assent, the Parliamentary Act would prevail.	None

The situation may, however, be different where there is no apparent conflict between an entry in List II and one in List I.	None
As having compared the provisions of the two Acts, if it is possible to determine that the parameters of the State Legislation and the Central Legislation are distinct and different, a broader meaning to one Entry or the other may be given having regard to the pith and substance doctrine.	None

Sabharwal, J. Proceeded to uphold the market fee levied on tobacco on the basis that Parliament was not competent to pass legislation in respect of sale of agricultural produce of tobacco covered by Entry 52 of the Union List under which the Parliament can legislative only in respect of the industries, namely, the process of manufacture of production.	None
It was in that premise held that the activity regarding sale of raw tobacco as provided in the Tobacco Board Act would not be regarded as industry.	None
Ruma Pal J. in her concurrent judgment observed To sum up the word Industry for the purposes of Entry 52 of List I has been firmly confined by Tika Ramji to the process of manufacturer or production only.	None
Subsequent decisions including those of other Constitution Benches have reaffirmed that Tika Ramji case authoritatively defined the word industry  to mean the process of manufacture or production and that it does not include the raw materials used in the industry or the distribution of the products of the industry.	None
Given the constitutional framework, and the weight of judicial authority it is not possible to accept an argument canvassing a wider meaning of the word industry.	None
Whatever the word may mean in any other context, it must be understood in the Constitutional context as meaning manufacture or production.	None
Pattnaik, J., however, for himself and Bharucha, J. (as the learned Chief Justices then were) observed In view of the aforesaid rules of interpretation as well as the Constitution Bench decision referred to above, it is difficult for us to accept the contention of Mr. Dwivedi that the word industry in Entry 52 of List I should be given a restricted meaning, so as to exclude from its purview the subject of legislation coming within entry 27 or Entry 14 of List II.	None
Bearing in mind the constitutional schemd of supremacy of Parliament, the normal rule of interpretation of an Entry in any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the object of taking over the control of the tobacco industry by the Parliament, on making a declaration as required under Entry 52 of List I and on examining the different provisions of the Tobacco Board Act, we see no justification for giving a restricted meaning to the expression industry in Entry 52 of List I, nor do we find any justification in the contention of the counsel appearing for the States and also different Market Committees that the provisions contained in Tobacco Board Act dealing with the growing of tobacco as well as making provisions for sale and purchase of tobacco, must be held to be beyond the legislative competence of Parliament, as it does not come within the socalled narrow meaning of the expression industry on the ground that otherwise it would denude the State Legislature of its power to make law dealing with markets under Entry 28, dealing with agriculture under Entry 14 and dealing with goods under Entry 27 List II.	None
Such an approach of interpretation in our considered opinion would be against the very scheme of the constitution and supremacy of Parliament and such an approach towards interpreting the power sharing devices in relation to entries in List I and List II would be against the trust towards centralisation.	None
In our considered opinion, therefore, the word industry in Entry 52 of List I should not be given any restricted meaning and should be interpreted in a manner so as to enable the Parliament to make law in relation to the subject matter which is declared and whose control has been taken over to bring within its sweep any ancillary matter, which can be said to be reasonably included within the power and which may be incidental to the subject of legislation, so that Parliament would be able to make an effective law.	None
So constructed and on examining different provisions of the Tobacco Board Act, we do not find any lack of legislative competence with Parliament so as to enact any of the provisions contained in the said Act, the Act in question having been enacted by Parliament on a declaration being made of taking over of the control of the Tobacco industry by the Union and the Act being intended for the development of the said industry.

Its control covers from selection of seeds  to cultivation  to production  to green tea leaves  the processing of tea  to marketing both domestic and international.	None
No legislative field has been left untouched which can be entrenched upon by the State Legislature.	None
It is in the aforementioned backdrop the right of the State in terms of Entry 49 List II must be held to have been denuded.	None
Section 25 of the Act provides for imposition of cess on production of tea.	None
Production has a direct nexus with the activities of the Tea Board as enumerated under the Tea Act.	None
Imposition of levy of cess on production of tea in terms of Section 25 of the Act is over and above the power to impose excise duty under the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944.	None
Thus, to impose cess on production of tea is the field occupied by the Parliament.	None
We have no manner of doubt that Section 25 has been enacted specifically for the purpose of controlling the price of tea both for the purpose of its consumption within the outside the country.	None
The Stte, therefore, must be held to be denuded of its power to impose any tax on production of tea. 135.	None
it is furthermore wellsettled that for the purpose of determining the extent of the field occupied by a Parliamentary legislation, it is not necessary to find out as to whether any rule has been framed in terms of the provisions of the Act or not.	None

Once it is held that the Parliament has exercised its superior power which is conferred on it in terms of Article 248 of the Constitution of India, the question of levy of any tax on the product would not arise.	None
It is not a case where tax is imposed by the State in exercise of its power which has no direct nexus with Entry 52 of List I.	None

It is then the duty of this Court to reconcile the entries and bring about harmony between them.	None
The court should strive at searching for reasonable and practical construction to seek reconciliation and give effect to all of them.	None
It reconciliation proves impossible, the overriding power of the Union Legislature operates and prevails.	None
Even no extended meaning is given to the word tea both for the purpose of Tea Act and the impugned Acts, as green tea leaves would admittedly come within the purview thereof, having regard to the object and purport the Tea Act seeks to achieve, in any opinion, no tax can be imposed thereupon.	None
Keeping in view the constitutional scheme, the Entries 52 and 54 must be given liberal meaning visavis Entries 49 and 50 of List II having regard to importance of coal and tea which have an immediate and direct bearing in the economic development of the country.	None
What is required to be kept in mind in a situation of this nature is the object underlying the provisions of the 1953 Act and 1957 Act.	None
Once it is found that the object of the 1957 Act is to denude the State from enacting a statute and it will have a direct impact on regulation of mines and minerals development as also control of Tea industry, the Central Acts would be construed liberally visavis the State Acts.	None
The discussions on the subject must revolve round keeping the aforementioned factor in mind.	None
The importance as regard fixation of price of coal and tea has a direct bearing with the regulation of mines and minerals development as also the Tea Industry.	None
the Central Government has also reduced the custom duty on coal taking into the aforementioned consideration in view as would appear from a notification issued by the Central Government on 8.1.2004 under the provisions of the Customs Act.	None
148.	None
the importance of fixation of value of coal will also be noticed from the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 1957 Act as the State even did not intend to increase the rate of royalty, which would have an adverse effect on production of coal.	None
The impact of value of coal by reason along been kept in mind by the Parliament.	None

if a restricted meaning is given to Entries 52, 54 and 97 of List I and a broad meaning is given to Entries 5, 23, 24, 49 and 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, the same may result in incongruity inasmuch as thereby the goal and object of the Constitution makers would not be achieved.	None
by enacting the 1953 Act and the 1957 Act, the Parliament intended that nothing should come in the way of mineral development or tea industry.	None
The Court while interpreting the statutes should avoid such construction whereby the State Legislature would be encroaching upon the areas covered by the Parliamentary Act indirectly which they could not do directly.	None
It must also be borne in mind that Entries 54 and 52 of List I stand on different footings.	None
In terms of Entry 54 List I, if a declaration is made by the Parliament to regulate mines and minerals development the power of the State Legislature to make any legislation in relation thereto is denuded whereas in terms of Entry 52 List I of Seventh Schedule the Parliament by law declares the control of industries to be expedient in public interests.	None
The power to make law by the State Legislature in respect of such industries, thus, upon such declaration shall stand denuded.	None
Cultivation of tea would also come within the purview of tea industry having regard to the provisions of the Tea Act is beyond and cavil.	None
Interpretation of General Entry visavis Tax Entries Principles of interpretation on the conflicting entries cannot be placed in a strait jacket formula.	None
Rule of interpretation will vary, depending upon the subject matter of legislation.	None

None
One of the principles for reconciling conflicting tax entries is to ascertain as to whether a person, thing or activity is the subject matter of tax and the amount of the tax to be levied.	None
The question which has to be answered on the basis of the aforementioned principle is, is it a tax on land or tax on mineral.	None
If having regard to the nature of tax and keeping in view the history of the legislation to the effect that the State of West Bengal has all along been trying to impose tax on minerals as opposed to tax on land, is taken into consideration, it will be noticed that endeavours have been made to continue to impose cess on mineral and mineral rights in the garb of land tax.	None
The decisions of this Court as referred to hereinbefore including India Cement (supra) must be judged from this angle and not in vacuum.	None
It may be true that taxation is regarded as a distinct matter and has separately set out in List I or List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India but the what should be borne in mind is that the same by itself is not determinative of the nature of the statute.	None
There are statutes and statutes one statute may cover general entry as also a taxation entry whereas another may be enacted only in terms of the general entry and third in terms of a tax entry.	None

It fact that under the constitutional scheme taxation is regarded as a distinct matter and is separately set out is not decisive for the purpose of determining the validity thereof.	None
There exist a large number of statutes and indeed the constitutional scheme permits imposition of tax to regulate a particular trade.	None

the observation in Synthetics Chemicals Vs.	None
State of U.P. (1991) SCC 109	None
that the tax may not be levied under a general entry although may be correct but the same would not mean that a regulatory fee which is in the nature of a tax cannot also be imposed.	None
No hard and fast rule can, therefore, be laid down and each case has to be considered on its own merit.	None
Can it, therefore, be said that a regulating statute being a general statute, no tax thereunder could be imposed.	None
It may not be necessary for us to delve deep into the matter as to whether power of regulation and control is separate and distinct from the power of taxation.	None
Generally speaking, it may be true that power to regulate would not carry with it the power to impose tax but the same does not have an universal application.	None
The question which would arise for consideration is whether constitutional scheme expressly permits such a legislation but the question which should be posed is as whether the constitutional scheme prohibits enactment of such a statute.	None
Such prohibition does not exist and in that view of the matter, it is permissible for the Parliament to enact a statute both in terms of a general entry as also a taxing entry.	None
No decision has been brought to our notice to suggest that the same is impermissible in our constitutional scheme.	None
As regard Entry 97 of List I, this Court in Union of India Vs.	None
Shri Harbhajan Singh Dhillon (1971) 2 SCC 779 held The last sentence applied much more to the Constitution of a sovereign democratic republic.	None
it is true that there are some limitations in Part III of the Constitution on the Legislatures in India but they are of a different character.	None
They have nothing to do with legislative competence.	None
If This is the true scope of residuary powers of Parliament, then we are unable to see why we should not, when dealing with a Central Act, enquire where it is legislation in respect of any matter in List II for this is the only field regarding which there is a prohibition against parliament.	None
If a Central Act does not enter or invade these prohibited fields there is no point in trying to decide as to under which entry or entries of List I or List III a Central Act would rightly fit in.	None
(See also Satpal Co. (1979) 3	None
SCR 1031).	None
The Parliament can impose excise duty on coal in terms of Entry 86 of List I.	None
A regulatory fee which would also be in the nature of tax can also be imposed under Entry 54 read with Entry 97.	None
There is no limitation on the power of the Parliament to make an Act under several entries, one of which may be a tax entry.	None
This Court must also not forget that there exists a difference in interpretation between an entry relating to fee and entry relating to tax.	None
Once it is held that the matters in the State List is to the extent of declaration stand substracted from the scope and ambit of Entry 23 of the State List, even no fee can be levied which will come in the way of Central Governments power of regulation of mines.	None
Assuming royalty, deed rent and surface rent would not come within the purview of definition of tax, this Court is merely required to consider as to whether such a power exists in the Parliament or not.	None
The validity of the Mines and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act is not in question.	None
Section 25 of the 1957 Act in no uncertain terms states that any rent, royalty, tax, fee or other impost under the said Act or the rules made thereunder can be recovered as arrears of land revenue.	None
The very fact that the expression tax, fee or other sum due to the Government which could be imposed under the Act and the recovery thereof is the subject matter of Section 25 of the Act, this Court, as noticed hereinbefore, in a large number of decisions held that such a power to impose tax exists under the Act.	None
Question of recovery of tax would arise only when it is imposed under the Act or the rules framed thereunder.	None
Section 25 of the MMRD Act, 1957 by necessary implication refers to the taxing power of the Parliament.	None
Imposition of taxes on minerals rights would affect the development of mines and minerals.	None
the Parliaments authority to regulate and control mineral development would be seriously impaired and affected if it is held that the matter relating to imposition of tax on mineral is also vested in the State.	None
The vires of Section 9 and 9A of the 1957 Act has not been questioned.	None

Furthermore, Entry 36 of List I of the Government of India Act, 1935 was the corresponding provision of Entry 54 of List I of the Constitution.	None
Similarly, Entries 23 and 44 were the corresponding provisions in the List II in the Government of India Act containing identical provisions as in Entries 23 and 50 of List II of the Constitution.	None
Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 was enacted which was refereable to Entry 36 of List I of the 1935 Act.	None
the said 1948 Act inter alia contains provisions for levy of taxes.	None
See Section 6(2) of the 1948 Act.	None
The history of legislation as regard regulation of mine and development of mineral is a pointer to the fact that Section (6)(2) of the 1948 Act not only provided for prohibition of the mining, quarrying or digging or the excavating or collecting of minerals from any mine or in any area, but also provided for imposition of tax.	None
Nobody says that by reason of rule making power, a tax can be levied under Section 13(2)(i) but what has been held by this Court is that the field of imposition of tax, fee or any other sum has been conferred on the Parliament under the Mines and Mineral (Regulation and Development) Act itself by necessary implication or otherwise as otherwise there would not have been any reason for the Parliament to say that such tax, fee or any other sum due to the Government under this Act meaning thereby 1951 Act or the rules framed thereunder would be recoverable.	None
It may also be true that by reason of rule making power as contained in Section 13(2) and Section 15(1A) the Parliament has not delegated the power to impose tax upon the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be.	None
This might have been done considering the fact that the Parliament would make use of it, as and when occasion arises therefor.	None
The Parliament by enacting Sections 25 both in the 1957 Act and the 1953 Act reserved the authority upto itself to imposed any other tax falling in List I. the Parliament may also impose a tax which otherwise would not fall in any one of the taxing entries but may fall under the residuary entry being Entry 97.	Arguments of Respondent
Only because in Section 1392) or Section 15 (1A) of the Act power to impose tax has not been delegated, the same would not mean that the field in relation thereto is not covered as the said expression specifically finds place in Section 25 of the Act.	None

M.A. Tulloch 1964 (4) SCR 461 , the interpretation of Section 25 under Act No. 67 of 1957 Act did not fall for consideration.	None
Recovery of tax is an incident of imposition of tax.	None
Tax has three elements (i) taxing event (ii) assessment and (iii) recovery.	None
Recovery of a tax is part of the taxing statute.	None
The provision of another Parliamentary Act cannot be resorted to for realisation of tax imposed by the State or vice versa.	None
The power to impose tax, therefore, cannot be traced to Section 13 alone but must also be traced to Section 25.	None
If that view is taken, it would not be necessary to apply the principle of ejusdem generis for the purpose of interpretation of Section 2(1) and 13(2)(i) of the Act.	None
Those taxes fees and charges which would come in the way of regulation of mine and mineral development should be held to have been forbidden.	None
So read Sections 13(2) and 25 can be given an appropriate meaning.	None
It will, therefore, not be correct to say that Section 25 can be construed to be containing only a recovery provision.	None
The question, it will bear repetition to state, would be not that as to whether any tax, fee or any other charges of whatever nature have been levied under the 1957 Act but the question would be whether the field in respect thereof is covered or not.	None
In that view of the matter, the question of inference as regard the power to tax by necessary implication or otherwise would not arise.	None
For the aforementioned purpose what would not arise.	None
For the aforementioned purpose what would be required to be considered is to read Sections 13, 18 and 25 together harmoniously.	None
It may be true that in Section 25 the Parliament has not explicitly stated as to tax would be due to whom but that would not mean the provision is vague.	None
That would simply mean that whosoever would be entitled to the impost can take recourse thereto.	None
Under the 1957 Act, it is the State Governments who are the beneficiaries but that is of not much consequence.	None
M.A. Tulloch (supra) must be read in the aforementioned context and so read the logical corollary would be that the field for levy of tax, fee of other charges must be held to have been covered under the 1957 Act.	None
Entry 97, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India indisputably should be taken recourse to as a last resort but once it is held that the Parliament has expressed its intension to cover the field of taxation also under the 1957 Act, source of such power must be traced to the appropriate entries in List I including Entry 97, whence if no other source is traceable.	None
The matter may be considered from another angle.	None
The States on their own showing are entitled to levy tax upon exercising the power which are said to be in terms of Entries 49 and 50 of List II and in that view of the matter Section 25 of the Act can be taken recourse to for the purpose of recovery of tax imposed in terms of the statute enacted by the State.	None
To put it differently, the provisions of the Central Act which is said to be meant for recovery of the tax, fee and other charges imposed in terms of provisions thereof or the rules made thereunder cannot be resorted for recovery of any tax made by the State in terms of its taxing power under any of the entries contained in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the constitution of India.	None
Section 25 of the 1957 Act could have been taken recourse to for the purpose of recovery of dues to the State provided the State Act was inter linked with the Parliamentary Act or the same was otherwise permissible in terms of the constitutional scheme.	None
177.	None
it is now a well settled principle of law that words in a statute should be so construed so as not to be considered as surplages or superfluous.	None
Each would, as is wellknown must be given its proper meaning.	None
If the aforementioned principle of interpretation of statute is applied, it must be held that the Parliament made its intention clear so as to cover the entire field including the field of taxation as otherwise there is absolutely no reason as to why consciously the words tax, fee or any other charges have been used in Section 25 of the Act.	None
The decision in Union of India vs. Shri Harbhajan Singh Dhillon (1991) 2 SCC 779 is also relevant in the context.	None
In the said decision, this Court was concerned with the provision of Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1969 whereby the definition net wealth in the Wealth Tax Act was amended including the agricultural land in assets for the purpose of calculating tax on the capital value of the net wealth.	None
The High Court held the said provision as unconstitutional.	None
The majority speaking through Sikri, CJ, gave effect to Article 248 of the Constitution of India stating We must also mention that no material has been placed before us to show that it was ever in the mind of anybody, who had to deal with the making of the Constitution, that it was the intention to prohibit all the Legislature in this country from legislating on a particular topic.	None
In the said decision, therefore, it was held that the Parliament in certain situation has the legislative competence to impose tax touching agricultural activities although agriculture comes within the legislative domain of the State legislature.	None
Such a finding was arrived at having regard to the fact that the Parliament was aware that specific provision may not be found in the three Lists for the purpose of imposition of all types of taxes and in that situation Entry 97 of List I could be taken recourse to.	None
But the question as to why the Parliament did not confer any power to tax the capital value of land as an asset either on the Central Government or the State Government does not fall for our consideration in this case.	None
It an occasion arises, such a question has to be considered on its own merits, but the fact remains that so far as mines and minerals are concerned, levy of tax thereupon in any manner whatsoever is not within the power of the State.	None
The State cannot assume such power indirectly by seeking to impose tax on land which it cannot to directly.	None
So far as tea a concerned, power to impose excess duty on tea is expressly conferred on the Central Government in terms of Section 25 of the Tea Act.	None

It will bear repetition to state that it is not a case where we are concerned with the validity of the tax imposed by the Parliament but we are only concerned with the interpretation of a statute in terms of the constitutional scheme of distribution of legislative fields for the purpose of ascertaining as to whether the entire field is covered by the Parliament Act or not.	None
Once it is held that the entire field of mines and minerals as also on tea including the power to impose any tax as covered by the 1953 and 1957 , the impugned tax by way of levy of cess on coal and tea must be held to the ultra vires.	None
The question as to whether the power to impose tax must be express or not is of no moment inasmuch it does not arise for our consideration.	None
Levy of excise duty on minerals is permissible in terms of Entry 86 of List I, so is power to impose income tax on profits and gains from business of mining.	None
The question as to whether the power to tax must be express or not could have been gone into had the vires of taxing statute fallen for our consideration and not otherwise.	None
The doctrine of enforcement of police power is not applicable in India.	None
Power to regulate the trade and for the said purpose imposition of tax is wellknown in India.	None

vs. M s. Devans Modern Brewaries Ltd. Anr. 2003	None
(10) SCALE 202 , majority of three Judges of a Constitution Bench of this Court upheld the levy of import tax on liquor which apparently was made by the State in terms of Entry 51, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India as a valid piece of legislation as if the same was enacted in exercise of the States regulatory power under Entry.	None
In that case, taxing statute has been upheld having been imposed by way of regulatory measure stating The High Court of Punjab proceeded to decide the case on a total wrong assumption that the import fee levied is in the nature of duty which cannot be imposed under the Excise Act, 1984 when in fact, the import fee levied is the price for parting with the privilege given to the licensee to import beer into the State and, therefore, the same is within the competence of the State to impose import fee.	None
I am of the view that the licensee besides the payment of duty etc. is to comply with such conditions as the State Government may impose while formulating the excise policy for the concerned year.	None
The State, in my view, is competent and entitled to impose excise duty or countervailing duty.	None
Besides there is no bar on the State to charge any other fees on account of consideration for the privilege provided to the licensee to trade in liquor which privilege he did not otherwise have.	None
Therefore, the licensee is liable to comply with the other conditions imposed by the State Government from time to time.	None
As held in many cases referred to supra the levy in dispute under challenge is an import levy Imposition to tax by way of regulatory measures, therefore, is permissible while enacting a regulatory statute.	None
Regulatory licence fee also has been held to be tax.	None
The decision of a SevenJudge Bench of this Court in Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. Others vs. State of U.P. Others (1990) 1 SCC 109 is also an authority for the proposition that such regulatory measures by imposing tax is permissible in law.	None
It is also for that purpose reference to Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India assumes relevance.	None
In these matters, this Court is not concerned with an imposition of tax as a result whereof the trade or commerce in the commodity in question is affected.	None
In this case, the court is concerned with interpretation of statutes whereby the power of taxation on fixation of price thereof is vested in the Central Government under the Parliamentary Act, viz.	None
the 1957 Act and the Tea Act, 1953 and in that view of the matter the contention that the State has a plenary power of taxation loses significance.	None
Brother Lahoti, J. has referred from Cooley on Constitutional Law and G.P. Singhs Principles of Statutory Interpretation so as to emphasise the necessity of strict interpretation of a taxing statute.	None
Once a strict construction of a taxing statute is applied it is possible to hold that the exercise of the States jurisdiction is really an act of fraud on the constitution inasmuch while imposing tax on land it seeks to levy tax on mines and minerals or tea in relation whereto it has even no regulatory power.	None
Furthermore, we have noticed hereinbefore that the cess imposed by the State of West Bengal is not reasonable as the same will have a great repercussion on the activities on coal bearing land.	None
It may not be proper for the Court to venture into an enquiry as to whether the impugned tax would hamper mineral development or not but once it is found that it thinkers with the subject, having regard to the constitutional scheme the State would be denuded of its power.	None
If despite the same, a State chooses to exercise such power, its action will be fraudulent and cannot be supported for any purpose whatsoever, even if thereby a reasonable tax or fee has been levied.	None
With utmost respect, I may observe that this Court may be setting a wrong precedent to ignore larger Bench decisions of this Court relying on or on the basis of the comments made by an author, however, eminent he may be, as judicial discipline mandates that we follow binding precedents.	None
An author is entitled to criticise a judgment but such criticism cannot be the basis for ignoring binding decisions of larger benches.	None
The principles of reading a judgment is wellknown.	None
What is binding in terms of Article 141 of the Constitution of India is the ratio of the judgment.	None
The ratio decidend of a judgment is the reason assigned in support of the conclusion.	None
It the reasons contained in a judgment do not appeal to a subsequent Bench, the matter may be referred to a large Bench but so long the same is not done, the ratio can neither be watered down nor brushed aside.	None
India Cement (supra), Orissa Cement (supra) and others judgments of Coordinate Benches are binding on us.	None
Correctness or otherwise of the said judgments has not been questioned.	None
It would, therefore, not be proper for this Court to read something in the judgment which does not appear therefrom or to exclude from our consideration reasonings on the basis whereof, the conclusions of the judgment had been reached.	None
If imposition of a regulatory fee is permissible on mineral of tea then the power therefor must be held to be in the Central Government having regard to the 1957 Act and the 1953 Act.	None
If the subject matter of tax is land, the power is with the State Government unless its power is denuded or otherwise limited.	None
However, anything which entrenches upon the field of Regulation of Mines and Minerals Development or industrial activities whether by reason of levy of any tax or impost, would necessarily be forbidden.	None
Entry 49 List II  Interpretation of General Entry 49 of List II confers legislative competence upon the State to impose tax on Land and Building.	None
Coalbearing land or mineral bearing land for the purpose of Entry 49, however, may not be equated with the land as ordinarily understood.	None
Land in its ordinary meaning may be an agricultural land or a nonagricultural land.	None
It may also be mineral bearing land.	None
Mineral bearing lands, however, are governed by the provisions of the 1957 Act and the rules framed thereunder, so far as the same is covered by the declaration contained in the statute.	None
In terms of the provisions of the said Act, cess, dead rent, as well as surface rent are payable.	None
Tea Industry is governed by 1953 Act.	None

When, thus, the field is covered by Parliamentary Legislations, an effort has to be made that a conflict with a State Legislation is avoided.	None
Entry 49, List II visavis 1957 Act In assessing the field covered by an Act of Parliament, one has to be guided not merely by the actual provisions of the Act or the Rules made thereunder, but should also take into account matters and aspects which can be legitimately brought with the scope of the statute.	None
In this case, we are concerned with the interpretation of two entries in List I and List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
The legislative competence in terms of Entry 49 List II is to be considered in the light of Entry 54 List I.	None
In a case of this nature, the court cannot raise a presumption of constitutionality of the State Act as the ultimate answer to the question will have to be ascertained as to which extent the field is covered.	None
If the tax on mines and minerals is subject matter which is covered under the 1957 Act, the power of the State must be held to be denuded.	None
Entry 49 of List II, however, should be read in such a manner so that the surface land must have a direct nexus with the subsoil right which is an inchoate right.	None
Indisputably, subsoil right would include mineral right.	None
Mining lease for winning of coal may be granted for huge area but depending on the nature of mining activities to be carried on, necessarily the mining lessee would not require the entire surface thereof except where mineral is being extracted by adopting quarrying method.	None
A mineral can be extracted from beneath a town.	None
village, national highway, railway track etc. in any manner, without disturbing the surface itself, subject of course upon carrying out the activities in such a scientific manner so that proper and adequate support to the surface is provided.	None
Mineral right may extend to more that one town or village.	None
Thus, there can be separate owners for the surface and the underground.	None
The right of the owner of the surface would necessarily cast a statutory or a contractual liability upon the mining lessee to provide the requisite support to the surface so as not to cause subsidence thereof.	None
If a wide definition of coal bearing land is given so as to hold that the State is entitled to levy tax on extracted mineral which is severed from land, the same would lead to an incongruous result as thereby value of part of the land itself would be a subject matter of measure of tax although they do not remain land as such.	None
In any event, coal severed from land cannot be said to be yield on coal bearing land so as to hold that the value thereof can be determined only for the purpose of measure of tax visavis the nature and character thereof.	None
A tax on land can be imposed so long a land exists.	None

2 SCC 686 , Orissa Cement (supra), India Cement (supra) and other cases observed 14 While upholding the validity of the Act this Court held that Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule contemplates the levy of tax on lands and buildings or both as units.	None
Tax on lands and building is directly imposed on lands and buildings and bears a definite relation to it 15Therefore, in order that a tax can be levied under Entry 49 of List II it is essential that land as a unit must exist on which the tax is imposed 16Therefore, in pith and substance it is a tax on activity on land and not on land itself.	None

Goodricke case is clearly distinguishable.	None
There education cess and rural employment cess were levied on certain lands and buildings in the State of West Bengal.	None
The estates were carved out as a separate category and a different rate was prescribed therefor.	None
The cess on tea estates was calculated on the basis of yield of tea whereas cess on other lands was determined having regard to the development value of the same.	None
It was held that the tax was upon land though the cess was quantified on the basis of produce of the tea estate.	None
In the present case, however, we do not find that the tax is on land.	None
In fact what is sought to be taxed is in the absence of land.	None
It was opined One of the facets of tax being levied on land is that the primary responsibility of the payment of tad is on the owner of the land.	None
In the instant case the levy is not on the general ownership of the land but is on the person who uses it and who may or may not be the owner.	None
The primary liability is on the use by the occupier and if the occupier and the owner are two different persons the liability would be that of the occupier alone and not of the owner.	None
It was further held From the aforesaid discussion it is obvious that the present tax is one is obvious that the present that is one on the excavation and use of forest land and not on the forest land as such.	None
Taxing of the undertaking of a nonforest activity in a forest land cannot be regarded as being covered by Entry 49 of the State List because what is sought to be taxed is not land but the tax is on absence of land or forest by reason of the activity of excavation and or mining or use of forest land for a nonforest purpose.	None
The High Court was, therefore, right in allowing the writ petitions filed by the respondent.	None
Underlining is mine for emphasis It is, therefore, not correct to contend that While purporting to impose tax on land and buildings a State has the legislative competence in terms of Entry 49 of List II of the Constitution while in effect and substance it will entrench upon Entry 52 or Entry 54 of List I thereof.	None
An impost on lands and buildings must be a tax directly imposed on lands and buildings and must have a definite relation thereto.	None

The former must be one directly imposed on land, levied on land as a unit and bearing a direct relationship to it The tax on land must be a direct impost.	None
Before making an endeavour to deal with the validity of tax in question, certain general principles may be noticed.	None
Indisputably in all jurisdictions real estate which would include land or building is subject to taxation unless the same is exempt or by reason of any constitutional scheme or statutory provision no tax can be imposed.	None
In Central Coalfields Ltd. vs. The State of Bihar (AIR 1991 Patna 27) Cess on coal in terms of Section 6 of the Bengal Cess Act, 1880 was to be measured on the basis of pit mouth value of coal.	None
The Division Bench noticed that the Cess Act by reason of amendments carried out lay special emphasis on mines and quarries including mineral development thereof irrespective of the fact as to whether they are situate within the Municipal area or not, held Whenever a tax is based upon the mineral rights, the same would come within the purview of Entry 50 of List II.	None
In India Cement, AIR 1990 SC 85 (supra), as indicated hereinbefore it has clearly been held by the Supreme Court that it is not permissible to read the Constitution in such a manner so as to make one Entry in any list redundant.	None

No. 368 of 1990 r, 40 of its pit head value, the same would still retain the character of a tax on land in terms of Entry 49, List II, would render Entry 50 thereof otiose and or surplusage.	None
This is against the decision of the Supreme Court in India Cement, AIR 1990 SC 85 (supra).	None
Makers of the Constitution in their wisdom have classified the fields of the legislation and conferred power upon the State to impose tax on mineral rights but the same is subject to the limitation imposed by the Parliament by law relating to regulation of mine and development of mineral.	Arguments of Respondent
Further the Supreme Court clearly held that for the purpose of upholding the validity of a tax on land or building it must be referable as a tax on the land as a unit and not on the basis of the minerals extracted from it.	None

(See also Shri Krishna Gyanodya Sugar Ltd. vs. State of Bihar (2003) 4 SCC 378 )	None
The legislative competence of the State in relation to agricultural land as also imposition of tax on land and buildings as contained in Entry 49 of List II must be considered having regard to Entry 52 or Entry 54 of List I and Entry 33 of List III.	None
The legislative competence of the State having regard to Article 246, 248 and 253 of the Constitution of India, it is trite, would be subject to the legislative competence of the Parliament.	None
Whenever a tax on land is imposed, the levy must be on the land as a unit.	None
(See India Cement (supra) paras 22, 23) The impugned levies, however, having regard to nature of impost cannot be said to be a tax on land as (a) the impost is not directly on land, (b) the levy does not concerned itself with any aspects of land i.e. extent of land, nature, character, quality or location thereof.	None
In the case of mineral, it is already embedded in the earth and there is no question of any yield in the sense that there would be an annual yield or annual income.	None
In case of tea, it is also not concerned with the productive qualities of the land and (c) the levy is not based on the land as a unit.	None
It must be noticed that the definition of coal bearing land or the tea estate and or tea is the same in both the State Acts and the Central Acts.	None
The impugned levy is entirely dependent upon the production of mineral extracted or production of tea leaves which vary from mine to mine or garden to garden or location to location and from year to year.	None
In the case of coal, the levy varies with the production of mineral without any bearing on the surface land as such.	None
An underground mining lease in respect of 100 acres can be granted with one acre of the surface land.	None
When the tax on land is imposed, the question would be to what extent the underground mining right can in the aforementioned context be subject matter thereof.	None
Tax on land can be imposed only in respect of one acre of land.	None
Can the value of coal extracted from 100 acres of land be charged when, in effect and substance, only one acre of surface land is being used and 99 acres of surface land remain untouched.	None
The aforementioned example is also a pointer to the fact that tax on land is not being imposed as a unit.	None
What would be the unit for the purpose of imposition of tax in the aforementioned context?	None
On one acre of surface land or one acre of surface land together with additional 99 acres of underground mining right?	None
Such impost, therefore, having regard to its nature and character, in our opinion, cannot be sustained in law.	None
If the contention of the State of West Bengal is accepted the same would lead to an incongruous result.	None
Cess is imposed having regard to the valuation of coal bearing land but then in a situation of this nature the question would be as to what would be the unit of land for the purpose of computing the annual value of land that is one acre of surface land or 100 acres of underground mining right.	None
Furthermore, again the mode of valuation in respect of coal bearing land, namely, one acre of land having the mineral right with surface right intact and other 99 acres of land having mineral right only without any right to use the surface should be different.	None
Yet again a situation may arise where the holder of a mining lease in relation to an underground mineral right has purchased or taken on lease the surface land for carrying out mining operations for having offices or place, stock of coal or siding a railway or transport yard wherefrom coal is transported.	None
The impugned statutes having not provided for computing the annual value of land in such different situations and, thus, the tax on land being not measurable as an independent unit of the land must be held to be not workable.	None
No known method of valuation has been shown to us which provides that although with the extraction of mineral the value of the land would be going down, the value of the coal extracted therefrom can be the method adopted for subject matter of calculating tax on the basis of the lands purported annual value.	None
Computation of annual value of land may be on the basis of actual income derived therefrom or the propensity therefor.	None
But when mineral is being taken out from the mineral bearing land, the value thereof would be diminished and a stage may come where the market value therefor would be zero or in fact the same may require further investments for compliance of the terms and conditions of instrument granting mining lease or the requirement of statutes.	None
Even a land may contain different minerals in different layers, i.e. at the surface as well as in the bowel of the earth.	None
There are lands consisting of hills or hillocks where minerals like iron ore, manganese ore or where other minor minerals like stonechips can be found Whereas the surface may contain brickearth or other minor minerals like sand etc.	None
Furthermore, the different minerals may be contained in different layers of the underground major minerals or minor minerals or both.	None
It is also permissible under the 1957 Act and the Rules framed thereunder to grant different mining leases for different minerals adopting different procedures for grant of mining leases having regard to the nature of the minerals, namely, major mineral or a minor mineral.	None
The impugned levies are, thus, taxes on coal or other mineral raised in the mining areas and not a tax on land as contemplated under Entry 49 of List II.	None
Irrespective of imposition of tax on the land as a unit, the impugned levies have only one consideration, i.e. production of coal which would, thus fall outside the purview of Entry 49 of List II.	None
In Krishna Mohan (P) Ltd. vs. Municipal Corporation of Delhi and others (2003) 7 SCC 151 )	None
the Court while considering the provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 noticed the definition of building and land contained therein which are as under The expression building is defined in Section 2(3) as under 2(3) building means a house, outhouse, stable, latrine, urinal, shed, hut, wall (other than a boundary wall) or any other structure, whether of masonry, bricks, wood, mud, metal or other material but does not include any portable shelter.	None
Land has been defined in Section 2(24) as follows 2(24) land includes benefits to arise out of land, things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth and rights created by law over any street.	None
Noticing that the expressions land and buildings had separately been defined and a distinction had been drawn by the Legislature, this Court held that the State could not levy a property tax on machinery in the guise of levy of tax on lands and buildings.	None
The tax under the impugned acts has not been imposed on land as a unit but on coal.	None
The tax, therefore, is not directly upon the land but upon a part of land, which is mineral and, thus, out of the legislative competence of the State.	None
Applying the test laid down in several decisions of this Court, we are of the opinion that the impugned cess is not a tax directly levied upon land as a unit by reason of the general ownership of the lands and buildings.	None
Mineral Bearing Land visavis General Rights over Land Land may consist of several rights.	None
The surface of the land may be in actual possession of an occupier who has no right or underraiyat or raiyat or a person having only a right to cultivate thereupon.	None
However, holders of such right ordinarily would not have any right over minerals.	None
Even if a mineral is found on the surface, they must collect the same and keep in at the corner of the land so that the same may be taken away by the owner thereof, which in a case of mining lease, would be mining lessee.	None
Mineral may be found in the mineral bearing land.	None
Mineral bearing land may, thus, contain mineral as the product of the nature.	None
Mineral may, however, also be deposited on the surface by reason of certain activities as, for example, coal slurry which has been held to be mineral may come out of the coal washing plants and deposited in the rivers, nalas or the agricultural fields.	None
Slurry has been held to be a mineral and, thus, governed by provisions of the MMRD Act.	None
(See Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (supra).	None
Bheemagari Bhaskar and others vs. Revenue Divisional Officer, Bhongir and others (2002 (1) ALT 159 ) is another instance where a question arose as regard sand deposited on the land of the Pattadars and claimed by them in terms of the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948.	None
Such a claim was rejected by the Andhra Pradesh High Court referring to Jagadish Chandra vs. Kanai Lal (AIR 1951 Patna 525), Kusum Kamini vs. Jagdish Chandra (AIR 1941 Patna 13) and Purnendu Narain Singh vs. Narendra Nath (AIR 1943 Patna 31), holding sand being a minor mineral, the agriculturists have no right thereover.	None
It was further held that grant of lease in respect of the said minor mineral can be granted by the State and in terms of the 1957 Act and the rules framed thereunder.	None
Some rights are capable of granted by holders of same or higher rights and some only by the State.	None
Even the State, having regard to the doctrine of public trust, may not have any power to grant any right in relation to certain matters, e.g., deep underground water.	None
Deep underground water belongs to the State in the sense that doctrine of public trust extends thereto.	None
Holder of land may have only a right of user and cannot take any action or do any deeds as a result whereof the right of others is affected.	None
Even the right of user is confined to the purpose for which the land is held by him and not for any other purpose.	None
Even in relation to such matters, no prescriptive right under Section 25 of the Limitation Act would be attracted.	None
Further, even by reason of Section 25 of the Limitation Act, a person must exercise an easementary right without interruption for a period of 30 years in relation to air, way or watercourse or the use of any water or any other easement by enjoying it peaceably and openly as an easement and as of right.	None
Then only such exercise of right to air, way, watercourse, use of water or other easement becomes absolute and indefeasible.	None
A person who holds land for agricultural purpose may, therefore, subject to any reasonable restriction that may be made by the State may have the right to use water for irrigational purposes and for the said purpose he may also excavate a tank.	None
But under no circumstances, he can be permitted to restrict flow of water to the neighbouring lands or discharge the effluents in such a manner so as to affect the right of his neighbour to use water for his own purposes.	None
On the same analogy he does not have any right to contaminate the water to cause damages to the holders of the neighbouring agricultural fields.	None
Large scale defoulment in the quality of water so as to make it unusable by others of as a result whereof the water is contaminated and becomes unpotable would be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.	None
In M.C. Mehta vs. Kamal Nath, (1997) 1 SCC 388 ), this Court has quoted with approval an article entitled Public Trust Doctrine in Natural Resource Law Effective Judicial Intervention of Joseph L. Sax, Professor of Law, University of Michigan.	None
The High Court of Kerala recently by a judgment dated 16th December, 2003 in Perumatty Gram Panchayat Perumatty Vandithayalam P.O., Chettur Taluk represented by its President Sri A. Krishnan vs. State of Kerala and others (W.P.(C) No. 34292/2003 (G) restrained Hindustan Coca Coal Beverages Limited from using ground water for running its plant at Plachimada in Palakkad district stating that the ground water was a national wealth and it belongs to the entire society.	None
It was observed that water was nectar sustaining life on earth and, thus, the State has a duty to protect ground water against excessive exploitation and inaction on its part tantamounts to infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.	None
The purpose of discussions aforementioned is that while imposing a tax on land and in particular mineral bearing land the Legislature must exercise its power consciously.	None
It must be borne in mind that power to impose tax should not be exercised in a casual or caveliar manner.	None
The members of the legislature must be informed as regard the exact subject matter of tax.	None
It, while imposing a tax on the subject (A) cannot indirectly levy an impost on subjects (B) and (C) and while the validity thereof is challenged, the State cannot be heard to say that subject (B) or subject (C) also come within the legislative power having regard to other entries of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
Entry 50 authorities the State to tax mineral rights which has no corelation with the power to tax land.	None
If both the entries are resorted simultaneously, the statutes bear out the same.	None
From the impugned acts, it cannot be informed that the State intended to levy tax both on land and mineral right.	None
The entire gamut of argument, having regard to India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra) was confined to Entry 49 but Entry 50 of List I has been taken recourse to in a halfhearted manner.	None
If a mining operation is carried out through digging incline or pits, the area of the underground may be more than the surface.	None
In that view of the matter, a tax on land cannot be levied having regard to different rights over the same surface unless it is so done on a unit.	None
Only because etymologically the land may mean from the surface to the center of the earth, the holder of an agricultural right or nonagricultural right may not have any right over the subterranean right.	None
Such subterranean right may be used only for the purpose public interest granted to the holder of land under the relevant statute governing the field.	None
The holder of a limited tenancy right, thus, cannot construct a dam or take out all water or mineral underneath.	None
1957 ACT VISAVIS ENTRY 50 OF LIST II The contour of the 1957 Act would clearly show that the Union had taken over the entire control of mining industry.	None
The 1957 Act is a comprehensive Act.	None
It is a selfcontained Code.	None
Grant of mineral rights, undoubtedly, would come within the purview of regulation of mine and mineral development in terms of the 1957 Act.	None
The entire field of legislation is covered by Parliament Act of 1957.	None
When a mining lease is granted, consideration for parting with the mineral right would be a part of the terms and conditions thereof.	None
The right to receive royalty is also a mineral right.	None
State indisputably receives royalty as a consideration for grant of mining lease in terms of the 1957 Act.	None
Brother Lahoti referring to Blacks Law Dictionary, 7th Edition also noticed that a mineral rights vests in the owner of the land and is capable of being parted with.	None
As discussed hereinbefore, such a right has vested in the States exclusively and furthermore as grant of such right is governed by the provisions of Parliamentary Acts, the same cannot be subject matter of levy of tax imposed by a law made in terms of Entry 50 of List I.	None
The terms and conditions including the right to receive royalty, the mode, manner and extent thereof the limitations in relation thereto as well as enhancement in the quantum thereof are fixed by the statutory provisions, and, thus, the State would be denuded of its power to impose any further levy, impost or tax thereupon.	None
Entry 50 of List II is unique in the sense that it is the only Entry in all the Entries in the three Lists (Lists I, II and III) (apart from Entry 37) in the Seventh Schedule where the taxing power of State Legislature has been subjected to any limitation imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development.	None
Therefore the moment Parliament makes any law relating to mineral development, the State Legislatures are denuded of their legislative competence to impose any tax or levy on minerals and or minerals and or mineral rights.	None
Entry 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India is subject to law enacted by Parliament in terms of Entry 54 List I of the Constitution of India, and, thus we have no doubt in our mind that a power to levy of tax on mineral right or on despatch of mineral does not exist in the State.	None
In Blacks Law Dictionary mineral right has been defined as an interest in minerals in land.	None
A right to takes minerals or a right to receive a royalty.	None
Right to receive royalty is, thus, also a mineral right.	None
In the same dictionary, mineral has been defined as any valuable inert or lifeless substance formed or deposited in its present position through natural agencies alone, and which is found either in or upon the soil of the earth or in the rocks beneath the soil.	None
The power to tax on mineral rights, therefore, would essentially be different from a right to tax on mineral actually extracted.	None
Wanchoo, J., in Hingir Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. and The State of Orissa and others (AIR 1961 SC 459 ) observed Thus tax on mineral rights would be confined, for example, to taxes on leases of mineral rights and on premium or royalty for that.	None
Taxes on such premium and royalty would be taxes on mineral rights while taxes on the minerals actually extracted would be duties of excise.	None
The learned Judge further observed There would be no difficulty where an owner himself works the mine to value the mineral rights on the same principles on which leases of mineral rights are made and then to tax the royalty, which, for example, the owner might have got if instead of working the mine himself he had leased it out to somebody else.	None
There can be no doubt therefore that taxes on mineral rights are taxes of this nature and not taxes on minerals actually produced.	None
If the intention of the Constitution maker was to confer an absolute power upon the State Legislature to levy tax whether on mineral rights or minerals, the same could have been worded differently.	None
There was absolutely no necessity to restrict the power to levy tax on mineral rights in State and not to levy tax on minerals whether extracted or otherwise.	None
Mineral rights, therefore, cannot be construed as a mineral already extracted as contradistinguished from being capable of extraction or otherwise in a state or from when embedded in the earth.	None
The State Legislature, therefore, has no legislative competence to impose tax on minerals.	None
In the present context, in view of the 1957 Act, it has also no legislative competence to levy tax on mineral rights which will have a direct impact on mineral development.	None
In Hingir Rampur (supra), as noticed hereinbefore, the 1948 Act was held to have occupied the entire field of regulation of mine and mineral development.	None
The 1957 Act having regard to Entry 54 of List I contains substantially similar provisions.	None
Even in State of Orissa vs. M.A. Tolluch (1964 (4) SCR 461 ), the 1957 Act was held to have occupied the entire field of mines and mineral development.	None
This Court rejected the contention that the 1957 Act does not contain any provision for levy of tax having regard to Section 25 of the 1957 Act and held that the said provision, by implication, provided for levy of tax.	None
In India Cement (supra) also this Court held It seems, therefore, that attention of the court was not invited to the provisions of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 and Section 9 thereof.	None
Section 9(3) of the Act in terms states that royalties payable under the Second Schedule of the Act shall not be enhanced more than once during a period of four years.	None
It is, therefore, a clear bar on the State legislature taxing royalty so as to in effect amend Section Schedule of the Central Act.	None
In the premises, it cannot be right to say that tax on royalty can be a tax on land, and even if it is a tax, if it falls within Entry 50 will be ultra vires the State legislative power in view of Section 9(3) of the Central Act.	None
In HingirRampur Coal Co. Ltd. vs. State of Orissa (1961) 2	Reasoning
SCR 537 AIR 1961 SC 459 ), Wanchoo, J., in his dissenting judgment has stated that a tax on mineral rights being different from a duty of excise pertains only to a tax that is leviable for the grant of the right of extract minerals, and is not a tax on minerals as well.	None
On that basis, a tax on royalty would not be a tax on mineral rights and would therefore in any event be outside the competence of the State legislature.	None
In Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. (supra), the power of the Central Government to enhance new rates of royalty on various grades of coal was in question.	None
The arguments as regard lack of legislative competence was repelled referred to India Cement in the following words In our considered opinion there is no substance in either of the twin contentions for challenging vires of Section 9(3).	None
So far as competence to enact Section 9 is concerned, the question is no longer res integra In India Cement (supra), a 7Judge Bench of this Court held that the 1957 Act and the declaration contained therein being a legislation controlled by Entry 54 of List I the whole field is occupied and Entry 50 of List II is totally excluded.	None
In India Cement (supra), thus, this Court has held that not tax can be imposed by the State which would have a direct impact on the quantum of royalty.	None
Further, in Laxminarayan Mining Co. vs. Taluk Dev Board (AIR 1972 MYS 299) which has been approved in India Cement, the Mysore High Court observed that a combined reading of Entries 23 50 in List II and Entry 54 in List I establishes that a long as the Parliament does not make any law in exercise of its power under Entry 54, the powers of the State Legislature in Entries 23 and 50 would be exercisable by the State Legislature.	None
But once the Parliament makes a declaration by law that it is expedient in the public interest to make regulation of mines and minerals development under the control of the Union, to the extent to which such regulation and development is undertaken by law made by the Parliament, the field of the State Legislature is undertaken by law made by the Parliament, the field of the State Legislature under Entries 23 and 50 of List II are denuded.	None
On this reasoning, in the Mysore High Court judgment, a Legislation by the State conferring power on the Taluk Board as per impugned notification to levy tax on mining activities was held to be unauthorized.	None
It would not be correct to contend that this decision cannot be read so widely.	None
The power to tax in terms of Entry 50 is subject to a Parliamentary Act.	None
If a Parliamentary Act operates in the field the right of the State to levy tax or fee is completely taken out from their legislative competence.	None
The 1957 Act deals with mineral rights and admittedly has occupied the entire field relating to regulation of mine and mineral development.	None
Any tax on mineral rights would be counter productive to mineral development in constitutionally impermissible.	None
Once it is held that the entire field of legislation is occupied by the Parliament in view of the 1957 Act and the declarations contained therein evidently Entry 50 of List II would not be attracted.	None
This has been held uniformly by this Court and some High Courts in a series of decisions.	None
The matter may be considered from another angle.	None
Under the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 and Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973, as noticed hereinbefore, all coking coal mines mentioned in the schedule appended to the 1972 Act and all coal mines vested in the Central Government.	None
In terms of Section 7 of the 1972 Act and Section 9 of the 1973 Act, the Central Government was empowered to transfer the said coking coal mines and coal mines to any Government company, as may be notified.	None
Pursuant to or in furtherance of the said enabling provision, the Central Government created various public sector undertakings and transferred the Coking Coal Mines and the Coal Mines as the case may be, to one government company or the other, as a result whereof all the public sector undertakings have become mining lessees in relation thereto as if they had been granted a mining lease in terms of the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act and the rules framed thereunder for the remainder of the term.	None
All coking coal mines and coal mines except a very few, thus have become subject matter of statutory mining leases by reason of a legal fiction created under the 1972 and 1973 Acts.	None
In that view of the matter too, Entry 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India may not have any application to such coking coal mines and coal mines, as they have been taken over and are being run by the Government companies in terms of the provisions of the Parliamentary Acts.	None
The expression any limitations in Entry 50 of List II should not be given a restricted meaning as contended by the appellant.	None
In fact, the rule of interpretation that the language of the entries should be given widest scope, should equally apply to the interpretation of the said words.	None
So read, the limitations on taxes on mineral rights could be in any form, including occupying the entire field of legislation under Entry 50 of List II by a Parliamentary legislation and providing for levy of taxes.	Reasoning
The MMRD Act, 1957 precisely achieves the said objectives by occupying the entire field of legislation covered by both Entries 23 and 50 of List II.	None
(See India Cement (supra).	None
In Orissa Cement (supra), this Court explained the scope of the MMRD Act, 1957 thus Section 25 implicitly authorizes the levy of rent, royalty, taxes and fees under the Act and the Rules.	None
The scope of the powers thus conferred is very wide.	None
Read as a whole the purpose of the Union control envisaged by Entry 54 and the MMRD Act, 1957 is to provide for proper development of mines and mineral areas and also to bring about a uniformity all over the country in regard to the minerals specified in Schedule I in the matter of royalties and consequently prices.	None
This objective would be totally defeated by the impugned levy of cess on coal that has resulted in coal produced in the State of West Bengal totally unremunerative and incompetitive, the price of coal so produced being much higher than the price of coal produced in the adjoining States of Bihar, U.P., Orissa, M.P. and Maharashtra as shown in the comparative chart given below WEST BENGAL Category Guide Specification Size Baseprice per Te.

The difference in the ultmate price of coal in the State of West Bengal and other States would, thus, be around 25 of the base price.	None
The submission of Mr. Dwivedi to the effect that the cess imposed is not excessive, therefore, does not appear to be correct.	None
From the aforementioned chart, it is evident that no substantial difference can be culled out so far as the price of coal on despatch visavis at the pit head is concerned, inasmuch by reason of the amendments made in the impugned Acts only the amount of royalty and other taxes were be deducted, which would only be a sum of Rs. 10/ whereas in lieu thereof sums of Rs. 225.75, Rs. 32.25, Re. 1 and further sum of Re.1 and further sum of Re.1 would be levied on the base value of coal by way of rural employment cess, education cess, road cess and other cesses amounting to Rs. 270/ per M.T.	None
The Parliament, on the other hand, having regard to the decision in India Cement (supra) thought it expedient to increase the rate of royalty from Rs. 6.50 to Rs. 120/ per M.T.	None
The effect of imposition of cess on coal by the State of West Bengal would bring about a radical change in the price of coal in the State of West Bengal visavis the other States, the effect whereof may lead to crippling of several industries situate in the State of West Bengal or the industries depending upon supply of coal produced therein.	None
It is necessary to consider the effect of the imposts on the price of coal in the context of the legislative competence of the State visavis the Parliament having regard to the fact that the Parliament in terms of enactments made both under List I and List III of is entitled to fix the ultimate price of coal.	None
We do not intend to lay down any proposition of law that the effect of impost on the price of a commodity which is the subjectmatter of legislation will be determinative of the nature and character of the impost but what we intend to say is that the same would be a relevant consideration not only for the purpose of finding out as to wheter the same is excessive but also for determining the dispute as to whether the impost would fall within the purview of one or the other entries contained in List I or List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
It is not correct to contend, as has been done by Mr. Dwivedi that taxing entries and general entries form two separate categories and the power to tax cannot be claimed as power ancillary to general power.	None
It is not in dispute that grant of mining lease by the State is governed by the provisions of the 1957 Act.	None
It is also not dispute that payment of royalty and interest thereupon is also governed by some principles which have bearings on the price of coal.	None
Mahalaxmi Fabric Mills Ltd. (supra) has recently been noticed in South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (supra) wherein Lahoti, J. speaking for the Division Bench observed Here it is clear from the several provisions of the Act and the rules quoted hereinabove, no mining operation is permissible except in accordance with the terms and conditions of a mining lease and the rules made under the Act.	None
The rules clearly provides for payment of interest.	None
Having regard to the provisions contained in Sections 2 and 18 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 the Parliament has taken over the entire control of regulation of mines and mineral development.	None
Once such a right of extracting mineral is conferred, even if, the mineral comes out of the mine, say while washing coal in a coal washery or manufacturing coke in a Coke Plant (coal washery and coke washing plant are mines under several Parliamentary Acts as also orders and rules governing the field) the State would have no right to deal with the same.	None
Mining lease as defined in Section 3(c) of the Act means a lease granted for the purpose of undertaking mining operations, and includes a sublease granted for such purpose.	None
Mining Operations as defined in Section 3(d) means any operationsundertaken for the purpose of winning any minerals Section 5(1) imposes restriction on the grant of mining leases by a State Government.	None
The essence of mining operation is that it must be an activity connected with mineral whether under the surface or on the earth.	None
Once the right of winning mineral is conferred in terms of the 1957 Act, the State would be denuded of any power to impose any tax in respect thereof in any form and at any place, even if the mineral is found outside the mineral bearing lands.	None
(See Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. vs. State of Bihar and others (1990) 4 SCC 557.	Reasoning
Under the three impugned Acts, as would be discussed in details hereinafter, taxes have been levied on minerals and not on mineral rights and, thus, the State Legislations cannot be supported in terms of Entry 50 of List II.	None
The levy even otherwise cannot be said to be referable to Entry 50 since It is a levy only on minerals extracted or produced from the coal mines It is on quantity of minerals produced from the mining lease The charging section is directly referable to production of coal.	None
The claim, thus, would amount to a colourable exercise of Power.	None
(See K.C.G. Narayan Deo vs. State of Orissa 1954	None
SCR 1 and Central Coalfields Ltd. and others vs. The State of Bihar and others (AIR 1991 Patna 27).	None
Mineral rights and mineral connote two different things.	None
A mineral may be embedded in earth or is extracted.	None
When it is extracted, it may be a culmination of the right to deal in mineral but the mineral rights would not include a right to despatch extracted minerals.	None
In India Cement (supra), it is stated that I any event, royalty is directly relatable only to the minerals extracted on the principle that the general provision is excluded by the special one, royalty would be relatable to Entries 23 and 50 of List II, and not Entry 49 of List II.	None
But as the field is covered by Central Power under Entry 23 or Entry 50 of List II, the impugned legislation cannot be upheld.	None
In Ajit Singh vs. Union of India and others (1995) Supp.	None
(4) SCC 224), the question which arose was as to whether upon revocation of a mining lease, the area becomes available for regrant and, therefore, whether it is permissible to issue an administrative order fixing a date therefor.	None
It was held that such an administrative order would not be inconsistent with the Rajasthan Minor Mineral Concessions Rules, 1977.	None
In Inderjeet Singh Sial and Another vs. Karam Chand Thapar and others (1995) 6 SCC 166 ), this Court was interpreting a deed of assignment.	None
While noticing that royalty refers to jura regalia or jura regia i.e. royal rights and prerogatives of a sovereign in the primary sense, but it was held to signify, as in mining leases, that part of the reddendum, variable though, payable in cash or kind, for rights and privileges obtained.	None
However, having regard to the tender of the covenants contained in the deed of assignment, it was held .	None
The word royalty thus, in the deed used in a loose sense use as to convey liability to make periodic payments to the assignor for the period during which the lease would subsists payments dependent on the coal gotten and extracted in quantities or on despatch.	None
We have therefore to construe document x.	None
D5 on its own terms and not barely on the label or description given to the stipulated payments.	None
Conceivably this arrangement could well have been given a shape by using another word.	None
The word royalty was perhaps more handy for the authors to be employed for an arrangement like this, so as to ensure periodic payments.	None
In no event could the parties be put to blame for using the word royalt as if arrogating to themselves the royal or sovereign right of the State and then make redundant the rights and obligations created by the deed.	None
In Quarry Owners Association vs. State of Bihar (2000) 8 SCC 655 ), the royalty is the tax while agreeing thereto, it was observed In considering this submission we have to keep in mind, tax on this royalty is distinct from other forms of taxes.	None
This is not like a tax on income, wealth, sale or production of goods (excise) etc.	None
This royalty includes the price for the consideration of parting with the right and privilege of the owner, namely, the State Government who owns the mineral.	None
In other words, the royalty deed rent, which a lessee or licensee pays, includes the price of minerals which are the property of the State.	None
Both royalty and dead rent are integral parts of a lease.	None
This, it does not constitute usual tax as commonly understood but includes return for the consideration for parting with its property.	None
In view of this special nature of the subject under consideration, namely, the minerals, it would be too harsh to insist for a strict interpretation with reference to minerals while considering the guidelines to a delegatee who is also the owner of its minerals.	None
In the present case, we are not considering any liability of tx on the assessee but whether delegation to the State by Parliament with reference to minor minerals is unbridled.	None
As by reason of a Parliament legislation in terms of Entry 54 of List I, (1957 Act) a provision has been made in terms whereof the State is compensated for parting with this mineral rights by necessary implication, it must be held that the powers to levy tax on such rights would also stand denuded.	None
If a statutory impost would come within the purview of the definition of tax as contained in Clause 28 of Article 366 of the Constitution of India, Entry 54 read with Entry 97 of List I by necessary implication must be held to include the power of taxation also.	None
So viewed, it cannot be said that Entry 54 is a general entry which does not deal with tax in that sense and particularly having regard to the fact that there does not exist any provision that the State can levy tax on extracted minerals, Parliament must, thus, also be held to have power to impose tax on extracted minerals, dehors the right to impose tax on mineral right, in terms of Entry 97 of List I. In Union and State Relations under the Indian Constitution by M.C. Setalvad at page 54, the learned author states The exercise of this power has not only helped the Union to legislate for its own purposes, but enabled it to come to the rescue of the States.	None
We may point to the Gifts Tax Act, 1958, the tax on building contracts even though no sale is involved in them a collection of annuity deposits under the Incometax Act, 1961, Chapter XXIIA inserted by section 44 of the Finance Act, No. 5 of 1964 the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly (Constitution and Proceedings) Validation Act, 1958, removing the disability of members of the Legislative Assembly of a Part C State, which have all been enacted by the Union in the exercise of its residuary power.	None
Taking any view of the matter, it cannot be said that impugned cess under the State Acts is referable to Entry 50 of List II.	None
In Quarry Owners Association vs. State of Bihar (2000) 8 SCC 655 ), imposition of royalty on mines and minerals by the State of Bihar in exercise of its power conferred upon it under Section 15 of the 1957 Act was in question while considering as to whether the State has exceeded its delegated power in levying excess royalty.	None
Interpreting the expression regulation of mines and minerals development occurring in Entry 54 List I and Entry 23 List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, it was observed The word regulation may have a different meaning in a different context but considering it in relation to the economic and social activities including the development and excavation of mines, ecological and environmental factors including States contribution in developing, meaning and controlling such activities, including parting with its wealth, viz.	None
the minerals, the fixation of the rate of royalties would also be included within its meaning Referring to the decision of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu vs. Hindi Stone (1981) 2 SCC 205 ) that such regulation may amount to prohibition it was observed that in regulating mineral development, the royalty dead rent is the inherent part of it.	None
It was observed that provision of Section 18 of the 1957 Act is not excluded from its application to the mines and minerals development.	None
Therein this Court in no uncertain terms observed It is also significant to record that minor minerals are use in the local areas for local purposes while major minerals are used for the industrial development for the national purpose.	None
The entry has been copied in verbatim from Entry 44 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935.	None
Such an entry was evidently necessary when minerals rights remained vested in private persons by reason of any grant or otherwise.	None
Even now in certain situations, a mineral right may be vested in an individual.	None
The taxing power of the State in terms of Entry 50, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India must also be viewed from the context that all the mineral rights as also the right to receive royalty by reason of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953 and U.P. Zamindary Abolition Act vested in the State.	None
Section 5(1)(a)(i) of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act reads thus 5.(1) Effect of notification  upon the due publication of a notification under Section 4, on and from the date of vesting  (a) the estates and the rights of intermediaries in the estates, to which the declaration applies, shall vest in the State free from all incumbrances in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of this clause, every one of the following rights which may be owned by an intermediary shall vest in the State namely rights in subsoil, including rights in mines and minerals	None
The State is, thus, the owner of the mineral right.	None
It is, thus, only for the State which can grant mining lease.	None
Its right to impose tax is exhausted as soon as a mineral rights is conferred.	None
In certain circumstances the State may impose tax if and when a mining lessee grant a sublease but the same also would be subject to control in terms of 1957 Act and Rule 37 of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960.	None
Thus, a transfer of mineral right includes a regulation or prohibition on creation of a subordinate interest in relation thereto.	None
Regulation of transfer of such mineral right is also therefore governed by Parliamentary legislation.	None
The State thus can not impose a tax on its own right.	None
Indisputably, requisite declaration in terms of Entry 54 has been made in Section 2 of the 1957 Act.	None
Any legislation by the State after such declaration entrenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessary be held unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the State Legislature.	None
(see Bajnath Kedia etc.	None
vs. The State of Bihar and other (AIR 1970 SC 1836).	None
The word control has been defined in Blacks Law Dictionary in the following terms Controlpower or authority to manage, direct, superintended, restricted, regulate, govern, administrator, oversee.	None
In Bank of New South Wales vs. Common Wealth (76 CLR 1), Dixon, J., observed that the word control is an unfortunate word of such wide and ambiguous import that it has been taken something weaker than restraint, something equivalent to regulation.	None
Having regard to the purport and object of the 1957 Act, the said expression must be held to be of wide import.	None
Entry 50 of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India provides for tax on mineral rights.	None
The Question which arises for the consideration in these cases is as to whether the power to tax on mineral rights and power to tax mineral is synonymous?	None
It is not.	None
Entry 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India is as under Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development.	None
Taxes on mineral rights must be different from taxes on minerals which are goods produced.	None
A tax on mineral would be in the nature of the excise duty.	None
Thus, there exists a different between taxes on mineral rights and duties of excise imposable in terms of Entry 84 of List I. Whether Royalty is a Tax?	None
Such a question may not strictly arise for consideration in this case as royalty is a statutory impost.	None
Royalty stricto sensu and in common parlance may not be a tax.	None
Whether royalty is a tax or not is required to be deliberated upon only for a limited purpose, namely, as to whether Section 25 of the 1957 Act covers the field of taxation and not for any other purpose.	None
We shall advert to this aspect of the matter at some details a little later.	None
But having regard to the definition of taxation contained in Clause 28 of Article 366 of the Constitution of India, there may not be any dispute that royalty being a statutory impost would come within the purview thereof.	None
Criticisms had been made as regard finding in India Cement (supra) that royalty is not a tax which in the fact situation obtaining therein to the effect that except for 5 of the land, royalty was to be paid to a private owner and, thus, the impost was not a statutory one may be correct.	None
A royalty may not be a tax in its usual sense as has been held in Qarry Owners Association vs. State of Bihar and others (2000) 8 SCC 655 ), but the question as to whether it will come within the purview of clause 28 of Article 366 of the Constitution of India or not has not been considered in any of the judgments.	None
The Second Schedule appended to the 1957 Act states that the royalty would be payable at the rates specified on each tonne of coal.	None
It is, therefore, a levy on the extraction or produce by weight.	None
When the cess is levied on the royalty, the levy, which remains on extraction by weight, is enhanced or incremented.	None
It is, thus, an incremental addition to the royalty.	None
Its nature and character is the same as that of royalty.	None
The value of the coal or for that matter of green tea has a direct nexus with the weight thereof.	None
Thus, there may not be any significant distinction in principle between the levy in India Cements case and levy in the present one.	None
The rate of royalty etc.	None
under the 1957 Act is fixed by the statute and not by agreement between the parties.	None
Rate of royalty may be revised subject to the limitation contained in Subsection (3) of Section 9 of the 1957 Act in respect whereof the lessees have no say in the matter.	None
Even the principle of natural justice are not required to be complied with.	None
The lessee even cannot surrender the leasehold.	None
The amount of Royalty received by the State is expended as general revenue.	None
In D.K. Trivedi sons and others vs. State of Gujarat and others (1986) (Supp.)	None
SCC 20) , it is stated In a mining lease the consideration usually moving from the lessee to the lessor is the rent for the area leased (often called surface rent), dead rent and royalty.	None
Since the mining lease confers upon the lessee the right not merely to enjoy the property as under an ordinary lease but also to extract minerals from the land and to appropriate them for his own use or benefit, in addition, to the usual rent for the area demised, the lessee is required to pay a certain amount in respect of the minerals extracted proportionate to the quantity so extracted.	None
Such payment is called royalty.	None
It may, however, be that the mine is not worked properly so as not to yield enough return to the lessor in the shape of royalty.	None
In order to ensure for the lessor a regular income, whether the mine is worked or not, a fixed amount is provided to be paid to him by the lessee.	None
This is called dead rent.	None
Dead rent is calcualted on the basis of the area leased while royalty is calculated on the quantity of minerals extracted or removed.	None
Thus, while dead rent is a fixed return to the lessor, royalty is a return which varies with the quantity of minerals extracted or removed.	None
But the power to fix surface rent, dead rent or royalty is conferred in terms of the 1957 Act or the rules framed thereunder and not on the basis of any State Act as the same would come within the term Mineral Development.	None
Royalty ordinarily, although conceptualizes a contract between parties, but as by way of the 1957 Act a statutory mining lease is granted and the terms and conditions thereof would be governed by statutes.	None
Furthermore, a unilateral statutory power has been conferred upon the Central Government which is not the owner of the mineral right, to enhance royalty, subject of course to the limitations provided for under Section 9 of the Act.	None
Ordinarily, royalty would not be a tax.	Reasoning
But in a situation of this nature and particularly having regard to the fact that the Central Government has the requisite power to fix royalty and not the owner of the mineral right,  it would be an impost within the meaning of Clause 28 of Article 366 of the Constitution of India which reads as under Article 366 (28), taxation includes the imposition of any tax or impost, whether general or local or special and tax shall be construed accordingly.	None
The impost by reason of the impugned orders may come within the purview of the aforesaid definition being a special impost on a class of citizens who are the mining lessees.	None
The amount collected by way of royalty is also expended like ordinary revenue.	None
(See Corporation of Calcutta vs. Liberty Cinema (AIR 1965 SC 1107 ), Gasket Radiators (P) Ltd. vs. ESI Corporation (1985) 2 SCC 68 ) and Hindustan Times and others vs. State of U.P. and Another (JT 2002(9)	None
SC 317 ).	None
Brick Earth Matters Brick earth although is a minor mineral, the same under certain tenancy laws can be used by the raiyats for building their own houses.	None
By way of example, we may notice subsection (2) of Section 21 of the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act, 1908 which reads thus Notwithstanding anything contained in any entries in the record of rights or any local custom or usage to the contrary, the following shall not be deemed to impair the value of the land materially or to render it unfit for purposes of the tenancy, namely The manufacture of bricks and tiles for the domestic or agricultural purposes of the raiyat and his family (b) the excavation of tanks or the digging of wells or the construction of bandhs and ahars in intended to provide a supply of water for drinking, domestic, agricultural or piscicultural purposes of the raiyat and his family and (c) the erection of buildings for the domestic or agricultural purposes or for the purposes of trade or cottage industries of the raiyat and his family.	None
The State of West Bengal has issued notices for submission of return on despatches of brick earth for the previous three years.	None
The very fact that royalty on minor mineral is required to be paid on despatches, any imposition of tax at the point of despatch must be held to be bad in law particularly having regard to the decisions of this Court in Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. vs. State of West Bengal (1989) 3 SCC 211 ).	None
Despatches of Brick earth from the Raiyati field for manufacture of brick having regard to the process of brick manufacturing as stated in the writ petition would be clearly ultra vires as what is being despatch is not brick earth but bricks manufactured on the raiyat, lands.	None
Bricks so manufactured cannot be the subject matter of land tax.	None
A tax imposed on the finished product would be excise duty.	None
Furthermore, the 1957 Act having covered the entrie field, the minor minerals also would come within the purview thereof.	None
Once the quantification of tax is made by reference to quantity of brickearth or brick despatched, measure of tax would be based on tatoal value of the mineral despatch or the material despatched.	None
It is not correct to contend that expression despatched and removed are synonymous.	None
The place or point of despatch in a particular case may be different from the place of wherefrom the mineral is raised.	None
The mineral may have to be carried to a distant place where a railway siding is situate or to a place having motorable road.	None
The cost of transport in such cases would be added to the pit head value of the mineral.	None
In case of despatch of mineral from the despatch point as contradistinguished from the pit head where from the mineral is removed, that is the land itself.	None
It may be noticed that in determining the value of the mineral for the purpose of calculating the amount of cess, the cost of transport is not excluded.	None
For the purpose of upholding the validity of a statute, it is wellknown, the doctrine of reading down thereof may not alway be taken recourse to.	None
(See Delhi Transport Corporation vs. DTC.	None
Mazdoor Congress and others AIR 1991 SC 101 ).	None
Furthermore the very fact that the methodology of royalty or cess is the same is also a relevant factor for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of tax.	None
Tax is, thus, being imposed on the activities on the land and not on the land itself.	None
The measure of cess on brick earth on the despatches of bricks which is a finished product would not be on depatches of minerals but on the materials produced from minor mineral and, thus must be held to be bad in law being beyond the purview of Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.	None
Brick earth and other minor minerals also being subject to Parliamentary control and regulation in terms of the 1957 Act, the State is denuded of its power to impose any tax thereupon or a product therefrom.	None
Minor Mineral Matters Section 3 of the U.P. Act in no uncertain terms provides for imposition of cess on mineral rights.	None
Such a cess has been imposed subject to limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development.	None
It is not in dispute that in terms of the provisions of Zamindary Abolition Act, the mineral right has vested in the State.	None
Mineral right, therefore, cannot be subject matter of taxation as the State cannot impose a tax on itself.	None
Once the 1957 Act has been made, the power of the State to grant lease on the terms and conditions which being provided under the statutes the State, over and above the amount by way of royalty, surface rent, dead rent, fees etc. cannot realize any other sum.	None
Such an impost would directly come in the way of mineral development.	None
Rule 3 of the Special Area Development Authority (Cess on Mineral Rights) Rules, 1997 clearly states that whereas cess on coal would be Rs. 5 to 10 per ton, cess on stone, coars sand etc. would be Rs. 2 to 5 per cubit metre.	None
The imposition of cess on mineral right, as noticed hereinbefore, has been held to be bad in law in several decisions of this Court and several High Courts.	None
By reason of the said Rule, even no pretence is made that cess which is a tax has been levied on the mineral and the same has got nothing to do with the land.	None
It may be true that the authority has been conferred with the power of State in relation to a municipality to levy tax but even on that ground tax cannot be imposed unless and until the State Government is held to have the requisite legislative competence therefore.	None
In terms of Entry 5 of the State List, the State cannot be held to have the legislative competence to levy tax on major mineral or minor mineral, as the case may be, as the field is covered by the 1957 Act and the rules framed thereunder and, thus, it cannot delegate the said power in favour of the statutory authority.	None
The object underlying the legislative enactment is relevant for the purpose of upholding the validity of a statute but before doing so what is required to be taken into consideration is the legislative competence.	None
The court must at the outset address itself if and when such a question is raised as to whether the State legislature had the requisite competence having regard to the Parliamentary law.	None
Once it is held that the field sought to be legislated upon by the State stand covered by a Parliamentary legislation, no further question ought to be asked.	None
Once a liberal and wide interpretation is given to Entry 54, List I, the extent of regulation of mines and minerals development under the control of the Union must be considered keeping in view the same visavis the impact thereupon by reason of the State Legislation.	None
The State act refers to mineral development which indisputably is the subject matter of the 1957 Act.	None
Section 15 of the 1957 act confers power on the State for making rules thereunder.	None
The State while doing so acts as a delegatee and not in its independent right of making a legislative enactment.	None
Both power of the State are not akin to each other.	None
They are completely different.	None
The authority under the SADA Act might have been constituted for a laudable object but the same by itself would not be a relevant factor for coming to the conclusion that it may impose a tax on mine and mineral or a mineral right.	None
A local authority has no right over the mineral or the mineral right.	None
The power to impose tax upon the said authority by delegation of power or otherwise one mineral right or mine and mineral cannot be bestowed by the State.	None
The power to tax on mineral right cannot be delegated by the State to any other authority.	None
The said power per se does not fall within the purview of Entry 5.	None
The statutory authorities having regard to the provisions contained in Entry 5 may be delegated with the power to impose tax on land and buildings etc. which would have a direct nexus for which such authority has been constituted but not on mineral right which is vested in the State.	None
Nobody questions or has any reason to question the validity of constitution of the authority but what is being questioned is its power to impose tax on mineral right or mines and minerals.	None
Apart from what has been said hereinabove, even the State is denuded of its power to impose any tax on mineral right or mines and minerals having regard to the provisions of the 1957 Act.	None
If it is held otherwise, the same would render India Cement (supra), Central Coalfields Ltd. (supra) and a large number of decisions following the same wholly nugatory.	None
No material has been brought on record to justify the levy of fee or compensatory tax.	None
In any view of the matter, if the State is denuded of its power to levy any tax the validity of the impost cannot be upheld on the ground that thereby a fee or a compensatory tax has been levied.	None
The impost is termed as a cess on mineral right and once the validity thereof cannot be upheld under Entry 50, List II, the invalidated statute would not be validated by changing the subjectmatter of the tax i.e. from mineral right to land.	None
Conceptually fee and tax stand on different footings whereas the element of tax is based on the principle of compulsory exaction the concept of the fee relates to the principle of quid pro quo.	None
The validity of the tax cannot , therefore, be upheld on the ground that the same would be a fee.	None
In any event for the said purpose requisite pleadings in that behalf ought to have been made by the State.	None
The impugned cess, therefore, cannot be upheld by reference to Entry 66 read with Entry 5, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
It is beyond any cavil that the cess levied under SADA Act will have a direct effect on royalty and ultimately the value of the mineral.	None
It is beyond anybodys comprehension that SADA Act can be held to have been validly enacted in terms of Entry 50, List II keeping in view a large number of decisions of this Court, beginning from Hingir Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. (supra), as also several High Courts.	None
(See for example Central Coalfields LTd.	None
(supra)	None
In that view of the matter once levy on mineral right contravenes the limits imposed by the Parliament, the question of upholding its validity in terms of Entry 50 of for that matter in terms of Entry 49, would not arise.	None
No argument has been advaned before us on behalf of the State of U.P. that the activities carried out by the authorities have any direct nexus with the levy of cess on coal.	None
The High Court also did not advert to the said question.	None
Whether there exists any given relation between amount realized and amount spent has not been demonstrated.	None
How and in what manner the doctrine of quid pro quo has been applied had neither been adverted to before us nor the State has shown that substantial amount of the fees realized are spent for special benefits of its payers which was imperative.	None
Furthermore, the decision of the Western Coalfields Limited vs. Special Area Development Authority, Korba and Another (1982) 1 SCC 125 ) cannot be said to be a good law in view of the subsequent decisions of the larger bench of this Court in India Cement (supra).	None
The validity of a provision imposing tax on a mineral cannot be upheld in terms of Entry 5, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India at the instance of a statutory.	None
No material having been brought on record that any services invoking the principles of quid pro quo are rendered to the owners of the mine, the impose cannot also be upheld on the ground that the same is a fee within the meaning of Entry 66, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.	None
It may be noticed that a Division Bench of this Court in Jindal Stripe Ltd. and Another vs. State of Haryana and others (2003) 8 SCC 60 ) referred the question of concept of compensatory tax which had been evolved as an exception to the provisions of Article 301 of the Constitution doubting the propositions of the law enunciated in Shagatram Rajeev Kumar vs. CST (1995 Supp(1) SCC 673) and State of Bihar vs. Bihar Chamber of Commerce (1996) 9 SCC 136).	None
The levy of cess in terms of SADA Act cannot be justified s a fee keeping in view the fact that the tax is sought to be imposed in terms of Entry 50 of the List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
Section 35 of the SADA Act clearly states in no uncertain terms that imposition of tax is subject to the regulation of mines and minerals development.	None
It is, therefore, clearly purported to be a tax in terms of Entry 50 and not a fee nor can it be said to be a tax under Entry 49 List I, in the aforementioned situation.	None
The rules even make no pretence that the tax is imposed on a mineral having regard to the fact that even mineral right has been defined under the Act.	None
The discussions made herein would clearly show that keeping in view the enactments made by the State legislature the rights of the zamindars, tenureholders and intermediaries in mines and minerals had vested in the State, the impugned levy, cannot be upheld.	None
Entry 49 visavis TEA Act, 1953 Sections 10 and 30 of the Tea Act clearly go to show that not only the production of tea by way of manufacture in a factory but also cultivation thereof is under the Union control.	None
The fields of legislature relating to agriculture and imposition of tax on land which, as noticed hereinbefore, belong to the State legislature, have been taken away by Entry 52 List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India read with Article 253 of the Constitution.	None
The levy fact that the preamble refers to an International Treaty itself is a pointer to the fact that the 1953 Act was enacted by the Parliament not only in exercise of its powers conferred on it under List III of the Seventh Schedule but also in terms of List II thereof.	None
It is, thus, not correct to contend, as has been submitted by Mr. Reddy, that by reason by Article 253 of the Constitution of India, the States power is not denuded.	None
Article 253 of the Constitution of India begins with a nonobstante clause and by reason of the said provision the legislative power of the State is taken over by the Parliament and once the field of legislation is taken over (unless the Act is repealed or suitably amended by a Parliamentary Act itself), the State will have no jurisdiction be legislative in relation thereto.

Tea industry is probably the only industry which is not only a controlled industry but also a declared one.	None
It being a controlled and declared industry and the Tea Act being a law referable to Article 253 of the Constitution of India, the States power to make any law dealing with tea including levy of any tax on any types of tea which would include green tea leaves would completely be denuded as a tax either in terms of Entry 14, 18 or 49 would affect the said commodity.	None
In Maganbhai Ishwarbhai Patel vs. Union of India and another (AIR 1969 SC 783 ), this Court held The effect of Article 253 is that if a treaty, agreement or convention with a foreign State deals with a subject within the competence of the State Legislature, the Parliament alone has, notwithstanding Article 246(3), the power to make law to implement the treaty, agreement or convention or any decision made at any international conference, association or other body.	None
In terms, the Article deals with legislative power thereby power is conferred upon the Parliament which it may not otherwise possess.	None
In State of Bihar and others vs. Bihar Chamber of Commerce and others (1996) 9 SCC 136), this Court held The impugned Act is also not relatable to any of the Article 249 to 253 which are in the nature of exceptions to the normal rule that Parliament can make now law with respect to the entries in List II.	None
If so, it follows that the State Legislature are not denued or deprived of their power to make a law either with reference to Entry 52 or with reference to Entry 54 in List II.	None
That power remains untouched and unaffected.	None
All that Parliament has said by enacting the ADE Act is that it will levy additional duties of excise and distribute a part of the proceeds among the States provided the States do not levy taxes on sale or purchase of the scheduled commodities.	None
It is useful to refer at this juncture to Article 249 and 252 of the Constitution of India.	None
Once the Parliament in exercise of its aforementioned jurisdiction takes upon itself the field of legislation which is otherwise exclusively within the domain of the State.	None
The latter is completely denuded of its legislative power.	None
The effect of such Parliamentary legislation would be the same as if the legislation had been enacted by the State Legislature.	None
For the purpose of the Cess Act owner was with reference to a Tea Estate, the possession of which has been transferred by lease or mortgage or otherwise mean the transferee so long as his right to possession subsists.	None
It will, therefore, appear that the cess is levied not on land as a unit by reason of general ownership of land which may belong to a legal owner but the cess may be levied even upon a person who is in possession of a Tea Estate by lease or mortgage or even by a licence or permission.	None
If, for example, the legal owner allows somebody else to be in possession of the Tea Estate temporarily for the purpose of plucking the green tea leave, the cess is levied upon such person not by reason of the general ownership of the land but because he is in temporary possession by a permission or licence.	None
It would be noticed that whereas any house or other buildings do not come within the purview of the definition of immovable properties under the Cess Act, 1880 factories or workshops or housing for the persons employed in the Tea estate had been brought under the impugned Acts.	None
As cess is not payable under the Cess Act, 1880 in respect of land on which building and or factory stands in terms of the charging Section under the impugned Acts, the same would be payable which being selfcontradictory cannot be sustained.	None
Similarly, tea bushes or standing crops, green tea leaves, would also not come within the purview of the definition of immovable property or land as contained in the Cess Act, 1880.	None
It is also doubtful as to whether the Cess Act, 1880 and consequently the impugned levies would to be applicable throughout the State as the levy would be attracted at the places where road and public work cess is payable.	None
The definition of land, immovable property is contained in the Cess Act, 1880 play an important role insofar as in terms of Section 78 of the West Bengal Primary Education Act and Section 4 of the West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act, 1976, cess would be levied on all immovable properties on which road and public work cesses are assessed.	None
Section 5 of the Cess Act, 1880 provides that all immovable properties to be liable to road cess and public works cess.	None
The immovable property which is, therefore, not liable to a road cess and public works cess, a fortiorari, cannot be subjected to education cess or rural employment cess.	None
In Buxa Dooars (supra) primary education cess and rural employment cess levied on tea had been held to be ultra vires Article 301 of the Constitution of India.	None
The said decision applies in all fours in the present case.	None
In Buxa Dooars (supra) it was not necessary for this Court to advert to a detailed discussion on Entry 49, List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India having regard to the fact that its finding that in effect and substance the legislation impugned therein related to despatches of tea and, thus, the legislative source was required to be found therefor with reference to some other entry but the State had not been able to show any.	None
Entry 49 of List II was not held applicable as it was found that under the Tea Act the entire legislative field as covered.	None
Goodricke Group	Arguments of Petitioner
Whether the green tea leaves is marketable as such or not does not appear to be of such relevance.	None
Such a contention has also no factual basis.	None
It is conceded at the Bar that some tea estates may not have factories attached thereto and some factories may be functioning independent of any tea estate.	None
Thus, those factories which process green tea leaves into tea would purchase green tea leaves.	None
It is difficult to assume, as has been done by the Bench deciding Goodricke Group (supra) that green tea leaves are not marketable.	None
It proceeded on the basis that green tea leaves has no nexus with the control over production of tea.	None
If it is held that green tea leaves is a raw material for production of tea or use thereof is necessary for processing, it, the same would be a marketable commodity.	None
It appears that the Tea Board had made a scheme for grant of price subsidy to the small owners which would also be a pointer to the fact that the Tea Board exercised its control over green tea leaves.	None
In Goodricke Group (supra) it has, thus, wrongly been recorded that generally speaking no tea estate market green tea leaves.	None
The writ petitioners have stated that there are about 50 Bought leaf factories in West Bengal.	None
Bought Leaf Factories function within a statutory scheme, viz.	None
Tea (Marketing) Control) Order, 2003.	None
Furthermore, once it is found that the definition of tea both in the Tea Act and the impugned Acts is the same, the court cannot keep the effect of Sections 25 and 30 of the Act out of its consideration for the purpose of ascertaining the true scope and purport thereof.	None
It is relevant to note that in Goodricke Group (supra), not opinion was expressed on Section 25 of the Act or the notification dated 30.10.1986 issued thereunder.	None
Once it it conceded that green tea leaves would come within the purview of definition of tea, it is inconceivable as to how impost of excise duty on tea in terms of subsection (2) of Section 25 of the Act will have no bearing on the subject.	None
By reason of subsection (2) of Section 25, additional excise duty is levied.	None
Excise duty in terms of the Central Excise Act.	None
It fis trite, can not only be levied on finished products but also the products at intermediary stages.	None
Unfortunately, in Goodrickes case (supra), the learned Judges did not consider the matter from this angle.	None
Goodricke also runs counter to India Cement as also Kannadasan.	None
Effect of the expression immovable property in Cess Act, 1880 was also not brought to it notice and had the same been done, there would not have been a conclusion that tea estate would be treated as an unit as therefrom the standing crops and structures were required to be excluded.	None
Goodricke Group of case does not, therefore, lay down a good law and should be overruled.	None
Interpretation in the Light of International Treaties It is true that the doctrine of Monism as prevailing in the European countries does not prevail in India.	None
The doctrine of Dualism is applicable.	None
But, where the municipal law does not limit the extent of the statute, even if India is not a signatory to the relevant International Treaty or Covenant, the Supreme Court in a large number of cases interpreted the statutes keeping in view the same.	None
A treaty entered into by India cannot become law of the land and it cannot be implemented unless Parliament passes a law as required under Art.	None
253.	None
The executive in India can enter into any Treaty be it bilateral or multilateral with any other country or countries.	None
As regard Article 253 visavis Article 51 of the Constitution, we may notice that in the case of Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala (1973) 4 SCC 225 ).	None
Sikri CJ referred to Art.	None
51 in the following words	None
It seems to me that, in view of Art.	None
51 of the Directive Principles, this Court must interpret language of the Constitution, if not intractable, which is after all a Municipal Law, in the light of the United Nations Charter and solemn declarations subscribed to by India.	None
The learned Chief Justice also relied on the observation made by Lord Denning in Corocraft vs. Ram American Airways (1969) All ER 82), that it is the duty of the courts to construe our legislation so as to be conformity with International Law and not in conflict with it.	None
It is the one thing to say that legislation may be interpreted in conformity with international principles but is entirely a different thing to give effect to a treaty provision in the absence of Municipal Laws.	None
In Reference by President of India (AIR 1960 SC 845 ), it has been held that cession of National territory involve a foreign state which can be done by the Central Government in exercise of its treaty making power.	None

It has been held The meaning and content of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution of India are of sufficient amplitude to encompass all the facets of gender equality including prevention of sexual harassment or abuse.	None
Independence of judiciary forms a part of our constitutional scheme.	None
The international conventions and norms are to be read into them in the absence of enacted domestic law occupying the field when there is no inconsistency between them.	None
It is now an accepted rule of judicial construction that regard must be had to international conventions and norms for construing domestic law when there is no inconsistency between them and there is a void in the domestic law.	None
The High Court of Australia in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs vs. Teoh (128 Aus LR 353) has recognised the concept of legitimate expectation of its observance in the absence of a contrary legislative provision, even in the absence of a Bill of Rights in the Constitution of Australia.

Measure of Tax It is no longer in dispute that for the purpose of determining the nature of tax, the measure with reference to which a tax is calculated is a relevant factor although not conclusive.	None
(See R.R. Engineering Co. vs. Zilla Parishad Bareilly (1983) SCC 330, Hingir Rampur Coal Co. Ltd. vs. State of Orissa (1961) 2	Reasoning
SCR 537 , Bombay Tyre International Ltd. vs. Union of India (1984) 1 SCC 467 at 483 para 14, Buxa Doors Tea Co. Ltd. (supra) at 218219 para 10 and 11)	None
In Byramjea Jejibhoy vs. Province of Bombay reported in (I.L.R. (1940) F.C.)	None
it is stated In determining the nature of the tax, consideration may be given to the standard on which tax is levied but that is not the determining fact.	None
The measure of tax is not the sole test.	None
Various decisions cited before us including the 7Judge Bench Judgment in India Cements case lead only to one conclusion that the power of the State to impose tax on land in terms of Entry 49 List II can be exercised when the land is taken as a unit.	None
For the purpose of ascertaining the true nature as also the scope and extent of legislation what is required to be seen is the substance thereof.	None
In Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. vs. State of West Bengal (1989) 3 SCC 211 ) this Court struck down the cess levied under the earlier Acts on each kilogram of tea on the despatches from the tea estate of tea grown therein.	None
This Court held that the standards laid down for measuring the liability under the levy must bear the relationship to the nature of the levy.	None
This Court observed If the levy is regarded as one in respect of tea estates and the measure of the liability is defined in terms of the weight of tea dispatched from the tea estate there must be a nexus between the two indicating a relationship between the levy on the tea estate and the criteria for determining the measure of liability.	None
If there is no nexus at all it can conceivably be inferred that the levy is not what is purports to be.	None
The tea estate comprises of any land used for cultivation of tea or intended to be used for growing plant Camelia Sinensis (L) O. Kuntze and producing green tea leaves from such plant, and shall include land comprising a factory or workshop for producing any variety of the product known as tea made from the leaves of such plant and for housing the persons in the tea estate and other lands which are required for ancillary purposes.	None
In that case, this Court pointed out that the nexus with the tea estate is lost altogether by the provision for exemption or reduction of the levy and that throughout the nexus is confined to despatches of tea rather than related to tea estates.	None
In that case also it was sought to be argued that the cess is a tax on land which is measured by the tea grown in the tea estate and despatched therefrom.	None
This argument was repelled by this Court.	None
According to this Court, there was no relationship or nexus between the tea estate and other lands which are required for ancillary purposes.	None
In that case, this Court pointed out that the nexus with the tea estate is lost altogether by the provision for exemption or reduction of the levy and that throughout the nexus is confined to despatches of tea rather than related to tea estates.	None
In that case also it was sought to be argued that the cess is a tax on land which is measured by the tea grown in the tea estate and despatched therefrom.	None
This argument was repelled by this Court.	None
According to this Court, there was no relationship or nexus between the tea estate and the varied treatment accorded in respect of despatches of different kinds of tea.	None
In the present case also cess has no nexus with tea estate which comprises not only the lands on which the green tea are grown but also the factory or the workshop where the green tea leaves are manufactured into black tea, the houses of the employees where the employees reside, other construction and also on lands which are ancillary to the tea estate.	None
In SC Nawn vs. W.T.O. Calcutta (1969 SCR 108) this Court was considering the validity of the Wealth Tax Act of 1957 on the ground that as if it fell within Entry 49 of List II.	None
It was held that Entry 49 of List II contemplated a levy on land as a unit and the levy must be directly imposed on land and must bear a definite relationship thereto.	None
As the Wealth Tax Act fell under Entry 86 of List I, it was held to be a valid piece of legislation.	None
The said decision has been referred to with approval in India Cement (supra).	None
This Court also referred to the case of Second Gift Tax Officer, Mangalore etc. vs. D.H. Nazareth etc. (1971) (1) SCR 200).	None
In the case this Court held that the tax on gift of land is not a tax imposed directly on land as a unit but only on a particular use, namely the transfer of land by way of gift.	None
In Bhagwan Das Jain vs. Union of India (1981) 2	None
SCR 808 at 816), this Court made a distinction between levy on income from house property which would be an income tax and the levy on the house property itself which would be referable to Entry 49 of List II.	None
Land taxes are imposed in different countries.	None
In the sovereign countries or the countries following the unitary system, the question of conflict in the legislative competence of the Parliament and the State Legislature would not arise.	None
The dispute, however, as to whether the impost in effect and substance is an income tax or tax on land has been the subject matter of various decisions.	None
The said decisions are pointers to the fact that in different countries in different situations levy calculated on the annual value of the land or annual rental value received different considerations at the hands of the courts.	None
In Cooley Taxation Vol.2 Fourth Edition, P. 558 564, t is stated In general  in all jurisdictions real estate situated within the territorial limits of the taxing district is subject to taxation unless exempted either expressly or by implication and by implication is meant the exemption of federal property from state taxation and the exemption of state property from state taxation, etc.	None
Furthermore, the separate estates which different persons may own in the same land, such as where one owns the surface, another the timber growing on it, and still another the mineral underground, may each be subject to taxation.	None
But at Section 564, the learned author states that minerals severed and brought to the surface are taxable as personal property.	None
(Palmer vs. Corwith, 3 Chand.	None
(Wis.) 297), although real estate.	None
(Emphasis supplied)	None
It is, therefore, evident that minerals extracted and brought to the surface would be treated as personal property, and, thus, cannot be the subjectmatter of tax on land.	None
In the London Country Council others vs. The Attorney General, (1901 Law Report, Appeal Cases 26), (which is a converse case) the House of Lords while considering the provisions of incometax payable while repelling a contention that the fundamental distinction between the other schedules and Schedule D, in that the words annual value as introduced into the statute not as the subject to taxation but only as the measure of the taxation to which the property shall be subjected, observed In my opinion, this construction of the section is entirely wrong.	None
Grammatically I think it wrong.	None
I think that the words charged with income tax under Sched.	None
D mean charged under Sched.	None
D with income tax, and the words such tax mean the tax which is called in the Act income tax.	None
It is said that the tax imposed on property within Sched.	None
A is not strictly an income tax, because it is levied on the annual value of property and not on the profits received by the owner.	None
That, no doubt, is so, and if one were writing a treatise on taxation it would be proper to refer to this distinction.	None
But the question is, What do the words income tax mean in the language of the Legislature, and in this Act?	None
(p.44)	None
The learned Law Davey observed Again, it is said (if I understood Mr. Danckwerts rightly) that the expression profits and gains has a technical, or almost technical, meaning as descriptive only of the taxable subjects comprised in Sched.	None
D.	None
No doubt from the nature of the case the words gains is more frequently, though not exclusively, used in Sched.	None
D.	None
But, unluckily for the argument, the word profits is the word selected by the Legislature for describing generally the subjects of taxation under the Income Tax Acts.	None
The title to as well the Act for granting to Her Majesty duties on profits arising from property, professions, trades, and offices.	None
I have already drawn attention to the language of S.102, and to the use of the words profits or gains arising from lands, tenements, hereditaments, and heritages in S.104 of the Act of 1842.	None
The truth is that the income tax is intended to be a tax upon a persons income or annual profits, and although (for conceivable and no doubt goods reasons)	None
it is imposed in respect of the annual value of land, that arrangement is but the means or machinery devised by the Legislature for getting at the profits.	None
(P.45)	None
The aforementioned decision is, therefore, an authority for the proposition that tax calculated on the basis of annual value of land may in a given situation be held to be income tax.	None
Griffith, CJ in Solomon vs. New South Wales Sports Club Ltd. (19 Co. L. Rep. 698) held I am unable to see any reason for thinking that the term land tax has ever been used in New South Wales in any other sense then a tax on land directly imposed by the State.	None
The Supreme Court of United States in Hylton, Plaintiff in Error vs. The United States (US SCR 1 Law.	None
Ed.	None
Dallas 169) while considering a question as to whether a tax upon carriages is a direct tax observed It was, however, obviously the intention of the framers of the constitution, that Congress should possess full power over every species of taxable property, except exports.	None
The term taxes, is generical, and was made use of to vest in Congress plenary authority in all cases of taxation.	None
The general division of taxes is into direct and indirect.	None
Although the latter term is not to be found in the constitution, yet the former necessarily implies it.	None
Indirect stands opposed to direct.	None
There may, perhaps, be an indirect tax on a particular article, that cannot be comprehended within the description of duties, or imposts, or excises, in such case it will be comprised under the general denomination of taxes.	None
For the term tax is the genus, and includes, Direct taxes, Duties, imposts, and excises.	None
All other classes on an indirect kind, and not within any of the classifications enumerated under the proceeding heads.	None
The question occurs, how is such tax to be laid, uniformly or apportionately?	None
The rule of uniformity will apply, because it is an indirect tax, and direct taxes only are to be apportioned.	None
What are direct taxes within the meaning of the constitution?	None
The constitution declares that a capitation tax is a direct tax and both in theory and practice, a tax on land is deemed to be a direct tax.	None
In this way, the terms direct taxes, and capitation and other direct tax 177) are satisfied.	None
It is not necessary to determine, whether a tax on the product of land be a direct or indirect tax.	None
(p.174175) Tax on land must be direct tax, but a tax on mineral severed from land would not be a direct tax.	None
The question has to be considered having regard to the legislative competence as well as the nature of the product.	None
Normally, a tax which is measured in terms of the profit arising out lands being in nature of a tax on income would be a direct tax.	None
A tax, however, which is levied on the product would be an indirect tax.	None
Excise duty is considered to be an indirected tax.	None
When a legislation having regard to the entires in List I provides for imposition of excise duty or additional duty, the same must necessarily be held to be a manufactured a processed product which by necessary implication would be deemed to be not a product of land whereupon a tax by the State can be imposed.	None
In State of Orissa vs. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (1995 Supp.	Reasoning
2 SCC 686) , this Court held The above aspect can be looked at from a different angle also.	None
The Orissa Rural Employment, Education and Production Act, 1992 (Orissa Act 36 of 1992) provided that all lands shall be liable to the payment of tax under the Act.	None
Land is defined in Section 2(c) of the Act to mean, land of whatever description and includes all benefits to arise out of land.	None
Lands held for carrying on mining operations would be taken in by the said definition.	None
It is patently clear that minerals, which are benefits arising out of land, will be roped in within the purview of the levy under Section 3(1) read with Section 2(c) of the Act.	None
So the charging section of the impugned Act imposes a tax on the minerals also and not confined to a levy on land or surface characteristic of the land.	None
Yet another aspect that is selfevident is that for all lands, other than mineralbearing land, the tax is levied as a percentage of the annual value of the land.	None
So far as the tax on mineralbearing land is concerned, it is for the State Government to prescribed the same and it has been so fixed in accordance with Section 3(4)(i) of the Act based on average annual income.	None
As stated in para 3 (supra), by adding Schedule C as per notification dated 26.9.1994 (Annexure B, p.270 of the Paper Book), the rates of tax are fixed for different kinds of minerals per acre, obviously based on average annual income.	None
With regard to coalbearing land, as per Section 3(2)(c), the statute itself has specified the rate of tax in the Schedule at Rs. 32,000 per acre.	None
We have already seen that lands other than mineralbearing lands and coalbearing lands will fall outside the purview of the impugned Act since they are dealt with under the Orissa Cess Act, 1962.	None
It is only the coalbearing land and mineralbearing land, as defined in Section 2(a1) and Section 2(d), which have to bear the brunt of taxation.	None
In the light of the above, we have no doubt in our mind that the substance of the levy under the Orissa Rural Employment, Education and Production Act, 1992 is really on mineralbearing land and coalbearing land.	None
20	None
We have already held that levy of tax under Orissa Act 36 o 1992 is in substance on minerals and mineral rights, which has nothing to do with surface characteristic of the land.	None
In this view of the matter, the levy of tax, on mineralbearing lands and coalbearing lands, under Section 3 read with Section 2(a)(1) and Section 2(d) of the Act is beyond the competence of the State Legislature and is ultra vires.	None
The State of West Bengal had carried out amendments in the impugned Acts after the India Cement (supra) by inserting coal bearing lands instead and in place of coal mines but the definitions of mines within the meaning of several Parliamentary Acts including Mines Act, 1952 and the coal bearing lands are in pari materia.	None
Even the definition of despatch under the impugned Acts and the Parliamentary Acts make no significant difference.	None
We may notice that even in relation to mines and minerals, a cess 0.50 paise per tonne is levied on minerals or materials despatched from the land.	None
These provisions go to show that the materials which are produced on the land, as for example bricks, which can be said to be a material and which has no bearing with the minerals extracted therefrom became the subjectmatter of tax.	None
The impugned Acts do not show that as to how bricks manufactured from the agricultral land by extracting brickearth have a rational connection with the annual value of the land.	None
Measure of tax is an indicia for determining the character and nature of tax.	None
Furthermore whether an impost would be tax on income or grass receipts fell for consideration before the Bombay High Court in Unit Trust of India and Another vs. P.K. Unny and others (2001) 249 ITR 612 ).	None
The High Court, inter alia, framed the following question Whether the interesttax under the Interesttax Act, 1974, is a tax on income and, if so, whether interest accruing to the UTI from loans advanced by it stands exempted in view of section 32 of the UTI Act, 1963.	None
Kapadia, J. (as the learned Judge then was) speaking for the Division Bench noticed that the tax on interest under the Interesttax Act is payable even if there is no income and that it is a tax on gross receipts of interest.	None
The contention raised therein which was negatived by the High Court, inter alia, was that InterestTax Act like Incometax Act also seeks to levy tax on gross receipts and the provisions of the Incometax Act are in pari materia with the provisions of the Interesttax Act.	None
Such a contention was raised having regard to the fact that in terms of the Interesttax Act read with the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India, the burden of such tax would be passed on to the borrowers but CBDT issued a circular disabling UTI from recovering interest tax from the borrowers.	None
It will, therefore, be noticed that measure of tax was considered to be an indicia for determining the nature and character thereof, namely, as to whether such tax is an income or gross receipts of interest.	None
In Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. State of Bihar and others (1983) 4 SCC 45 ), a question arose whether the tax on gross turnover would amount to a tax on income?	None
Gross turnover and gross receipts are relevant for the purpose of determining the income of a person but despite the same, the measure of tax on gross receipts or gross turnover was held to be not an income so as to attract tax on income.	None
These decision, amongst others, is indicative of the fact that the Court has considered the measure of tax for determining the nature thereof.	None
If a tea estate is taken to be a unit and green tea leaves are taken as the measure of tax on land comprising the Tea Estate, as contended, the levy of cess can never be uniform and will have no nexus with the land as the land used for factory, workshop and the houses for persons employed in the tea estate have no contribution to the production of tea leaves which have nexus only with the land where tea plants are grown and which produce green tea leaves.	Reasoning
Apart from this, in a tea estate, there are fallow land, nursery and other areas apart from the factory, workshop, house where cultivation of tea bushes or plant are not possible.	None
By use of the so called measure of production of tea leaves, such lands would remain outside the levy of cess.	None
A distinction exists between a capital value as a measure of tax and capital value as assets.	None
The validity of levy can be upheld where taxes on buildings are levied having regard to a percentage of capital value provided the same is not unreasonable or confiscatory in nature.	None
Municipalities which ordinarily provide for compensatory tax may also be delegated with the power of levying tax or on building the measure whereof may be on the annual value of the building.	None
However, what is converted into income can reasonably be regarded as income.	None
Save and except tax on profession or callings etc. as contained in Article 276 of the Constitution, the State has no legislative competence to impose tax on income.	None
Subject of a tax and the measure of a tax have some relationship to determine the question as regard character of legislation.	None
It is also wellsettled that for the aforementioned purpose only permissible method of valuation can be adopted.	None
Even in D.G. Gose Co. vs. State of Kerala, (1980 (2) SCC 410 ), prima facie it appears such permissible method had not been adopted.	None
The method of valuation for imposition of tax on land or building, furthermore, must be a known one.	None
A mode to calculate tax on the basis of value of a part of land which is itself being taken away or on the basis of annual yield having regard to the definition of tea estate may not be held to be a permissible or known method of valuation.	None
Tax sought to be assessed on the floorage of the building and whence the amount of it is varied according to the number of buildings owned by the person charged has been held to be ultra vires.	None
(See Bhuvaneshwaraiah vs. State (AIR 1965 Mys. 170)	None
The impost having regard to the definition of tea estate may be held to be irrational as the same tea estate may contain a large number of factories, houses and other structures with little open land for tea plantations whereas a tea estate comprising the same area may have tea plantation only with no factory or houses situate thereupon.	None
It is thus evident that the impugned levy has no nexus with land as such but is a tax only on production of tea leaf and hence beyond the competence of the State.	None
There are, thus, several reasons why the nexus between the levy and the measure of the levy is lost in the present case.	None
Green tea leaves which is adopted as the measure of the levy is defined to mean the plucked and unprocessed green leaves of the tea plant.	None
In defining tea estate several categorical of land have been clubbed together.	None
Firstly, there is the land used for producing green tea leaves.	None
Secondly, there is the land intended to be used for growing tea plants (but which is not being so used).	None
Thirdly, there is land comprised in a factory or workshop for producing commercial tea.	None
Fourthly, there is the land comprised in housing estates within the tea estate and fifthly, there are lands used for ancillary purposes (not production of green tea leaves).	None
It is thus seen that the measure of tax is related to the produce of only one portion of the land purported to be defined as the unit of taxation.	None
Additionally, the land comprised in a factory or workshop for producing commercial tea has no nexus whatsoever with the growing of tea plants because by definition, green tea leaves for the purpose of the levy means unprocessed green leaves of the tea plant.	None
The factory and workshop land therefore has no connection whatsoever with the production of green tea leaves.	None
Similarly, the levy on the land used for housing estates and those used for ancillary purposes also have no rational connection with the production of green tea leaves.	None
In any event the productivity or yield value of all the areas of a tea estate other than that portion which is currently being used for cultivation of the tea plants has been totally ignored for the purpose of fixing the alleged measure of tax.	None
Whether the measure of tax provided in the Act bears a rational nexus with the levy itself, has been considered in the case of Buxa Dooars Tea Co. Ltd. (supra).	None
In paras 10 11 of the said Judgment the following propositions have been elucidated The statutory provisions for measuring the liability on account of the levy throws light on the general character of tax.	None
The method of determining the rate of levy would be relevant in considering the character of the levy.	None
The standard on which the tax is levied is a relevant consideration for determining the nature of tax although it could not be regarded as the conclusive in the matter.	None
Any standard which maintain a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis of the assessing the measure of the levy.	None
It is observed It is apparent that the standards laid down for measuring the liability under the levy must bear a relationship to the nature of the levy.	None
In the case before us, we find that the nexus with the tea estate is lost altogether Measure of tax by way of levy of cess must also have a direct nexus with the point of taxation.	None
In the instant case, at is levied on green tea leaves which is produced out of an activity on land and which has no bearing with the tax on land as a unit.	None
Thus, the point at which such tax is levied may also provide for a relevant factor for the purpose of judging the legislative competence of the State.	None
(See Diamond Sugar Mills Ltd. and Another vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh and Another (1961) 3	None

Income Tax Officer, Companies Circle 1(1) Bombay vs. Tata Engineering and Locomotive vs. Ltd. (AIR 1969 SC 319 at 319), this Court held The expression for all purposes, used in S.43 only indicates that when an appointment is made for a particular assessment year it is stood for all purposes as far as that assessment is concerned i.e. for all purposes for imposing tax liability , determining the quantum of the liability and for recovering it.	None
The Expression does not extend the liability to any other assessment excepting the liability for the assessment year for which the appointment is made.	None
In M.K. Kochu Devassay vs. State of Kerala etc. (1979) 2 SCC 117 ), it is stated We find ourselves wholly unable to accept any the contentions.	None
The terms of Section 2 of the 1947 Act as substituted by Section 3 of the Kerala Act are absolutely clear and unambiguous and when they lay down that the expression public servant shall have a particular meaning for the purposes of the Act, that meaning must be given to the expression wherever it occurs in the Act.	None
For the purposes of the Act surely means for the purposes of all and not only some of the provisions of the Act.	None
If the intention was to limit the applicability of the definition of the expression public servant as contended, the language sed would not have been for the purposes of the Act but something like for the purposes of the Act insofar as they relate to the offences under Sections 161 to 165A of the Indian Penal Code.	None
(See also Ashok Leylands vs. State of Tamil Nadu (C.A. Nos. 976979 of 2001 disposed of on 7.1.2004).	None
In Central Coalfields Ltd. (supra), it was held In this case, it is clear that so far as imposition of cess on mines and minerals is concerned, the same has not been levied taking the land as a unit or the annual value thereof, but on the basis of royalty payable on the minerals raised therefrom on on the price of the value of coal raised from the mines which have no direct bearing with the imposition of cess on land as a unit.	None
It was further noticed therein In Commissioner of Incometax, Bangalore vs. B.C. Srinivasa Setty, AIR 1981 SC 972 , the Supreme Court held as follows (at page 975)	None
The character of the computation provisions in each case bears a relationship to the nature of the charge.	None
Thus the charging section and the computation provisions together constitute an integrated code.	None
When there is a case to which the computation provisions cannot apply at all, it is evident that such a case was not intended to fall within the charging section.	None
Proceeded further, the Supreme Court observed (at page 975).	None
It must be borne in mind that the legislative intent is presumed to run uniformly through the entire conspectus of provisions pertaining to each head of income.	None
No doubt there is a qualitative difference between the charging provision and a computation provision.	None
And ordinarily the operation of the charging provision cannot be affected by a construction of a particular computation provision.	None
But the question here is whether it is possible to apply the computation provision at all if a certain interpretation is pressed on the charging provision.	None
The pertains to the fundamental integrality of the statutory scheme provided for each head.	None
(Emphasis supplied)	None
Furthermore, when a provision is laid down in a statute, the same should be construed having regard to the decisions which had been rendered by this Court.	None
In Goodyear India Ltd. vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1990 SC 781 (1990) SCC 71, it was held that taxing statute has to be construed strictly.	None
It was opined that a tax imposed by the State Legislature on despatch on manufactured goods outside its territory is ultra vires.	None
It was further held that It is well settled that while determining the nature of a tax, though the standard or the measure on which the tax is levied may be a relevant consideration, it is not the conclusive consideration.	None
One must have regard to such other matters as decided by the Privy Council in Governor General in Council vs. Province of Madras, AIR 1956 PC 98 (supra), not by the name of tax but to its real nature, its pith and sustance which must determine into what category it falls.	None
In Central Coalfields Ltd. (supra), it was observed From the conspectus of the aforementioned decisions it is therefore, clear that the measure of the tax throws light on the nature of the tax as it may be considered for the purpose of finding out as to whether the impost has any nexus with the tax or not.	None
It is evident that the true character of the levy in Cess Act is that although it appears to be tax on land, in effect, and substance, it is a tax on minerals extracted therefrom.	None
In Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti and others (supra), it was held It is trite that fiscal statute must not only be construed literally, but also strictly.	None
It is further well known that if in terms of the provisions of a penal statute a person becomes liable to follow the provisions thereof it should be clear and unambiguous so as to let him know his legal obligations and liabilities thereunder.	None
The matter may be considered from another angle, Expression unius (persone vel rei)est exclusio alterius, is a well known maxim which means the express intention of one person or thing is the exclusion of another.	None
The said maxim is applicable in the instant case.	None
(See M s. Khemka Co. (Agencies) Pvt. Ltd. etc. vs. State of Maharashtra etc.  (1975) 2 SCC 22 paras 47 and 48).	None
Having regard to the fact that in the event it is held that buying of seeds which is a commodity governed by a Parliamentary Act would attract payment of market fee in terms of the said Act, a conflict would arise.	None
In ordinary parlance at particular stages in which seeds are grown from breeder seeds may take the form of wheat but the said production which is bought by the respondents is also governed by the provisions of the Seeds Act and the Rules framed thereunder.	None
The definition of seed as noticed hereinbefore is of wide amplitude.	None
It includes seedling of food crops.	None
It is, thus, necessary to construe both the statutes harmoniously.	None
Both, the Statutes must be given proper effect and allowed to work in their respective fields.	None
Even if there is some overlappings, the same should be ignored.	None
394.	None
an endeavour, it is trite, shall be made to avoid such a conflict, particular when one of the two possible constructions shall be in consonance with the purport and object of a Parliamentary Act.	None
In District Council of the Jowai Autonomous Distt.	None
vs. Dwet Singh Rymbi (1986) 4 SCC 38 ), royalty imposed on timber removed from private forests was held to be a tax not on land on the ground that the royalty payable has no reference to the extent of land and the nature of land and its potentialities and, thus, a tax on timber which is brought from private forests.	None
It was held The notification in unambiguous terms says that the royalty shall be on the squared log pines.	None
It has no reference to the land on which those trees have grown.	None
In pith and substance it is a tax on forest produce grown on private lands.	None
The District Council has no power to levy such a tax on forest produce under paragraph 8 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution.	None
Reliance was, however, placed on the minority judgment of justice Sarkar in K.T. Moopil Nair vs. State of Kerala in support of the plea that lands on which forests grew could be taxed under entry tax on lands and buildings.	None
The impugned levy being not a tax levied on land as we have pointed out above, the said observation in the above decision is not useful to the appellants.	None
We may add that the very same learned Judge has observed at page 106 that no tax could be levied by a State Legislature on forests and such while tax may be levied on the land on which forests grew.	None
But we are convinced that the levy in question is not a levy on land A distinction must be borne in mind as regard the approved method of valuation for the purpose of imposition of tax on land and building.	None
We should not be under any elusion or suffer any confusion in this behalf.	None
Methods of determining annual value of a land or building is distinct from the value of the mineral bearing land.	None
Annual value of a land or building is determining by applying one or the other approved or known method of valuation, but the same cannot have any application for determination of the total value of the mineral bearing land.	None
The valuation of mineral bearing land would be dependent upon so many factors which would include the geographical condition, quality and quantity of the mineral which can be removed, the capital required to be invested and various other factors.	None
Once the mineral is removed from the mineral bearing land, the surface may not either remain in existence and, thus, the value of the land would gradually come down.	None
The value of a land with minerals and without minerals would be different.	None
As and when mineral is taken out of the land, the value is diminished.	None
The method of imposing tax with reference to the minerals produced from the land, thus, cannot be a criterion for determining the value of the land and, thus, the said method of valuation should not made to apply which is applicable for the purpose of determining the annual value of land or building.	None
This aspect of the matter has again not been considered in Goodricke Group (supra).	None
In Goodricke Group (supra) this Court noticed Ajoy Kumar Mukherjee (supra) and Kunnathat Thathunni Moopil Nair vs. State of Kerala (1961) 3	None
SCR 77 ).	None
It was held It is thus clear from the aforesaid decisions that merely because a tax on land or building is imposed with reference to its income or yield, it does cease to be a tax on land or building.	None
The income or yield of the land building is taken merely as a measure of the tax it does not alter the nature or character of the levy.	Reasoning
It still remains a tax on land or building.	Reasoning
There is no set pattern of levy of tax on lands and buildings  indeed there can be no such standardization.	None
No one can say that a tax under a particular entry must be levied only in a particular manner, which may have been adopted histherto.	Reasoning
The legislature is free to adoppt such method of levy as it chooses and so long as the character of levy remains the same, i.e. within the four corners of the particular entry, no objection can be taken to the method adopted.	None
In the cases before us, the cess is no doubt is calculated on the basis of the yield  for every kilogram of tea leaves produced in a tea estate, a particular cess is levied.	None
But that is a wellaccepted mode of levy of tax on land.	None
The tax is upon the land  upon the tea estate which is classified as a separate category, as a separate unit, for the purpose of levy and assessment of the said cess quantified on the basis or the quantum of produce of the tea estate.	None
It cannot be characterized as a tax on production for that reason.	None
As pointed out in Moopil Nair a tax on land is assessed on the actual or potential productivity of the land sought to be taxed.	None
There cannot be uniform levy unrelated to the quality, character or income yield of the land.	None
Any such levy has been held to be arbitrary and discriminatory.	None
With utmost respect, the approach in the legal situations obtaining herein may not be correct.	None
The said opinion stares on the face of India Cement (supra), Orissa Cement (supra) and P. Kannadasan (supra).	None
India Cement (supra) came to be interpreted correctly in Kannadasan but the same learned Judge appears to have taken a different view in Goodricke Group (supra).	None
The Court therein did not consider the Moopil Nairs case in its proper perspective where a flat rate of tax imposed on lands was held ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution of India.	None
In Moopil Nair (supra), this Court held Ordinarily, a tax on land or land revenue is assessed on the actual or the potential productivity of the land sought to be taxed.	None
In other words, the tax has reference to the income actually made, or which could have been made, with due diligence, and, therefore is levied with due regard to the incidence of the taxation.	None
Under the Act in question we shall take a hypothetical case of number of persons owning and possessing the same area of land.	None
One makes nothing out of the land, because it is arid desert.	None
The second one does not make any income, but could arise some crop after a disproportionately large investment of labour and capital.	None
A third one, in due course of husbandry, is making the land yield just enough to pay for the incidental expenses and labour charges besides land tax or revenue.	None
The fourth is making large profits, because the land is very fertile and capable of yielding good crops.	None
if they could afford the Tax.	None
They cannot afford the tax, the property is liable to be sold, in due process of law, for realisation of the public demand.	None
It is clear, therefore, that inequality is writ large on the Act and is inherent in the very provisions of the taxing section.	None
Moopil Nair (supra), therefore, states about the productivity as a basis for taxation and not the actual production or yield by weight.	None
Yield from year to year would depend on a large number of factors including the expertise and financial health of the company managing the estate, costs incurred in development and maintenance of the garden and many other factors.	None
It would not, therefore, be correct to deduce relying on or on the basis of Moopil Nair (supra) as has been sought to be done in Goodricke Group (supra) that tax on land can be measured by the yield of land and then translate it to the weight of the tea produced.	None
The yield of tea from old tea estates may be qualitatively and quantatively less than the new tea estates Quality and quantity of the yield of tea may not only depend upon the age of the tea plants but also the quality of the land and thus, the the yield both quality or quantitywise would depend upon several factors, namely, quality of the soil, geographical as well as climate conditions and several other factors.	None
As cess has not been imposed on the leasehold in respect of subsoil mineral right visavis surface land as a unit, the impugned tax must be held to be beyond the legislative competence of the State in terms of Entry 49 of List II of the Constitution of India.	None
So far as tea is concerned as even agricultural activities thereof had been taken over and as in terms of Section 30 of the Tea Act the value of tea is to be determined by the Central Government, no tax can be imposed on tea which will have a direct impact on the value thereof.	None
As coal is also an essential commodity in terms of Essential Commodities Act, 1955, its distribution, marketing as also price is regulated and controlled by Colliery Control Order 1945 made under the Essential Commodities Act.	None
As the price of coal is to be determined by the Central Government or the Coal Controller under the Colliery Control Order 1945 which was continued under Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and thus being covered by Entry 33 List III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, no tax on coal can be imposed which will have a direct nexus on the value thereof.	None
The impugned Acts must be construed having regard to the other statutes operating in the field.	None
A statute will not be valid unless the defects pointed out are removed.	None
Such removal of the defects must be done keeping in view the principle of legislative competence.	None
Even the Parliament could not validate an Act which was enacted without proper legislative competence.	None
As the measure of tax levied led to the declaration of the law invalid being in truth and substance to be beyond the competence of the State Legislature by reason of the impugned Acts, the levy cannot be said to have been revalidated.	None
They were required to be reenacted but such reenactment must also be in tune with any or other entries made in List II of the Constitution of India.	None
The definition of mineral is wide.	None
A coal washing plants or cokeoven plants are collieries or coal mines and washed coal, slurry, sludges and cokes of different grades would also come within the definition of coal.	None
Thus, the owners of the industries like cokeoven plants or coal washeries which may be setup either within the precincts of a coal mine or outside the same, would be subject to payment of tax on their products although carrying out such operations is controlled and governed by Parliamentary regulatory statutes.	None
Having regard to the definition of a mine visavis that of immovable property and land contained in Cess Act, 1880, reconciliation of imposition of tax on coal and tea is not possible.	None
By way of example we may notice that coke produced from a cokeoven plant has specifically been included as a subject matter of tax and the weight thereof is measured on the basis that one tonne of coke would be equivalent to 11/2 tonne of coal.	None
Coke is an industrial product, manufactured in cokeoven plants, some of which are highly sophisticated one but even such a material has not been exempted from the purview of the statutory imposts.	None
As any building, factory or standing crops would not come within the purview of definition of immovable property under the Bengal Cess Act, 1880 tea estate as such having regard to its definition cannot be treated to be one unit so as to capable of being levied any land tax.	None
Tax on land is leviable only upon the owner of the and not upon those who have no right thereover.	None
Tea estate as such cannot be treated as a unit under the Bengal Cess Act and consequently under the impugned statutes.	None
I, therefore, am of the opinion that the in the instant case tax has been imposed not on the tea estate as a unit but on the activities of land inasmuch as growing of tea would be such activity which having regard to the provisions of the Tea Act squarely falls within the purview of Entry 52, List I. An Overview of some of the Decisions Operating in the Field	None
We may now briefly consider amongst others the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of different States.	None
In the Anant Mills Co. Ltd. etc. etc. vs. State of Gujarat (AIR 1975 SC 1234 )	None
this Court was considering the validity of the provisions of the conservancy charges levied by Municipal Corporation wherefor classification of property had been made for the purpose of computation of conservancy charges at higher rates on certain special classes of properties like factories, textile mills etc. visavis other properties.	None
The questions which have been raised herein were not raised in that case.	None
The core question which was posed therein was as to whether having regard to the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent Corporation the classification could be upheld on the basis that total expenses to be incurred for conservancy service is required to be found out first whereafter, different rates of conservancy tax fixed for a particular class of property must be related to the cost involved in supply of conservancy service to that class.	None
The Court held that a broad and general estimate of the cost of conservancy service and the tax receipts after taking into account the relevant factors would satisfy the requirement of law.	None
If a broad meaning of land for the purpose of imposition of conservancy tax is required to be given, the same would include mineral which would, empower the State to levy tax on mineral.	None
Such a finding would lead to an absurd result and make Entry 54 of List	None
I otiose.	None
Therein the fact situation was absolutely different insofar as the definition of land contained in Clause 30 of Section 2 of the Corporation Act was wide enough.	None
The Cess Act defines land and immovable property differently.	None
Keeping in view the activities carried on the land itself although the same was beneath the surface, this Court held that the mains buried in the soil being in the possession of the company would come within the purview of the definition of land stating These mains are fixed capital vested in land.	None
The company is in possession of the mains buried in the soil, and so is de facto in possession of that space in the soil which the mains fill, for a purpose beneficial to itself.	None
The decisions are uniform in holding gas companies to be reteable in respect of their mains, although the occupation of such mains may be de facto merely, and without and legal or equitable estate in the land where the mains lie, by force of some statute.	None
In State of Karnataka vs. DriveinEnterprises, (2001 (4) SCC 60 ), it is observed Whereas in the present case, the vires of an enactment is impugned on the ground that the State Legislature lack power to enact such an enactment.	None
What the court is required to ascertain is the true nature and character of such an enactment with reference to the power of the State Legislature to enact such a law.	None
While adjudging the vires of such an enactment, the court must examine the whole enactment, its object, scope and effect of its provision.	None
If on such adjudication it is found that the enactment falls substantially on a matter assigned to the State Legislature, in that event such an enactment must be held to be valid even though nomenclature of such an enactment shows that it is beyond the competence of the State Legislature.	None
In other words, when a levy is challenged, its validity has to be adjudged with reference to the competency of the State Legislature to enact such a law, and while adjudging the matter what is required to be found out is the real character and nature of levy.	None
(emphasis supplied) Imposition of cess calculated on value of coal, tea etc.	None
for the reasons stated hereinbefore has been found to be beyond the legislative competence of the State.	None
Furthermore, it is one thing to say that a land is being used as a hat as was in the case of Ajoy Mukherjee (supra) or forest as was the case of Moopil Nair (supra) but it is another thing to say that a tax is imposed on activities of land confined to extraction of mineral which is clearly beyond the power of the State Legislature.	None
On the same analogy levy of house tax is permissible having regard to the nature and object thereof wherefor there can be a valid classification.	None
The annual valuation of the house on the basis of income must be considered for the purpose of quantifying the tax.	None
But the said principle would not apply in the case of tax on production of minerals.	None
We, having regard to the decisions of this Court in Buxa Dooars and India Cement which are directly on the point, do not think that the approach to the questions involved in the instant case should be different.	None
In imposing tax, having regard to political or economical consideration it may be permissible to allow some concession to the small owners or income arising from the land may be taken into consideration but as would be noticed from the decisions the validity of such taxes have been upheld in relation to the land or the structures standing thereupon or a tax on circumstances and properties.	None
We may notice that in District Board of Farrukhabad vs. Prag Dutt and others (AIR 1948 Allahabad 382) a distinction was made between a tax on circumstances and properties and tax on income saying that the fundamental difference being that income tax can be levied for their own income and if there is no income no tax is payable.	None
But in the case of circumstances and property tax, where a mans status has to be determined his total business turnover may be considered for purposes of taxation, though he may not have earned any taxable income.	None
The question posed therein was considered from the angle that the business turnover may be a relevant factor for determination of mans status.	None
Similarly, in Assistant Commissioner of Urban Land Tax Madras and others etc. vs. Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. etc. (AIR 1970 SC 169 ), it has been held that tax directly imposed on land and buildings must have definite relation thereto.	None
(Emphasis supplied)	None
Herein there does not exist any such relation.	None
In Union Carbide India Ltd. vs. Union of India, (1986 (2) SCC 547 ), the question which arose for consideration was as to whether the Aluminium Cans which are used only for the purpose of manufacturing flashlights, would attract excise duty.	None
The marketability of Aluminium cans came up for consideration for determination of the question as to whether any excise duty can be levied on such aluminium cans and not for any other purpose.	None
We have noticed that green tea leaves are marketable.	None
In D.G. Gose and Co. vs. State of Kerala, (1980 (2) SCC 410 ), while upholding the validity of the Kerala Building Tax Act, this Court considered the nature thereof, namely, it was on recurring tax, observing that the method of fixing annual value on the basis of the figures mentioned in the assessment books of local authorities is valid as adequate procedure for determination thereof had been laid down.	None
The opinion expressed by Singhal, J., with utmost respect is doubtful.	None
Herein, the amount of cess required to be determined on coal and tea will have a direct nexus with the productivity thereof which has got nothing to do with annual valuation of the land as no procedure therefor can be or has been laid down.	None
The mineral is a part of the land and thus price of a mineral, having regard to the decisions of this Court, cannot be said to be a valid method of determination of the annual value of the cost being levied.	None
Under Section 30 of the Tea Act, the Central Government has the power to fix the market price.	None
Fixation of an uniform market price by the Central Government would not be possible if it is held that a different rate of cess can be levied, by different States which will have a direct impact on the sale price thereof.	None
In State of Rajasthan vs. Vatan Medical General Store, 2001(4) SCC 642, this Court upheld the power of the State to make a law with respect to manufacture of intoxicating liquor, which power evidently exists in the State under Entries 8, 1, 6 and 51 List II of Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India read with Article 47 thereof.	None
Having recorded that finding, it was observed that once the act come within the four corners of the State entries, no Central Law made further in terms of List I or List III can be held to be valid.	None
The said decision has no application in instant case.	None
In Ralla Ram vs. Province of East Punjab, (1948 FCR 207), annual value of the buildings and lands was to be ascertained by estimating the gross annual rent at which such land or building with its appurtenances and any furniture that may be left for use or enjoyment with such building might reasonably be expected to let from year to year.	None
In that case, therefore, gross annual rent so fixed or expected reasonable rent was made the criteria, wherefor a procedure had been laid down.	None
It may be noticed that in Ralla Ram (supra), also the Federal Court stated that measure of tax throw light on the general character of the tax.	None
The levy was upheld observing that the encroachment into the federal field is not so great as to characterize it as a colourable piece of legislation.	None
In the instant case, however, as we have noticed hereinbefore that the encroachment of the State Legislation into the Parliamentary Legislation is grave in nature.	None
By reason of the impugned legislation, only the mode of collection of tax has been altered to the effect that instead and place of price of tea and on despatches of coal and tea the same is to be levied on value thereof, excluding the elements of royalty, tax etc.	None
Pithead value of the coal wherefor expenses were required to be incurred which would include the income from the coal mine, whereas value of coal at the points of despatch from coal mine would also include the amount of royalty or other taxes paid thereupon.	None
Thus, the value of coal is to be determined when the same was at the pithead or dispatch would not make any determinative changes in the nature and character of the tax.	None
Nor as indicated hereinbefore, makes any substantial difference in the value of coal.	None
In Ralla Ram (supra) citing Lord Atkin in Gallahagar vs. Lynn it was held It is well established that you are to look at the true nature and character of the legislation,, Russell vs. The Queen, the pith and substance of the legislation.	None
If on the view of the statute as a whole, you find that the substance of the legislation is within the express powers, then it is not invalidated if incidentally it affects matters which are outside the authorized field.	None
The legislation must not under the guise of dealing with one matter in fact encroach upon the forbidden field.	None
Nor are you to look only at the object of the legislator.	None
An Act may have a perfectly lawful object, e.g. to promote the health of the inhabitants, but may seek to achieve that object by invalid methods, e.g. direct prohibition of any trade with a foreign country.	None
In other words, you may certainly consider the clauses of an Act to see whether they are passed in respect of the forbidden subject.	None
In Ajay Kumar Mukherjee vs. Local Board of Barpeta, AIR 1965 SC 1561 , imposition of tax on land used as a market was upheld on the ground that the use to which the land is put, can be taken into account.	None
In the instant case, the use of land is extraction of coal or production of tea.	None
Having regard to the Parliamentary Acts, any tax on the activities of land is forbidden.	None
In the case of Ajay Kumar Mukherjee (supra), the State even could impose tax in terms of Entry 26 of List II as was observed in I.T.C. Ltd. (supra).	None
In Goodricke Group (Supra), Jeevan Reddy, J., in no uncertain terms held that overlapping of two fields may be permissible but the conflict has to be determined having regard to the fact whether it is slight as well as the basis as to whether such overlapping is on fact or is on law.	None
Despite slight overlapping which is permissible, distinctiveness of the nature of the levy under the State Act visavis the Parliamentary Act must exist.	None
However, once an overlapping takes place in law, the State Legislation in view of the declaration made in the Parliamentary Legislations would be unsustainable.	None
Reasoning adopted in Goodricke Group (supra) is contrary to those assigned in Kannadasan (supra).	None
In H.R.S. Murthy (supra), the argument that the expression Royalty does not signify royalty as commonly understood but was confined to the rent payable for the beneficial use of the surface of the land was repelled stating It is therefore obvious that royalty which follows the expression lease amount is something other than the return to the lessor or licensor for the use of the land surface and represents as it normally connotes the payment made for the materials or minerals won from the land.	None
In India Cement (supra), Murthy was overruled holding that therein this Court did not notice Section 9(2) of 1957 Act.	None
It was held that there is a clear distinction between tax levied directly on land and tax on income arising from land.	None
In New Manek Chowk Spinning Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. vs. Municipal Corporation of the City of Allahabad, (1967) 2	None
SCR 679 ) at 696) this Court after referring to the several decisions observed that Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule only permitted levy of tax on land and building.	None
It did not permit the levy of tax on machinery contents (sic) in or situated on the building even though the machinery was there for the use of the building for a particular purpose.	None
Similar view has been taken recently in Krishna Mohan (P) Ltd. (supra).	None
Referring to a large number of decisions, some of which have been noticed herein in before, this Court in India Cement (supra) held that as no tax was leviable under the Act impugned therein, if no mining activities were carried on hence, it was manifest that the same was not related to land as a unit which was the only method of valuation of land under Entry 49, the tax being related to minerals extracted and thus was held to be bad in law.	None
It was held royalty is payable on a proportionate basis of the minerals extracted.	None
It may be mentioned that the Act does not use dead rent as a basis on which land is to be valued.	None
Royalty may not be the produce of the land or the yield of the land, but it is directly linked with the income of the land or the value of the minerals extracted.	None
In Orissa Cement (supra), Section 5(2) of the Orissa Cess Act, 1962 read as follows The rate per year at which such cess shall be levied be (a) in case of lands held for carrying on mining operations in relation to any mineral, on such per centum of the annual value of the said land as specified against that mineral in Schedule II In Orissa Cement (supra), therefore, annual value was to be determined not only on the basis of royalty but also on the basis of the dead rent.	None
Even then, Section 5(2) of the said	None
Act was declared ultra vires.	None
(See also Federation of Mining Association (supra).	None
Only because cess is levied on annual rental value, the same by itself would not be determinative of the character of the levy.	None
Royalty levied on the mineral under Section 9 of the 1957 Act must be held to have a direct relation with the income derived from the mineral bearing land.	None
Royalty is measured in terms of the amount of coal extracted.	None
The value of the coal will, thus, have a direct nexus on the royalty being the lessors share on the demised land.	None
Thus, any tax imposed on extracted minerals would be prohibited as the same will have an adverse effect impact on the mineral development.	None
For levying any tax on land in terms of Entry 49 of List II, it must have a direct bearing on the land as a unit.	None
Any attempt on the part of the State to impose tax on mineral or tea indirectly may not be construed to be a simple overlapping on the subject but overlapping in law having a direct bearing on the competing entries contained in different lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.	None
India Cement has approved Buckingham and Carnatic Co. Ltd. (supra) which is an authority for the aforementioned proposition but the same was sought to be distinguished in Goodrickes case, only on the premise that therein the levy was on the tea estate.	None
In Goodricke Group (Supra), the Court held not take into consideration the question that the power to levy any cess on tea has been taken away in view of the Parliamentary Legislation having regard to Article 253 of the Constitution of India.	None
Goodricke Group Ltd. (supra), thus, with utmost respect, cannot be said to have laid down the correct law.	None
The State is denuded of its power to levy and tax on Tea whether processed or unprocessed as tax imposed thereupon will have a direct impact on the power of the Union Government to fix the value thereof.	None
However, the same does not mean the State cannot impose any tax on the land.	None
It can but the same must conform to its legislative competence visavis relevant entries of List I. Conclusion Under the Nationalization Acts, except some collieries which belong to the companies engaged in the business of manufacture of steel, all other mines for all intent and purport belong to the public sector companies which are subsidiaries of Coal India Limited.	None
It will be a matter of great concern if the price of coal becomes higher in the State of West Bengal than in other States.	None
Despite India Cement (supra) and Orissa Cement (supra) as also various decisions of this Court, tax has not been imposed taking the land as unit.	None
An endeavour has been made to levy cess only by changing the measures thereof.	None
The State has not taken recourse to measures for removing the deficiencies in the Acts pointed out by this Court.	None
By reason of the impugned amendment, the State could not have ignored various decisions of this Court, as has been pointed out in the Workmen of M s. Firestone Tyre Rubber Co. of India P. Ltd. and others vs. The Management and others (AIR 1973 SC 1227 ) wherein it was held that despite insertion of the proviso appended to Section 11A of the Industrial Disputes Act the right of the employer to adduce evidence justifying his action for the first time in such a case is not taken away by the proviso to	None
Section 11A.	None
It was held that legal position as existing prior thereto and changes thereby shall continue stating Another aspect to be borne in mind will be that there has been a long chain of decisions of this Court, referred to exhaustively earlier, laying down various principles in relation to adjudication of disputes by industrial courts arising out of orders of discharge or dismissal.	None
Therefore, it will have to be found from the words of the section whether it has altered the entire law, as laid down by the decisions, and if so, whether there is a clear expression of that intention in the language of the Section.	None
A Bench of this Court in Dharam Dutt and others vs. Union of India and others (2003 (10) SCALE 141 ) observed Welfare Association A.R.P. Maharashtra and another vs. Ranjit P. Gohil and others, JT 2003(2)	None
SC 335 , is a decision to which both of us are parties.	None
Therein we have held that it is permissible for the legislature, subject to its legislative competence otherwise, to enact a law which will withdraw or fundamentally alter the very basis on which a judicial pronouncement has proceeded and create a situation which, if it had existed earlier, the Court would not made the pronouncement.	None

vs. Union of India and Anr.	None
(2003) 4 SCC 399 , in the leading opinion recorded by M.B. Shah, J. (the other two learned Judges having also recorded their separate but concurring opinions), the legal position has been summarized thus the Legislature can change the basis on which a decision is rendered by this Court and change the law in general.	None
However, this power can be exercised subject to constitutional provisions, particularly legislative competence and if it is violative of fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, such law would be void as provided under Article 13 of the Constitution.	None
The legislature also cannot declare any decision of a Court of law to be void or of no effect.	None
Keeping in view that the State has no legislative competence to impose cess on mineral, the ratio of the said decision shall apply in the instant case also.	None
This Court while interpreting binding judgments cannot in effect and substance overrule the same or read down the principles of law enunciated therein.	None
Summary of our Findings(i) The federalisim under the Indian context points out to the supremacy of the Parliament and the legislative entries contained in different Lists of the Seventh Schedule must be construed accordingly.(ii)	None
The interpretation of the legislation will depend upon the legislative entries to which it relates and intent and purport of the makers of the Constitution and no principles of interpretation can be introduced to the effect that the Court should lean towards a State.(iii) Tea and coal being subjects of great importance, the Parliament have taken over the complete control of the entire field in respect thereof and other minerals in terms of the Tea Act, 1953 and Mines and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act respectively.(iv)	None
Having regard to the purport and object of the said Parliamentary Acts and the declarations contained in Section 2 of the 1957 Act and the 1952, Act, the State must be held to be denuded of its power to levy any tax on coal or tea, particularly, having regard to the provisions of Sections 9, 9A, 13, 18 and 25 of the 1957 Act and Sections 10, 13, 15, 25 and 30 of the Tea Act.	None
Field of taxation on mineral is also covered by Section 25 of the 1957 Act.	None
The field of taxation under the Tea Act is specifically covered by Section 25 thereof.(v)	None
The State being owner of the minerals and grant of mineral right being controlled by the Parliamentary statute, the State is denuded of its power to impose and tax on mineral right in terms of Entry 50 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India.(vi) Having regard to the underlying object of the 1953 Act and the 1957 Act, even if the doctrine of pith and substance is applied, it may not be possible to hold that the State legislative has only incidentally encroached upon the legislative field occupied by the Parliament.(vii)	Arguments of Respondent
Levy of tax on coal bearing land sand mineral bearing lands where mining operations are being carried out through the process of incline or digging pits is illegal, inasmuch as the underground mining right would be larger in area than the surface	None
right	None
and, thus, it is not possible to uphold the validity of such statute with reference to the extent of the surface right as mineral is being extracted from a larger underground area.	None
Different rights may belong to different persons over the same surface land and similarly different rights may belong to different persons in respect of or our underground rights and the impugned statutes having not made any provision of different method of levy, the impugned statutes are ultra vires.	None
The impugned provisions do not specify who would be liable to pay in relation to different rights and who would be considered to be the owner of the land and to what extent.	None
If the extent of surface land is treated to be the unit, the same having regard to different mining rights granted to different persons over different minerals would all be liable to pay cess although they may not have any right over the surface at all or exercise such right thereover only over a part thereof.	None
As minerals bearing lands cannot be treated as an independent unit in respect of which tax can be invoked, the impugned Acts must be held to be unconstitutional.(viii)	None
Tax on lands and buildings in terms of Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India can be levied on land as a unit and not otherwise.(ix) As green tea leaves is marketable, the decision in Goodricke group (supra) having mainly been rendered on the premise that green tea leaves is not marketable must be held to have passed subsilentio and, thus, does not lay down correct legal position.(x)	None
In view of the definitions of land and immovable property contained in the Bengal Cess Act, 1880, as no road cess of public works cess can be imposed on standing crops or any kind of structures, houses, shops or other buildings which would include factories and workshops for processing tea, no levy by way of cess can be imposed by reason of the impugned Acts neither on the mining leasehold or the tea estate containing standing crops as also houses and buildings.(xi)	None
Measure of a tax although may not be determinative of the nature thereof, the same will play an important role in determining the character thereof particularly keeping in view the purpose and object the Parliamentary Acts seek to achieve.	None
In determining the legislative competence the taxing event also plays an important role.(xii)	None
The Tea Act having been enacted in terms of Entries 10 to 14 of List I as also Article 253 of the Constitution, the State is completely denuded of its legislative power in relation thereto.	None
The expression Tea should be given a broad meaning and Entry 52 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution should be interpreted in relation to tea having regard to the purport and object it seeks to achieve.	None
For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully dissent with the opinion of Brother Lahoti, J. I would dismiss the appeals of the State of West Bengal and allow the writ petitions as also the appeals including C.A. No. 5027 of 2000.	None
