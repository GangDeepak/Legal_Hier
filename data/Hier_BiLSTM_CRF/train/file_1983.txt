Challenge in this Appeal is to the order passed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court dismissing appellants appeal questioning correctness of the order passed by a learned 7th Assistant District Judge at Alipore, 24, Parganas (South).	Issue
By the judgment of the trial court the appellant and its functionaries were held to be liable to pay sum of Rs.1,00,000/ i.e. Rs.50,000/ for harassment of the plaintiffrespondent no.1 in this appeal and Rs.50,000/ for loss of his reputation.	Issue
The High Court upheld the judgment and decree of the trial court.	None
Filtering out unnecessary details the background facts are as follows4.	Facts
Respondent no.1 was an employee of the appellant No.1Board and disciplinary proceeding was initiated against him and a First Information Report (in short the FIR) was lodged against him and others per alleged misconduct and commission of various offences.	Facts
Initially, the respondent No.1 was placed under suspension for alleged acts of misconduct while functioning as the Superintending Engineer, pending investigation drawal and disposal of the disciplinary proceedings against him.	Facts
Since no charge sheet was issued within a period of four months a writ petition was filed by the respondent No.1 for quashing departmental proceedings.	Facts
The writ petition was disposed of directing the Board to issue the charge sheet.	Facts
Accordingly the charge sheet was issued on 17.1.1986 containing 10 charges.	Facts
Respondent No.1 submitted his reply to the said charge sheet inter alia denying and disputing each and all of the charges leveled against him.	Facts
He prayed for permission to inspect certain documents and to take copies thereof.	Facts
Since the said prayer was not accepted, another writ petition was filed on 13.9.1986 before the High Court.	Facts
In the said writ petition order passed by the High Court was with to the effect that the enquiry should continue upon proper inspection being granted to all documents for which inspection had been offered, excepting three items.	Facts
It was further directed that the enquiry should commence after grant of proper opportunity to the respondent no.1 in accordance with law.	Facts
It was, further directed that the enquiry should be completed as expeditiously as possible preferably within six months from the date of commencement of the enquiry.	Facts
Respondent No.1 continued to make grievance about denial of opportunity and on 10th September, 1986 purportedly written statement of defence in reply to the charge sheet was filed.	Facts
By order dated 12th December, 1986, the respondent no.1 was informed that his reply was found unsatisfactorily and it was decided to hold an enquiry.	Facts
Subsequently enquiry officer was appointed and a presenting officer was also appointed.	Facts
However, the enquiry officer appointed originally was replaced because of respondent no.1s allegations of bias.5.	Facts
Another writ petition was filed by the respondent No.1 for quashing the proceedings.	Facts
The High Court directed the appellant to complete the enquiry by 15th May, 1987.	Facts
It was clearly indicated therein that if there is default in completing the enquiry within the stipulated time, it would be presumed that the Board was not interested to proceed with the matter so far as the respondent no.1 is concerned, and the order of suspension would stand quashed.	Facts
On an application moved, the time for completion of the proceeding was extended by two months.	Facts
The enquiry officer concluded the proceeding on 1st June, 1987.	Facts
He submitted the report on June 8, 1987, with the finding that charges Nos.	Facts
I, IV, VI, VII, VIII and IX were not established.	Facts
However, the charges Nos. II, V and X were established while charge No.	Facts
III was partially established.	Facts
Second show cause notice was accordingly issued proposing several punishments.	Facts
A writ petition was filed challenging the enquiry proceeding, enquiry report and the second show cause notice.	Facts
The only ground taking during the hearing of the writ petition was that the respondent No.1 who was the writ petitioner had not been given reasonable opportunity of hearing and thus natural justice was denied to him.	Facts
Further he was not given access to several vital documents.	Facts
It was contended that the findings recorded by the enquiry officer were perverse and no reasonable person could have come to such finding on the basis of materials on record.	Facts
The second show cause notice betrays the complete nonapplication of mind.	Facts
In any event the punishment proposed was disproportionate with the offence alleged to have been established in the enquiry.6.	Facts
The stand of the present appellant opposing the writ petition was that all relevant documents have been produced.	Facts
Respondent No.1 with the sole object of delaying the proceedings had filed writ petitions at different points of time.	Facts
Materials on record clearly established misconduct.	Facts
Therefore, grievances of the writ petitioner cannot be entertained.	Facts
The High Court after considering the rival stand and materials on record ultimately came to hold as follows To sum up the enquiry proceedings were vitiated because the petitioner was not given reasonable opportunity of being heard.	Facts
The petitioner was not given inspection of several vital documents which prejudiced his defence.	Facts
The findings of the Enquiry Officer were vitiated being perverse.	Facts
The punishment proposed to be imposed upon the petitioner was determined without considering the service records of the petitioner which is contrary to the provisions of Regulations 63.	None
The writ petition was accordingly allowed and certain directions were given inter alia directing that the respondent No.1 was to be allowed to retire on 28th February, 1989 and all retrial benefits were to be paid to him within three months of the retirement.	Facts
The reasons for holding the enquiry proceedings vitiated were indicated as follows In that view of the matter no further proceedings shall be initiated against the petitioner.	Facts
The suspension order was issued on 30th July, 1985 and the petitioner had to move this Court twice, firstly for a direction upon the respondents to issue a charge sheet and secondly for completion of the proceedings within a reasonable time.	Facts
The chargesheet was only issued on January, 17, 1986 and the enquiry proceeding was concluded on June 1987.	Facts
The report of the Enquiry officer was submitted on June 6, 1987 and thereafter the impugned second Show cause notice was issued on June 19, 1987.	Facts
On the facts and in view of the findings as aforesaid the order of suspension cannot be sustained and shall stand revoked.	Facts
The petitioner shall be treated as on duty for the entire period of suspension for all purposes.	Facts
He shall be paid all his arrear of salaries after adjustment of subsistence allowance already drawn within two weeks from the date of communication of this order.	Facts
It is not in dispute that the directions given by the High Court in the writ petition have been carried out.	Facts
Subsequently the respondent No. 1 filed a civil suit before the Assistant District Judge, Alipur, claiming damages for the institution of disciplinary proceedings against him by the appellant and also the newspaper which purportedly made publication of certain news items.	Facts
The suit was registered as Money Suit No.3 of 1990 and was subsequently renumbered as Money Suit No.2 of 1995.	Facts
The suit was filed on 12.5.1990.	Facts
After referring to details of the departmental proceedings the following averments in the plaint were made The plaintiff submitted that the defendant had with malafide intention and to lower the Plaintiffs reputation and prestige in the estimation of the public brought false charges against the Plaintiff illegally suspended him from service.	Facts
It has been clearly held by the Honble High Court at Calcutta in C.O. No. 5644(w) of 1987 that it has not only affected his reputation but also visited him with serious civil and pecuniary consequences.	Facts
The plaintiff submits that he has suffered great mental shock on account of such humiliation at the hands of the defendant Nos. 13 after having completed his long spell of a brilliant career in service.	Facts
The Plaintiff had to engage reputed barristers and advocate at different stages of litigation for which the plaintiff had to spend a huge sum of money with much difficulty.	Facts
The plaintiff, therefore, claims Rs.5,00,000/only as compensation for defamation.	Facts
The defendant Nos. 69 have been made parties as they published the defamatory news against the Plaintiff without even trying to ascertain the truth from the plaintiff.	Facts
The defendant Nos. 45 are made parties as they are main instigators in suspending the plaintiff on absolutely false charges.	Facts
The prayer was to the following effect The plaintiff, therefore, prays for a decree jointly and severally against the defendants for A recovery of the sum of Rs.5,00,000/ as compensation of damagesCosts of suitSome other relief or reliefs.	Facts
The trial court decreed the suit inter alia with the following findings The exhibit 12 is the certifies copy of the order dated 13.6.1996 passed by the Honble High Court at Calcutta in C.O. No. 7164(W) of 1986 issued by the Honble Court on the application of the plaintiff.	Facts
In this order it is stated that the learned Government pleader Mr. Narayan Gupta for the Defendant Board submitted that there existed no preliminary enquiry report on the subject covering the alleged misconduct or breach of discipline.	Facts
It is, therefore, clear that without holding preliminary enquiry the plaintiff was suspended and the charges were framed against him.	Facts
In the judgment, exhibit 14, passed on 9.2.89 by the Honble justice Shri Ajit Kumar Sengupta of the Calcutta High Court in C.O. No. 5644(w) of 1987 issued by the Honble Court on the writ application of the plaintiff held that the plaintiff should not have been suspended on the fact of the case.	Facts
It is, therefore highly probable that the probable that the plaintiff was suspended for extraneous reasons.	Facts
The plaintiff respondent No.1 was held entitled to damages of Rs.50,000/ for harassment and another Rs.50,000/ for loss of his reputation.	Facts
Interestingly it was held as follows There are no evidence to say actually who were the officers of the defendant	Facts
No. 1	None
Board abused the power vested in them to put the plaintiff in trouble.	Facts
Practically an individual cannot prove it.	Facts
Only a high power Enquiry can reveal the truth, but this Court is not competent to direct such enquiry.	Facts
There is no evidence to prove that the defendants Nos. 2 and 3 made to publish the fact of the plaintiffs suspension in newspapers.	Facts
For want of evidence the claim against the defendant No.1 West Bengal State Electricity Board and the same is dismissed without cost against the remaining defendants.	Facts
Appeal was filed by the appellant before the Calcutta High Court which as noted above dismissed the appeal.	Facts
Certain observations which are relevant are to the following effect.	None
The said judgment was no doubt relied upon by the learned Judge decreeing the suit.	None
He held that it was highly probable that the plaintiff was suspended for extraneous reasons.	Facts
Technically, it was said that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for defamation.	Facts
We are of the opinion that the newspapers being exonerated from the charges of defamation along with the officers of the Board who were alleged to have forwarded the information to them, does not mean that the Board itself can be relieved from the charge of causing loss of reputation of the Plaintiff.	Facts
Which might take months or years, get back all his arrear pay and seniority.	Facts
But is this a true recompense of all that had happened to him in the meantime?	Facts
If say, he has been under suspension for four years as here, his children will tell their mates in School or College their father is innocent but has been proceeded against wrongfully he will answer at all social gatherings shortly and sympathetic questions about the stage of the disciplinary Enquiry.	Facts
In our opinion, the suit was maintainable and properly decreed.	Reasoning
There can remain no doubt on the basis of the findings of fact that the plaintiff had suffered a grievous wrong.	Reasoning
The limitation in English Courts on the basis of the law prevailing in England do not extend and to the Indian Courts.	Reasoning
Just as a criminal case puts the heavy machinery of the Law against an accused, so does a disciplinary proceeding but the heavy machinery of a State of other authority against the person accused of Service offence.	Reasoning
If the State employer is unable to show that there was any reasonable cause or justification for the proceedings if the findings are found at certain stages to have been even perverse then and in that event, the technical conclusion is, that the employee has been made the victim of a proceeding, the cause for which was not a genuine inquiry into the conduct of the petitioner.	Facts
What the other extraneous cause was if any, would be for the employee to allege and the employer to show as nonexistent.	Reasoning
If no causes is shown, the court is compelled to conclude that the cause was extraneous and not worth bringing out into the open public scrutiny.	Reasoning
The present trend of the law is to allow a remedy if a wrong has been committed.	Reasoning
On that principle also, the plaintiffs suit should lie.	Reasoning
The High Court upheld the award of Rs.50,000/ as damages for harassment by treating the same as damages for malicious prosecution causing harassment by way of mental pain etc.	Reasoning
The award of Rs.50,000/ was for loss of reputation was also upheld.	Facts
In support of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant Board submitted that the whole basis on which the compensations have been awarded are really nonexistent.	Reasoning
The conclusions of the trial judge and the High Court are contrary to the whole foundation of the judgment and decree of the trial court.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the order passed by learned Single Judge in respect of the departmental proceedings there was no observation about the proceedings being mala fide or for extraneous reasons.	Reasoning
Only on the ground that reasonable opportunity was not granted to the employeerespondent No.1, the writ petition filed by him was allowed.	Reasoning
There was no specific averment regarding any malicious prosecution.	Reasoning
The only averment made in the plaint shows that wild allegations were made without any material to substantiate them.	Reasoning
Interestingly the trial court did not frame an issue as to whether there was any malicious prosecution.	Reasoning
No evidence was led even to show that there was any malicious prosecution.	Reasoning
It was rightly noted by the High Court that the trial court had held that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for defamation.	Reasoning
Curiously enough the High Court upheld the award of damages of Rs.50,000/ by coming to the conclusion that the amount appeared to have been awarded as damages for malicious prosecution causing harassment.	Reasoning
The reasons are unfathomable.	Reasoning
In response, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 supported the judgment and decree of the trial court as affirmed by the High Court by the impugned judgment.	Reasoning
According to him an honest officer was being harassed by unnecessary proceedings and the innocence of the respondent no.1 was established by the judgment of the High Court in the writ petition.16.	Reasoning
Malice and Malicious Prosecution as stated in the Advance Law of Lexicon, 3rd Edition by P. Ramanatha Aiyar read as follows Malice  Unlawful intentWill intent to commit an unlawful act or cause harm, Express or actual malice is ill will or spite towards the plaintiff or any indirect or improper motive in the defendants mind at the time of the publication which is his sole or dominant motive for publishing the words complained of.	Reasoning
This must he distinguished from legal malice or malice in law which means publication without law full excuse and does not depend upon the defendants state of mind.	Reasoning
The intent, without justification or excuse, to commit a wrongful act.	Reasoning
II.	Reasoning
Reckless disregard of the law or of a persons legal rights.	Reasoning
Ill will wickedness of heart.	Reasoning
This sense is most typical in non legal contexts.	Reasoning
Malice means in law wrongful intention.	Reasoning
It includes any intent which the law deems wrongful, and which therefore serves as a ground of liability.	Reasoning
Any act done with such an intent is, in the language of the law, malicious, and this legal usage has etymology in its favour.	Reasoning
The Latin malitia means badness, physical or moral  wickedness in disposition or in conduct  not specifically or exclusively illwill or malevolence hence the malice of English law, including all forms of evil purpose.	Reasoning
design, intent, or motive.	Reasoning
But intent is of two kinds, being either immediate or ulterior, the ulterior intent being commonly distinguished as the motive.	Reasoning
The term malice is applied in law to both these forms of intent, and the result is a somewhat puzzling ambiguity which requires careful notice.	Reasoning
When we say that an act is done maliciously, we mean one of the two distinct things.	Reasoning
We mean either that it is done intentionally, or that it is done with some wrongful motive.	Reasoning
Malice in the legal sense imports (I) the absence of all elements of justification, excuse or recognized mitigation, and (2) the presence of either (a) an actual intent to cause the particular harm which is produced or harm of the same general nature, or (b) the wanton and wilful doing of an act with awareness of a plain and strong likelihood that such harm may result.	Reasoning
The Model Penal Code does not use malice because those who formulated the Code had a blind prejudice against the word.	Reasoning
This is very regrettable because it represents a useful concept despite some unfortunate language employed at times in the effort to express it.	Reasoning
Malice in the legal acceptance of the word is not confined to personal spite against individuals but consists in a conscious violation of the law to the prejudice of another.	Reasoning
In its legal sense it means a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse.	Reasoning
Malice, in its legal sense, does not necessarily signily illwill towards a particular individual, but denotes that condition of mind which is manifested by the intentional doing of a wrongful act without just cause or excuse.	Reasoning
Therefore, the law implies malice where one deliberately injures another in an unlawful manner.18.	Reasoning
Malice means an indirect wrong motive.19.	Reasoning
Malice in its legal sense means, malice such as may be assumed from the doing of a wrongful act intentionally but without just cause or excuse, or for want of reasonable or probable cause.20.	Reasoning
Malice, in ordinary common parlance, means illwill against a person and in legal sense, a wrongful act done intentionally, without just cause or reason.	Reasoning
It is a question of motive, intention or state of mind and may be defined as any corrupt or wrong motive or personal spite or ill will.21.	Reasoning
Malice in common law or acceptance means illwill against a person, but in legal sense it means a wrongful act alone intentionally without just cause or excuse.	Reasoning
It signifies an intentional doing of a wrongful act without just cause or excuse or an action determined by an improper motive.22.	Reasoning
MALICE, in common acceptation, means, ill will against a person but in its legal sense, it means, a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse Malice in its common acceptation, is a term involving stint intent of the mind and heart, including the will and has been said to mean a bad mind illwill against a person a wicked or evil state of the mind towards another an evil intent or wish or design to vex or annoy another a wilful intent to do a wrongful act a wish to vex, annoy or injure another person or as intent to do a wrongful act a condition of the mind which shows a heart regardless of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.23.	Reasoning
MALICE means wickedness of purpose, or a spiteful or malevolent design against another a purpose to injure another a design of doing mischief, or any evil design or inclination to do a bad thing, or a reckless disregard to the rights of others, or absence or legal excuse, or any other motive than that of bringing a party to justice.	Reasoning
The meaning of the term malice in English law, his been a question of much difficulty and controversy and those who made through the many disquisitions on the subjects in textbooks and judicial opinions are almost tempted to the conclusion that the meaning varies almost infinitely, and that the only sense which the term can safely be predicated not to have in ant given legal context is that which it has in popular language, viz., spite or illwill.	Reasoning
It certainly has different meanings with respect to responsibility for civil wrongs and responsibility for crime and even with respect to crime it has a different sense according as it is used with reference to murder, libel, or the capacity of an infant to commit crime, expressed by the rule malitia supplet act item.	Reasoning
(Ency. of the Laws of England).	Reasoning
Ordinarily, the absence of reasonable and probable cause in instituting a proceeding which terminates in favour of the plaintiff, would give rise to the inference of malice.	Reasoning
MALICE has been said to mean any wrong or indirect motive but a prosecution is not malicious merely because it is inspired by anger.	Reasoning
However, wrong headed a prosecutor may be, if he honestly thinks that the accused has been guilty of a criminal offence he cannot be initiator of a malicious prosecution.25.	Reasoning
MALICE means the presence of some improper and wrongful motive  that is to say an intend to use the legal process in question for some other than its legally appointed and appropriate purpose.	Reasoning
It means an improper or indirect motive other than a desire to vindicate public justice or a private right.	Reasoning
It need not necessarily be a feeling of enmity, spite or illwill it may be due to a desire to obtain a collateral advantage.26.	Reasoning
MALICE in fact is malue animus indicating that action against a party was actuated by spite or ill will against him or by indirect or improper motives.27.	Reasoning
Malice hatred aversion antipathy enmityRepugnance illwill rancour malevolenceMalignity malignancy.	Reasoning
Hatred is a very general term.	Reasoning
Hatred applies properly to persons.	Reasoning
It seems not absolutely involuntary.	Reasoning
It has its root in passion, and may be checked or stimulated and indulged.	Reasoning
Aversion is strong dislike.	Reasoning
Aversion is a habitual sentiment, and springs from the natural taste or temperament which repels its opposites, as an indolent man has an aversion to industry, or a humane one to cruelty.28.	Reasoning
Antipathy is used of causeless dislike, or at least one of which the cause cannot be defined.	Reasoning
It is found upon supposition or instinctive belief, often utterly gratuitous.	Reasoning
Enmity is the state of persona opposition, whether accompanied by strong personal dislike or not as a bitter enemy.	Reasoning
Repugnance is characteristically employed of acts or courses of action, measures, pursuits, and the like.	Reasoning
Illwill is a settled bias of the disposition.	Reasoning
It is very indefinite, and may be of any degree or strength.	Reasoning
Rancour is a deep seated and lasting feeling of illwill.	Reasoning
It preys upon the very mind of the subject of it.	Reasoning
While enmity may be generous and open, rancour is malignant and private.	Reasoning
Malice is that enmity which can abide its opportunity of injuring its object, and pervert the truth or the right, or go out of its way, or shape course of action, to compass its ends.	Reasoning
Malevolence commences with some idea or evil belonging to and connected with the object and it settles into a permanent hatred of his person and of everything relative to him  (Gogan) Malignity is cruel malevolence, or innate love of harm for the sake of doing it.	Reasoning
It is malice the most energetic, inveterate, and sustained.29.	Reasoning
Malice in fact.	Reasoning
Malice in fact means express malice.	Reasoning
MALICE IN FACT OR ACTUAL MALICE, relates to the actual state or condition of the mind of the person who did the act.	Reasoning
Malice in fact is where the malice is not established by legal presumption or proof of certain facts, but is to be found from the evidence in the case.30.	Reasoning
Malice in fact implies a desire or intention to injure, while malice in law is not necessarily inconsistent with an honest purpose.	Reasoning
Malice in law.	Reasoning
Malice in law means implied malice.	Reasoning
MALICE IN LAW simply means a depraved inclination on the part of a person to disregard the rights of others, which intent is manifested by his injurious acts.31.	Reasoning
Malice in its legal sense means malice such as may be assumed from the doing of a wrongful act intentionally but without just cause or excuse, or for want of reasonable or probable cause.	Reasoning

Reasoning

Malicious abuse of civil proceedings.	Reasoning
In general, a person may utilize any form of legal process without any liability, save liability to pay the costs of proceedings if unsuccessful.	Reasoning
But an action lies for initiating civil proceedings.	Reasoning
Such as action, presentation of a bankruptcy or winding up petition, an unfounded claim to property,	Reasoning
not only unsuccessfully but maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause and resulting in damage to the plaintiff.	Reasoning

Malicious abuse of legal process.	Reasoning
A malicious abuse of legal process consists in the malicious misuse or misapplication of process to accomplish a purpose not warranted or commanded by order of Court  the malicious perversion of a regularly issued process, whereby an improper result is secured.36.	Reasoning
There is a distinction between a malicious use and a malicious abuse of legal process.	Reasoning
An abuse is where the party employs it for some unlawful object  not the purpose which it is intended by the law to effect in other words, a perversion of it.37.	Reasoning
Malicious abuse of process.	Reasoning

Reasoning

A malicious act is an act characterised by a preexisting or an accompanying malicious state of mind.40.	Reasoning
Malicious Prosecution Malice.	Reasoning
Malice means an improper or indirect motive other than a desire to vindicate public justice or a private right.	Reasoning
It need not necessarily be a feeling of enmity, spite or illwill.	Reasoning
It may be due to a desire to obtain a collateral advantage.	Reasoning
The principles to be borne in mind in the case of actions for malicious prosecutions are these Malice is not merely the doing a wrongful act intentionally but it must be established that the defendant was actuated by mains animus, that is to say, by spite of illwill or any indirect or improper motive.	Reasoning
But if the defendant had reasonable or probable cause of launching the criminal prosecution no amount of malice will make him liable for damages.	Reasoning
Reasonable and probable cause must be such as would operate on the mind of a discreet and reasonable man malice and want of reasonable and probable cause.	Reasoning
have reference to the state of the defendants mind at the date of the initiation of criminal proceedings and the onus rests on the plaintiff to prove them.	Reasoning

A prosecution begun in malice, without probable cause to believe that it can succeed and which finally ends in failure.	Reasoning
A prosecution instituted wilfully and purposely, to gain some advantage to the prosecutor or thorough mere wantonness or carelessness, if it be at the same time wrong and unlawful within the knowledge of the actor, and without probable cause.	Reasoning
A prosecution on some charge of crime which is wilful, wanton, or reckless, or against the prosecutors sense of duty and right, or for ends he knows or is bound to know are wrong and against the dictates of public policy.	Reasoning
The term malicious prosecution imports a causeless as well as an illintended prosecution.42.	Reasoning
MALICIOUS PROSECUTION is a prosecution on some charge of crime which is wilful, wanton, or reckless, or against the prosecutors sense of duty and right, or for ends he knows or its bound to know are wrong and against the dictates of public policy.43.	Reasoning
In malicious prosecution there are two essential elements, namely, that no probable cause existed for instituting the prosecution or suit complained of, and that such prosecution or suit terminated in some way favorably to the defendant therein.1.	Reasoning
The institution of a criminal or civil proceeding for an improper purpose and without probable cause.	Reasoning
2.	Reasoning
The cause of action resulting from the institution of such a proceeding.	Reasoning

(Black, 7th Edn., 1999)	None
The distinction between an action for malicious prosecution and an action for abuse of process is that a malicious prosecution consists in maliciously causing process to be issued, whereas an abuse of process is the employment of legal process for some purpose other than that which it was intended by the law to effect  the improper use of a regularly issued process.	Reasoning
For instance, the initiation of vexatious civil proceedings known to be groundless is not abuse of process, but is governed by substantially the same rules as the malicious prosecution of criminal proceedings.	Reasoning

2d Malicious Prosecution S. 2, at 187 (1970).The term malice, as used in the expression malicious prosecution is not to be considered in the sense of spite or hatred against an individual, but of malus animus, and as denoting that the party is actuated by improper and indirect motives.	Reasoning
As a general rule of law, any person is entitled though not always bound to lay before a judicial officer information as to any criminal offence which he has reasonable and probable cause to believe has been committed, with a view to ensuring the arrest, trial, and punishment of the offender.	Reasoning
This principle is thus stated in Lightbodys case, 1882, 9 Rettie, 934.	Reasoning
When it comes to the knowledge of anybody that a crime has been committed a duty is laid on that person as a citizen of the country to state to the authorities what he knows respecting the commission of the crime, and if he states, only what he knows and honestly believes he cannot be subjected to an action of damages merely because it turns out that the person as to whom he has given the information is after all not guilty of the crime.	Reasoning
In such cases to establish liability the pursuer must show that the informant acted from malice, i.e., not in discharge of his public duty but from an illegitimate motive, and must also prove that the statements were made or the information given without any reasonable grounds of belief, or other information given without probable cause and Lord SHAND added (p. 940)	Reasoning
He has not only a duty but a right when the cause affects his own property.	Reasoning
Most criminal prosecutions are conducted by private citizens in the name of the Crown.	Reasoning
This exercise of civic rights constitutes what with reference to the la of libel is termed a privileged occasion but if the right is abused, the person injured thereby is, in certain events, entitled to a remedy.	Reasoning

In other words, it is an act done wrongfully and willfully without reasonable or probable cause, and not necessarily an act done from ill feeling and spite.	Reasoning
It is deliberate act in disregard of the rights of others.	Reasoning
(See State of A.P. v. Govardhanlal Pitti (2003) 4 SCC 739 ).50.	Reasoning
The word malice in common acceptation means and implies spite or ill will.	Reasoning
One redeeming feature in the matter of attributing bias or malice is now well settled that mere general statements will not be sufficient for the purposes of indication of ill will.	Reasoning
There must be cogent evidence available on record.	Reasoning
In the case of Jones Bros. (Hunstanton) Ltd. v. Stevens (1955) 1 QB 275 (1954) 3 All ER 677 (CA), the Court of Appeal has reliance on the decision of Lumley v. Gye (1853) 2 EB 216 22 L.JQB 463 as below For this purpose maliciously means no more than knowingly.	Reasoning
This was distinctly laid down in Lumley v. Gye (1853) 2 EB 216 22 LJQB 463 where Crompton, J. said that it was clear law that a person who wrongfully and maliciously, or, which is the same thing, with notice, interrupts the relation of master and servant by harbouring and keeping the servant after he has quitted his master during his period of service, commits a wrongful act for which he is responsible in law.	Reasoning
Malice in law means the doing of a wrongful act intentionally without just cause or excuse Bromage v. Prosser (1825) 1 CP 673 4 BC 247.	Reasoning
Intentionally refers to the doing of the act it doe not mean that the defendant meant be spiteful, though sometimes, as for instance to rebut a plea of privilage in defamation, malice in fact has to be proved.	Reasoning
(See State of Punjab v. U.K. Khann and others (2001) 2 SCC 330 ).51.	Reasoning
Malice in law.	Reasoning
Malice in law is however, quite different.	Reasoning
Viscount Haldane described it in Shearer Shields, (1914) AC 808 as A person who inflicts an injury upon another person in contravention of the law is not allowed to say that he did so with the innocent mind he is taken to know the law, and he must act within the law.	Reasoning
He may, therefore, be guilty of malice in law, although, so far the state of mind is concerned, he acts ignorantly, and in that sense innocently.	Reasoning
Malice in its legal sense means malice such as may be assumed from the doing of a wrongful act intentionally but without just cause or excuse, or fro want of reasonable or probable cause.	Reasoning
(See S.R. Venkatarcunan v. Union of India (1979) 2 SCC 491 ).52.	Reasoning
Maliceper common law.	Reasoning
Malice in common law or acceptance means ill will against a person, but in legal sense means a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse.	Reasoning

While it is true that legitimate indignation does not fall within the ambit of malicious act, in almost all legal inquiries, intention, as distinguished from motive is the all important factor.	Reasoning
In common parlance, a malicious act has been equated with intentional act without just cause or excuse.	Reasoning

Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Girja Shankar Pant and others.	Reasoning
(2001) 1 SCC 182 ).54.	Reasoning
A bare perusal of the averments made in the plaint show that they are extremely vague, lacking in details and after the learned trial judge held that the Board alone was responsible because it was not established that any individual officer was responsible for it and dispute only have been revealed by the highpower enquiry which the court was incompetent to direct, the award for damages is clearly indefensible.	Reasoning
The High Courts judgment suffers from various infirmities.	Reasoning
Firstly, it has taken a confused view of the matter.	Reasoning
It failed to notice that the trial court itself had held it was highly probable that the plaintiff was suspended for extraneous reasons.	Reasoning
This conclusion is based on surmises and conjectures.	Reasoning
This had not been established.	Reasoning
As noted above, the High Court noted that the Trial Court itself held that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for defamation.	Reasoning
But while affirming the judgment and decree, it held that the damages granted for harassment must be read as damages for malicious prosecution causing harassment.	Reasoning
To say the least, all the conclusions are confusing, contradictory and do not convey any sense.	Reasoning
Looked at from any angle the impugned judgment of the High Court is indefensible and is set aside.55.	Reasoning
The appeal is allowed but without any order as to costs.	Decision
