Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the Judgment and decree passed by the Learned Trial Court dismissing the suit, the original plaintiff appellant herein preferred First Appeal No.241 of 2005 before the High Court.	Facts
That during the pendency of the said appeal, respondent no.1 herein filed an application under section 151 C.P.C. on 19.03.2012 for dismissing the appeal and for directing the appellant herein to vacate the suit property.	Facts

However, the said application came to be dismissed by the High Court on the ground of delay and latches (I.A. No.2244 of 2012).	Facts

Facts
2.8.	None
Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned order passed by the High Court in allowing the review application and deleting para 20 of the judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005, the original plaintiffs have preferred the present appeal.	Facts
Shri A.K. Srivastava, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants has made the following submissions, while assailing the impugned order passed by the High Court passed in the review application.	Arguments of Petitioner
while passing the impugned order, the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction, while exercising the review jurisdiction and has acted beyond the scope and ambit of the review jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC (ii) while exercising the review jurisdiction, the High Court ought not to have set aside the specific finding given with respect to possession, which finding was based on appreciation of evidence before the learned trial Court (iii) the High Court has committed a grave error in deleting para 20 of the final judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No. 241/2005, in exercise of its review jurisdiction inasmuch as, as such, there was no error apparent on the face of the record, which was required to be corrected (iv) merely because the specific issue with respect to possession was not framed by the learned trial Court, cannot be a ground to set aside the finding by the High Court, when such finding with respect to possession was on merits and on appreciation of the evidence before the learned trial Court (v) as such, the High Court has committed a grave error in considering the issues framed in another case being Civil Suit No. 3A/2005, which was related to House No.	Arguments of Petitioner
28/956 and in which the parties were also different.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the High Court has misdirected itself, while considering the issues framed in Civil Suit No. 3A/2005, related to House No. 28/956 and not considering the issues framed in Civil Suit No.	Arguments of Petitioner
4A/2005 (vi) the High Court ought to have appreciated that the issue of possession was at large before the learned trial Court and, in fact, the parties also led evidence with respect to possession.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the High Court ought to have appreciated that there was a specific averment in the plaint as well as in the testimony of the plaintiff that he is in possession of the suit property, i.e., House No. 28/955 (vii) the defendants did not led any evidence with respect to possession.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted therefore that when there were specific averments and pleadings in the plaint in regard to possession, and even the plaintiff led the evidence specifically on the possession, nonframing of the specific issue with respect to possession would not vitiate the finding recorded by the High Court, which was on appreciation of the material on record.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of his submission, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants has relied upon the following decisions of this Court, Sri Gangai Vinayagar Temple v. Meenakshi Ammal (2015) 3 SCC 624 Bhuwan Singh v. Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. (2009) 5 SCC 136 and Sayeda Akhtar v. Abdul Ahad (2003) 7 SCC 52.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that all the parties were aware of the rival cases and the issue with respect to possession was present and even the plaintiffs also led evidence on possession, nonframing of the specific issue with respect to possession would be nonsignificant.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that therefore the High Court has committed a grave error in deleting para 20 of the final judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No. 241/2005 with respect to possession mainly on the ground that no issue was framed by the learned trial Court with respect to possession 3.1 Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants has also taken us to the relevant averments in the plaint as well as the written statement in regard to possession.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has also taken us to the testimony of the plaintiff Shri Ram Sahu, as well as, the deposition of one J.K. Sharma examined on behalf of the plaintiff.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior Advocate has further submitted that there was no crossexamination by the defendants on the point of the plaintiffs possession.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior Advocate has also heavily relied upon the application and affidavit dated 19.03.2012 in which the respondents in an application filed under Section 151 of the CPC specifically prayed to direct the appellants to vacate the suit property.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that therefore, in fact, the respondents admitted the possession of the appellants.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that not only that, but subsequently in the month of September, 2017, the respondents filed a suit against the appellants for decree of possession, compensation and mesne profits.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that therefore, as such, the respondents herein specifically admitted the possession of the appellants in the suit property 3.2	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that the High Court ought to have appreciated that the review application was filed with a malafide intention faced with the proceedings under Section 340 read with Section 195 Cr.P.C and faced with the order passed by the learned Magistrate directing to register the case against respondent nos.	Arguments of Petitioner
1 and 2 herein and others under Sections 193, 465, 471 and 120B of the IPC, dated 06.02.2016 3.3	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that, in fact, the appellants filed an application before the High Court under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC (IA No. 2244/2012) to amend the plaint by adding relief for the grant of decree of permanent injunction restraining the respondents defendants not to dispossess them forcibly.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the said application was opposed by the respondents herein by submitting that they are not threatening to dispossess the appellants during the pendency of the suit.	Arguments of Petitioner
Therefore, the High Court dismissed the said application under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC reserving liberty in favour of the appellants to file a separate suit for the aforesaid relief.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that therefore, as such, the issue with respect to possession was at large even before the High Court 3.4 Learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants has also heavily relied upon the order passed by the learned Magistrate on an application filed under Section 340 read with Section 195 Cr.P.C., in which the learned Magistrate took note of the affidavit dated 19.03.2012 filed by the respondents and also took note of the specific observation and finding with respect to possession made in para 20 of the judgment and order dated 10.12.2013.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that there is a specific finding given by the learned Magistrate on the respondents forging creating concocting the documents to show their possession.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that only thereafter the learned Magistrate directed to register the case against the respondents under Sections 193, 465, 471 and 120B of the IPC, under the provisions of Section 340 Cr.P.C 3.5	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that even subsequently the suit filed by the defendantsrespondents herein, filed in the year 2017, has been dismissed by the High Court on the ground of limitation and the plaint has been rejected in exercise of powers under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC 3.6 Making the above submissions and relying upon the aforesaid decisions, it is prayed to allow the present appeal.	Arguments of Petitioner
4.	None
Shri Punit Jain, Learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondents while opposing the present appeal and supporting the impugned order passed by the High Court has vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court has not committed an error in deleting para 20 of the judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005 in exercise of the review jurisdiction.	Arguments of Respondent
4.1	None
It is submitted that as such the original plaintiff filed the suit seeking cancellation of the sale deed dated 25.03.1995 and permanent injunction to the effect that the defendant nos.	Arguments of Respondent
1 2 (respondents herein) shall not transfer the property to any other person.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that since no injunction from dispossession was sought and only injunction against further transfer was sought no issue was framed in respect of possession.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that therefore in absence of any specific issue framed by the Learned Trial Court in respect of possession of the property and when the suit was dismissed and even thereafter the appeal also came to be dismissed, there was no reason and or occasion for the High Court to make any observation in respect of possession and therefore the High Court has rightly deleted the observations made in para 20 in respect of possession.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that during the lifetime of Shri Ghisa Lal Sahu, he was in possession of the property.	Arguments of Respondent
After his death, his wife Smt.	Arguments of Respondent
Chhimmabai came into possession of the property.	Arguments of Respondent
She continued to be in possession and after her, the adopted son Dilip Kumar Sahu came into possession.	Arguments of Respondent
The issue of adoption of Shri Dilip Kumar Sahu was a subject matter of litigation in Suit No.4A of 2001, where the said adoption and the adoption deed dated 13.05.1992 was challenged.	Arguments of Respondent
The said suit was finally dismissed by the High Court by an order dated 07.09.2009 in SA No.315 of 2005.	Arguments of Respondent
The will setup by the petitioner dated 19.10.1993 was also a subject matter of suit No.45A of 2003 filed by Dilip Kumar Sahu.	Arguments of Respondent
The said suit was decreed by a judgment dated 07.09.2009 in SA No.946 of 2005.	Arguments of Respondent
Some parts of the property was in possession of Tenants (i)	Arguments of Respondent
Om Babu Saxena and (ii) Kashmir Singh Yadav.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Dilip Kumar Sahu got possession from the said tenants on 30.01.1995 by entering into compromises with them.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Dilip Kumar Sahu executed sale deed dated 25.03.1995 in favour of the Respondents.	Arguments of Respondent
Under the said sale, possession of the property was given to the respondents.	Arguments of Respondent
The petitioner got possession of another portion of the property from another tenant Parvesh Singh Jadon pursuant to a judgment and decree dated 18.10.2014.	Arguments of Respondent
The petitioner has not shown as to how, under what capacity and when the petitioner came into possession of the property, constructive or otherwise.	None
4.2 So far as the withdrawal of the application dated 02.12.2013 in I.A. No.1267 of 2012 which was filed by the respondents is concerned, it is submitted that the said application was withdrawn since (i) no relief could have been claimed arising out of a suit initiated by the plaintiffs and (ii) further the portion of the property in possession of the estranged wife of the petitioner Smt.	Arguments of Respondent
Sheela Sahu who was not a party to the said proceedings.	Arguments of Respondent
4.3	None
It is submitted even the application submitted by the petitioner under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC to amend the prayer clause of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from dispossessing the appellants forcibly from the disputed house, came to be dismissed by the High Court, though with a permission to file a separate suit but the petitioners had not filed any instant suit for the aforesaid reliefs.	Arguments of Respondent
4.4	None
It is submitted that therefore when the issue in respect to possession was neither before the Learned Trial Court nor before the High Court and despite the same observations were made in para 20 in respect of possession, subsequently the same has been rightly deleted in exercise of the review jurisdiction.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that the Court has an inherent power to correct the error if subsequently it is bound that some of the observations were made by error.	Arguments of Respondent
By the impugned order the High Court in exercise of powers under Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC has allowed the review petition and has reviewed the judgment and order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005 insofar as deleting the observations made in Para 20 as regards the possession of the disputed property, which were in favour of the appellants original plaintiffs.	Reasoning
From the impugned order passed by the High Court, it appears that the High Court has deleted the observations made in para 20 as regards possession of the plaintiffs mainly solely on the ground that the issue of possession was neither before the Learned Trial Court nor was it before the First Appellate Court and no such issue with respect to possession was framed by the Learned Trial Court.	Reasoning
Therefore, the short question falls for consideration before this Court is, whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the High Court is justified in allowing the review application in exercise of powers under Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC on the aforesaid grounds?	Issue
While considering the aforesaid question, the scope and ambit of the Courts power under Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC is required to be considered and for that few decisions of this Court are required to be referred to.	None
6.1	None
In the case of Haridas Das vs. Usha Rani Banik (Smt.)	Reasoning
and	Issue
Others, (2006) 4 SCC 78 while considering the scope and ambit of Section 114 CPC read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC it is observed and held in paragraph 14 to 18 as under In Meera Bhanja v. Nirmala Kumari Choudhury, (1995) 1 SCC 170 it was held that It is well settled that the review proceedings are not by way of an appeal and have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	None
In connection with the limitation of the powers of the court under Order 47 Rule 1, while dealing with similar jurisdiction available to the High Court while seeking to review the orders under Article 226 of the Constitution, this Court, in Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aribam Pishak Sharma, (1979) 4 SCC 389 speaking through Chinnappa Reddy, J. has made the following pertinent observations It is true there is nothing in Article 226 of the Constitution to preclude the High Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it.	Reasoning
But, there are definitive limits to the exercise of the power of review.	Reasoning
The power of review may be exercised on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record is found, it may also be exercised on any analogous ground.	Reasoning
But, it may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.	Reasoning
That would be the province of a court of appeal.	Reasoning
A power of review is not to be confused with appellate power which may enable an appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court.	Reasoning
A perusal of Order 47 Rule 1 shows that review of a judgment or an order could be sought (a) from the discovery of new and important matters or evidence which after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the applicant (b) such important matter or evidence could not be produced by the applicant at the time when the decree was passed or order made and (c) on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or any other sufficient reason.	Reasoning
In Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aribam Pishak Sharma, AIR 1979 SC 1047 , this Court held that there are definite limits to the exercise of power of review.	Reasoning
In that case, an application under Order 47 Rule 1 read with Section 151 of the Code was filed which was allowed and the order passed by the Judicial Commissioner was set aside and the writ petition was dismissed.	Reasoning
On an appeal to this Court it was held as under (SCC p. 390, para 3)	None
It is true as observed by this Court in Shivdeo Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1963 SC 1909 there is nothing in Article 226 of the Constitution to preclude a High Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it.	Reasoning
But, there are definitive limits to the exercise of the power of review.	Reasoning
The power of review may be exercised on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record is found it may also be exercised on any analogous ground.	Reasoning
But, it may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.	Reasoning
That would be the province of a court of appeal.	Reasoning
A power of review is not to be confused with appellate powers which may enable an appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court.	Reasoning
The judgment in Aribam case has been followed in Meera Bhanja.	Reasoning
In that case, it has been reiterated that an error apparent on the face of the record for acquiring jurisdiction to review must be such an error which may strike one on a mere looking at the record and would not require any longdrawn process of reasoning.	Reasoning
The following observations in connection with an error apparent on the face of the record in Satyanarayan Laxminarayan Hegde v. Millikarjun Bhavanappa Tirumale, AIR 1960 SC 137 were also noted An error which has to be established by a longdrawn process of reasoning on points where there may conceivably be two opinions can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record.	Reasoning
Where an alleged error is far from selfevident and if it can be established, it has to be established, by lengthy and complicated arguments, such an error cannot be cured by a writ of certiorari according to the rule governing the powers of the superior court to issue such a writ.	Reasoning
It is also pertinent to mention the observations of this Court in Parsion Devi v. Sumitri Devi, (1997) 8 SCC 715.	Reasoning
Relying upon the judgments in Aribam and Meera Bhanja it was observed as under Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record.	Reasoning
An error which is not selfevident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the court to exercise its power of review under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Reasoning
In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and corrected.	Reasoning
A review petition, it must be remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an appeal in disguise.	Reasoning
6.2 In the case of Lily Thomas vs. Union of India, (2000) 6 SC 224, it is observed and held that the power of review can be exercised for correction of a mistake but not to substitute a view.	None
Such powers can be exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the exercise of power.	None
It is further observed in the said decision that the words any other sufficient reason appearing in Order 47 Rule 1 CPC must mean a reason sufficient on grounds at least analogous to those specified in the rule as was held in Chhajju Ram vs. Neki, AIR 1922 PC 112 and approved by this Court in Moran Mar Basselios Catholicos vs Most Rev. Mar Poulose Athanasius, AIR 1954 SC 526 .	None
12.3	Reasoning
In the case of Inderchand Jain vs. Motilal, (2009) 14 SCC 663 in paragraphs 7 to 11 it is observed and held as under Section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short the Code) provides for a substantive power of review by a civil court and consequently by the appellate courts.	None
The words subject as aforesaid occurring in Section 114 of the Code mean subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed as appearing in Section 113 thereof and for the said purpose, the procedural conditions contained in Order 47 of the Code must be taken into consideration.	None
Section 114 of the Code although does not prescribe any limitation on the power of the court but such limitations have been provided for in Order 47 of the Code Rule 1 whereof reads as under The power of a civil court to review its judgment decision is traceable in Section 114 CPC.	None
The grounds on which review can be sought are enumerated in Order 47 Rule 1 CPC, which reads as under Application for review of judgment.(1)	None
Any person considering himself aggrieved (a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred, (b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or (c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes, and who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment of the court which passed the decree or made the order.	None
An application for review would lie inter alia when the order suffers from an error apparent on the face of the record and permitting the same to continue would lead to failure of justice.	None
In Rajendra Kumar v. Rambai this Court held (SCC p. 514, para 6)	None
The limitations on exercise of the power of review are well settled.	None
The first and foremost requirement of entertaining a review petition is that the order, review of which is sought, suffers from any error apparent on the face of the order and permitting the order to stand will lead to failure of justice.	None
In the absence of any such error, finality attached to the judgment order cannot be disturbed.	None
The power of review can also be exercised by the court in the event discovery of new and important matter or evidence takes place which despite exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the applicant or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made.	Reasoning
An application for review would also lie if the order has been passed on account of some mistake.	None
Furthermore, an application for review shall also lie for any other sufficient reason.	None
It is beyond any doubt or dispute that the review court does not sit in appeal over its own order.	None
A rehearing of the matter is impermissible in law.	None
It constitutes an exception to the general rule that once a judgment is signed or pronounced, it should not be altered.	None
It is also trite that exercise of inherent jurisdiction is not invoked for reviewing any order.	None
Review is not appeal in disguise.	Reasoning
In Lily Thomas v. Union of India this Court held (SCC p. 251, para 56)	None
It follows, therefore, that the power of review can be exercised for correction of a mistake but not to substitute a view.	None
Such powers can be exercised within the limits of the statute dealing with the exercise of power.	None
The review cannot be treated like an appeal in disguise.	None
The dictionary meaning of the word review is the act of looking, offer something again with a view to correction or improvement.	Reasoning
It cannot be denied that the review is the creation of a statute.	Reasoning
In the case of Patel Narshi Thakershi vs. Pradyumansinghji Arjunsinghji, (1971) 3 SCC 844 , this Court has held that the power of review is not an inherent power.	Reasoning
It must be conferred by law either specifically or by necessary implication.	Reasoning
The review is also not an appeal in disguise.	Reasoning
What can be said to be an error apparent on the face of the proceedings has been dealt with and considered by this Court in the case of T.C. Basappa vs. T.Nagappa, AIR 1954 SC 440 .	Reasoning
It is held that such an error is an error which is a patent error and not a mere wrong decision.	Reasoning
In the case of Hari Vishnu Kamath vs. Ahmad Ishaque, AIR 1955 SC 233 , it is observed as under It is essential that it should be something more than a mere error it must be one which must be manifest on the face of the record.	Reasoning
The real difficulty with reference to this matter, however, is not so much in the statement of the principle as in its application to the facts of a particular case.	Reasoning
When does an error cease to be mere error, and become an error apparent on the face of the record?	Reasoning
Learned counsel on either side were unable to suggest any clearcut rule by which the boundary between the two classes of errors could be demarcated.	Reasoning
8.1	None
In the case of Parsion Devi vs. Sumitri Devi, (Supra) in paragraph 7 to 9 it is observed and held as under It is well settled that review proceedings have to be strictly confined to the ambit and scope of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	None
In Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Govt.	None
of A.P., AIR 1964 SC 1372 this Court opined What, however, we are now concerned with is whether the statement in the order of September 1959 that the case did not involve any substantial question of law is an error apparent on the face of the record).	None
The fact that on the earlier occasion the Court held on an identical state of facts that a substantial question of law arose would not per se be conclusive, for the earlier order itself might be erroneous.	None
Similarly, even if the statement was wrong, it would not follow that it was an error apparent on the face of the record, for there is a distinction which is real, though it might not always be capable of exposition, between a mere erroneous decision and a decision which could be characterised as vitiated by error apparent.	None
A review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereby an erroneous decision is reheard and corrected, but lies only for patent error.	None
Again, in Meera Bhanja v. Nirmala Kumari Choudhury, (1995) 1 SCC 170 while quoting with approval a passage from Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aribam Pishak Sharma (supra) this Court once again held that review proceedings are not by way of an appeal and have to be strictly confined to the scope and ambit of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	None
Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record.	Reasoning
An error which is not selfevident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the court to exercise its power of review under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Reasoning
In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and corrected.	Reasoning
A review petition, it must be remembered has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an appeal in disguise.	Reasoning
8.2 In the case of State of West Bengal and Others vs. Kamal Sengupta and Anr., (2008) 8 SCC 612 , this Court had an occasion to consider what can be said to be mistake or error apparent on the face of record.	None
In para 22 to 35 it is observed and held as under The term mistake or error apparent by its very connotation signifies an error which is evident per se from the record of the case and does not require detailed examination, scrutiny and elucidation either of the facts or the legal position.	None
If an error is not selfevident and detection thereof requires long debate and process of reasoning, it cannot be treated as an error apparent on the face of the record for the purpose of Order 47 Rule 1 CPC or Section 22(3)(f) of the Act.	None
To put it differently an order or decision or judgment cannot be corrected merely because it is erroneous in law or on the ground that a different view could have been taken by the court tribunal on a point of fact or law.	None
In any case, while exercising the power of review, the court tribunal concerned cannot sit in appeal over its judgment decision.	None
We may now notice some of the judicial precedents in which Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC and or Section 22(3)(f) of the Act have been interpreted and limitations on the power of the civil court tribunal to review its judgment decision have been identified.	None
In Rajah Kotagiri Venkata Subbamma Rao v. Rajah Vellanki	None
Venkatrama Rao (18991900) 27 IA 197 the Privy Council interpreted Sections 206 and 623 of the Civil Procedure Code and observed (IA p.205) Section 623 enables any of the parties to apply for a review of any decree on the discovery of new and important matter and evidence, which was not within his knowledge, or could not be produced by him at the time the decree was passed, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason.	None
It is not necessary to decide in this case whether the latter words should be confined to reasons strictly ejusdem generic with those enumerated, as was held in Roy Meghraj v. Beejoy Gobind Burral, ILR (1875) 1 Cal 197.	None
In the opinion of Their Lordships, the ground of amendment must at any rate be something which existed at the date of the decree, and the section does not authorise the review of a decree which was right when it was made on the ground of the happening of some subsequent event.	None
(emphasis added)	None
In Hari Sankar Pal v. Anath Nath Mitter, 1949 FCR 36 a fiveJudge Bench of the Federal Court while considering the question whether the Calcutta High Court was justified in not granting relief to nonappealing party, whose position was similar to that of the successful appellant, held (FCR p.48) That a decision is erroneous in law is certainly no ground for ordering review.	None
If the court has decided a point and decided it erroneously, the error could not be one apparent on the face of the record or even analogous to it.	None
When, however, the court disposes of a case without adverting to or applying its mind to a provision of law which gives it jurisdiction to act in a particular way, that may amount to an error analogous to one apparent on the face of the record sufficient to bring the case within the purview of Order 47 Rule 1, Civil Procedure Code.	None
In Moran Mar Basselios Catholicos v. Mar Poulose Athanasius (supra) this Court interpreted the provisions contained in the Travancore Code of Civil Procedure which are analogous to Order 47 Rule 1 and observed Under the provisions in the Travancore Code of Civil Procedure which is similar in terms to Order 47 Rule 1 of our Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the court of review has only a limited jurisdiction circumscribed by the definitive limits fixed by the language used therein.	None
It may allow a review on three specified grounds, namely, (i) discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the applicants knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed, (ii) mistake or error apparent on the face of the record and (iii) for any other sufficient reason.	None
It has been held by the Judicial Committee that the words any other sufficient reason must mean a reason sufficient on grounds, least analogous to those specified in the rule.	None
In Thungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Govt.	None
of A.P. (supra)	None
it was held that a review is by no means an appeal in disguise whereof an erroneous decision can be corrected.	None
In Parsion Devi v. Sumitri Devi (Supra) it was held as under (SCC p. 716)	None
Under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC a judgment may be open to review inter alia if there is a mistake or an error apparent on the face of the record.	Reasoning
An error which is not selfevident and has to be detected by a process of reasoning, can hardly be said to be an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the court to exercise its power of review under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Reasoning
In exercise of the jurisdiction under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC it is not permissible for an erroneous decision to be reheard and corrected.	Reasoning
There is a clear distinction between an erroneous decision and an error apparent on the face of the record.	None
While the first can be corrected by the higher forum, the latter only can be corrected by exercise of the review jurisdiction.	None
A review petition has a limited purpose and cannot be allowed to be an appeal in disguise.	Reasoning
In Haridas Das v. Usha Rani Banik, (supra) this Court made a reference to the Explanation added to Order 47 by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976 and held In order to appreciate the scope of a review, Section 114 CPC has to be read, but this section does not even adumbrate the ambit of interference expected of the court since it merely states that it may make such order thereon as it thinks fit.	None
The parameters are prescribed in Order 47 CPC and for the purposes of this lis, permit the defendant to press for a rehearing on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the records or for any other sufficient reason.	None
The former part of the rule deals with a situation attributable to the applicant, and the latter to a jural action which is manifestly incorrect or on which two conclusions are not possible.	None
Neither of them postulate a rehearing of the dispute because a party had not highlighted all the aspects of the case or could perhaps have argued them more forcefully and or cited binding precedents to the court and thereby enjoyed a favourable verdict.	None
This is amply evident from the Explanation to Rule 1 of Order 47 which states that the fact that the decision on a question of law on which the judgment of the court is based has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of a superior court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review of such judgment.	None
Where the order in question is appealable the aggrieved party has adequate and efficacious remedy and the court should exercise the power to review its order with the greatest circumspection.	None
In Aribam Tuleshwar Sharma v. Aribam Pishak Sharma (Supra) this Court considered the scope of the High Courts power to review an order passed under Article 226 of the Constitution, referred to an earlier decision in Shivdeo Singh v. State of Punjab (Supra) and observed (Aribam Tuleshwar case (Supra), SCC p. 390, para 3)	None
It is true as observed by this Court in Shivdeo Singh v. State of Punjab (Supra), there is nothing in Article 226 of the Constitution to preclude a High Court from exercising the power of review which inheres in every court of plenary jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave and palpable errors committed by it.	Reasoning
But, there are definitive limits to the exercise of the power of review.	Reasoning
The power of review may be exercised on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence was not within the knowledge of the person seeking the review or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made it may be exercised where some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record is found it may also be exercised on any analogous ground.	Reasoning
But, it may not be exercised on the ground that the decision was erroneous on merits.	Reasoning
That would be the province of a court of appeal.	Reasoning
A power of review is not to be confused with appellate powers which may enable an appellate court to correct all manner of errors committed by the subordinate court.	Reasoning
In K. Ajit Babu v. Union of India, (1997) 6 SCC 473 , it was held that even though Order 47 Rule 1 is strictly not applicable to the tribunals, the principles contained therein have to be extended to them, else there would be no limitation on the power of review and there would be no certainty or finality of a decision.	None
A slightly different view was expressed in Gopabandhu Biswal v. Krishna Chandra Mohanty, (1998) 4 SCC 447 ).	None
In that case it was held that the power of review granted to the tribunals is similar to the power of a civil court under Order 47 Rule 1.	None
In Ajit Kumar Rath v. State of Orissa, (1999) 9 SCC 596 , this Court reiterated that power of review vested in the Tribunal is similar to the one conferred upon a civil court and held (SCC p. 608, paras 3031)	None
The provisions extracted above indicate that the power of review available to the Tribunal is the same as has been given to a court under Section 114 read with Order 47 CPC.	None
The power is not absolute and is hedged in by the restrictions indicated in Order 47.	None
The power can be exercised on the application of a person on the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the order was made.	None
The power can also be exercised on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record or for any other sufficient reason.	None
A review cannot be claimed or asked for merely for a fresh hearing or arguments or correction of an erroneous view taken earlier, that is to say, the power of review can be exercised only for correction of a patent error of law or fact which stares in the face without any elaborate argument being needed for establishing it.	None
It may be pointed out that the expression any other sufficient reason used in Order 47 Rule 1 means a reason sufficiently analogous to those specified in the Rule.	None
Any other attempt, except an attempt to correct an apparent error or an attempt not based on any ground set out in Order 47, would amount to an abuse of the liberty given to the Tribunal under the Act to review its judgment.	None
In State of Haryana v. M.P. Mohla, (2007) 1 SCC 457 this Court held as under (SCC pp.	None
46566, para 27)	None
A review petition filed by the appellants herein was not maintainable.	None
There was no error apparent on the face of the record.	None
The effect of a judgment may have to be considered afresh in a separate proceeding having regard to the subsequent cause of action which might have arisen but the same by itself may not be a ground for filing an application for review.	None
In Gopal Singh v. State Cadre Forest Officers Assn., (2007) 9 SCC 369 this Court held that after rejecting the original application filed by the appellant, there was no justification for the Tribunal to review its order and allow the revision of the appellant.	None
Some of the observations made in that judgment are extracted below (SCC p. 387, para 40)	None
The learned counsel for the State also pointed out that there was no necessity whatsoever on the part of the Tribunal to review its own judgment.	None
Even after the microscopic examination of the judgment of the Tribunal we could not find a single reason in the whole judgment as to how the review was justified and for what reasons.	None
No apparent error on the face of the record was pointed, nor was it discussed.	None
Thereby the Tribunal sat as an appellate authority over its own judgment.	None
This was completely impermissible and we agree with the High Court (Sinha, J.) that the Tribunal has travelled out of its jurisdiction to write a second order in the name of reviewing its own judgment.	None
In fact the learned counsel for the appellant did not address us on this very vital aspect.	None
The principles which can be culled out from the abovenoted judgments are The power of the Tribunal to review its order decision under Section 22(3)(f) of the Act is akin analogous to the power of a civil court under Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	None
The Tribunal can review its decision on either of the grounds enumerated in Order 47 Rule 1 and not otherwise.	None
The expression any other sufficient reason appearing in Order 47 Rule 1 has to be interpreted in the light of other specified grounds.	None
An error which is not selfevident and which can be discovered by a long process of reasoning, cannot be treated as an error apparent on the face of record justifying exercise of power under Section 22(3)(f).	None
An erroneous order decision cannot be corrected in the guise of exercise of power of review.	None
A decision order cannot be reviewed under Section 22(3)(f) on the basis of subsequent decision judgment of a coordinate or larger Bench of the tribunal or of a superior court.	None
While considering an application for review, the tribunal must confine its adjudication with reference to material which was available at the time of initial decision.	None
The happening of some subsequent event or development cannot be taken note of for declaring the initial order decision as vitiated by an error apparent.	None
Mere discovery of new or important matter or evidence is not sufficient ground for review.	None
The party seeking review has also to show that such matter or evidence was not within its knowledge and even after the exercise of due diligence, the same could not be produced before the court tribunal earlier.	None
To appreciate the scope of review, it would be proper for this Court to discuss the object and ambit of Section 114 CPC as the same is a substantive provision for review when a person considering himself aggrieved either by a decree or by an order of Court from which appeal is allowed but no appeal is preferred or where there is no provision for appeal against an order and decree, may apply for review of the decree or order as the case may be in the Court, which may order or pass the decree.	None
From the bare reading of Section 114 CPC, it appears that the said substantive power of review under Section 114 CPC has not laid down any condition as the condition precedent in exercise of power of review nor the said Section imposed any prohibition on the Court for exercising its power to review its decision.	Reasoning
However, an order can be reviewed by a Court only on the prescribed grounds mentioned in Order 47 Rule 1 CPC, which has been elaborately discussed hereinabove.	Reasoning
An application for review is more restricted than that of an appeal and the Court of review has limited jurisdiction as to the definite limit mentioned in Order 47 Rule 1 CPC itself.	Reasoning
The powers of review cannot be exercised as an inherent power nor can an appellate power can be exercised in the guise of power of review.	Reasoning
Considered in the light of the aforesaid settled position, we find that the High Court has clearly overstepped the jurisdiction vested in the Court under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Reasoning
No ground as envisaged under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC has been made out for the purpose of reviewing the observations made in para 20.	Reasoning
It is required to be noted and as evident from para 20, the High Court made observations in para 20 with respect to possession of the plaintiffs on appreciation of evidence on record more particularly the deposition of the plaintiff (PW1) and his witness PW2 and on appreciation of the evidence, the High Court found that the plaintiff is in actual possession of the said house.	Reasoning
Therefore, when the observation with respect to the possession of the plaintiff were made on appreciation of evidence material on record, it cannot be said that there was an error apparent on the face of proceedings which were required to be reviewed in exercise of powers under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Reasoning
At this stage, it is required to be noted that even High Court while making observations in para 20 with respect to plaintiff in possession also took note of the fact that the defendant nos.	Reasoning
1 and 2 respondents herein themselves filed an application being I.A. No.1267 of 2012 which was filed under Section 151 CPC for getting the possession of the disputed house from the appellants and the said application was dismissed as withdrawn.	Reasoning
Therefore, the High Court took note of the fact that even according to the defendant nos.	Reasoning
1 2 the appellants were in possession of the disputed house.	Reasoning
Therefore, in light of the fact situation, the High Court has clearly erred in deleting para 20 in exercise of powers under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC more particularly in the light of the settled preposition of law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid decisions.	Reasoning
Now so far as the submission on behalf of the respondents original defendant nos.	Reasoning
1 2 and the reasons given by the High Court while allowing the review application and deleting para 20 that no issue was framed by the learned Trial Court with respect to possession and or there was no issue before the Learned Trial Court with respect to the possession and therefore the observations made in para 20 with respect to possession of the plaintiff appellant herein was unwarranted and therefore, the same was rightly deleted is concerned first of all on the aforesaid ground the powers under Order 47 Rule 1 could not have been exercised.	Reasoning
At the most, observations made in para 20 can be said to be erroneous decision, though for the reasons stated herein below the same cannot be said to be erroneous decision and as observed hereinabove the said observations were made on appreciation of evidence on record, the aforesaid cannot be a ground to exercise of powers under Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Reasoning
11.1	None
Even otherwise nonframing of the issue with respect to possession would have no bearing and or it fades into insignificance.	Reasoning
It is required to be noted that there were necessary pleadings with respect to possession in the plaint as well as in the written statement.	Reasoning
Even the parties also led the evidence on the possession.	Reasoning
The original plaintiff appellant herein led the evidence with supporting documents to show his possession and to that, there was no crossexamination by the defendants respondents.	Reasoning
The defendants respondents did not lead any evidence to show their possession.	Reasoning
Therefore, the parties were aware of the rival cases.	Reasoning
On a holistic and comprehensive reading of the pleadings and the deposition of PW1 and PW2, it is unescapable that the plaintiff had intendedly, directly and unequivocally raised in its pleadings the question of possession.	Reasoning
As observed hereinabove even in the written statement, the defendants also made an averment with respect to possession.	Reasoning
Thus neither prejudice was caused nor the proceedings can be said to have been vitiated for want of framing the issue.	Reasoning
As observed and held by this Court in the case of Sri Gangai Vinayagar Temple vs. Meenakshi Ammal and Others, (Supra), if the parties are aware of the rival cases, the failure to formally formulate the issue fades into insignificance when an extensive evidence has been recorded without any demur.	Reasoning
Even the observations made by the High Court that there was no issue with respect to possession before the Learned Trial Court and or even before the High Court is not correct.	Reasoning
As observed hereinabove in the pleadings in the plaint and even in the written statement filed by the defendants, there were necessary averments with respect to possession.	Reasoning
Even the parties also led the evidence on possession.	Reasoning
Hence, on the grounds stated in the impugned order, the High Court in exercise of review jurisdiction could not have without sufficient and just reasons reviewed its own judgment and order and deleted the observations made in para 20 with respect to possession.	Reasoning
Even otherwise there is ample material on record to suggest show the possession of the appellants herein original plaintiff.	Reasoning
During the pendency of the appeal the respondents original defendant nos.	Reasoning
1 and 2 filed an application under Section 151 CPC for dismissing the appeal filed by the appellant and for directing the appellant original plaintiff to vacate the suit property.	Reasoning
In the said application filed on 19.03.2012 the respondents original defendant nos.	Reasoning
1 2 never stated that they are in possession of the disputed suit house.	Reasoning
On the contrary, they prayed for an order directing the appellants original plaintiff to vacate the suit property.	Reasoning
The said application for whatever reasons was withdrawn.	Reasoning
During the pendency of the appeal, the appellants filed an application under Order 6 Rule 17 of the CPC by which the appellants sought amendment in the relief clause as regards the issue of permanent injunction restraining the respondents defendant nos.	Reasoning
1 and 2 from dispossessing the appellants forcibly from the disputed house.	Reasoning
The said application was opposed by the respondents original defendants.	Reasoning
It was submitted that the proposed averment is not necessary at the appellate stage as no averments have been pleaded in the application as to why such a prayer is sought belatedly.	Reasoning
It was also submitted that if during the pendency of the suit the plaintiffs have neither been threatened nor have been sought to be dispossessed of the aforesaid property such a prayer at the appellate stage may not be entertained.	Reasoning
The High Court dismissed the said application, not on merits but on the ground that the same was submitted belatedly.	Reasoning
However, the High Court dismissed the said application with the grant of permission to file a separate suit for the aforesaid relief against the defendants.	Reasoning
13.1	Reasoning
At this stage, it is required to be noted that after a period of approximately three years from the date of disposal of the First Appeal 16.04.2005 by the High Court and after the impugned order dated 14.07.2017 passed by the High Court in review application, the defendant nos. 1 and 2 respondents herein in fact filed a separate suit in the Court of Learned Civil Judge, Class I, Gwalior against the appellants herein for receiving possession of the disputed house and compensation, in which the possession of the appellants has been admitted.	Reasoning
In the said suit, it is pleaded that the plaintiffs have sent a legal notice to the said defendants appellants herein, through the Advocate on 09.08.2017 and demanded to vacate the disputed place but have not vacated and handed over the possession of the disputed place.	Reasoning
The sum and substance of the aforesaid discussion is that the High Court has committed a grave error in allowing the review application and deleting the observations made in para 20 of its order dated 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.17.04.2005 in exercise of powers under Section 114 read with Order 47 Rule 1 CPC.	Reasoning
Under the circumstances the impugned order is unsustainable and deserves to be quashed and set aside.	Reasoning
In view of the above and for the reasons stated hereinabove, the appeal is allowed.	Decision
The above impugned order dated 14.07.2017 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Gwalior in Review Petition No.465 of 2015 in First Appeal No.241 of 2005 is hereby quashed and set aside and consequently para 20 of the judgment and order 10.12.2013 passed in First Appeal No.241 of 2005 is hereby restored.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
