 Dua, J. 1.	None
These two appeals (Civil Appeals Nos. 1619 and 1620 of 1968) on certificate by the High Court arise out of the same suit and are directed against a common judgment and decree of the High Court disposing of two crossappeals presented in that Court and will, therefore, be disposed of by one judgment.	None
The principal question canvassed lies within a narrow compass.	Issue
It relates to the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts to entertain and decide the present suit questioning the legality of the notification Ex.	Issue
A13 dated November 2, 1948 reducing the rates of rent in respect of the delta dry ryoti lands in village Kalipatnam under the Madras Estates Land (Reduction of Rent) Act XXX of 1947, (hereafter called the Reduction of Rent Act).	Facts
The trial Court decreed the suit in part but the High Court to which both parties preferred appeals held that the Civil Courts had no Jurisdiction to entertain the suit.	None
It is this short question which requires determination in these appeals.	None
2.	None
It is unnecessary to state at length the past history of the landed estate in question.	Facts
The necessary relevant facts in brief may only be mentioned.	Facts
Shree Raja Kandregula1	Facts
Srinivasa Jagannadha Rao Panthulu Bahadur was the Inamdar of village Kalipatnam in Narsapuram Taluka in the West Godavari District.	Facts
On November 2, 1948, the Government issued a notification (Ex. A13) under Section 3 (2) of the Reduction of Rent Act reducing the rates of rent payable in respect of delta dry ryoti lands in Kalipatnam village.	Facts
The Inam Settlement Officer, Vijayawadha, then took proceedings to determine whether Kalipatnam was an inam estate as defined in Sec.	Facts
2 (7) of the Madras Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act XXVI of 1948.	Facts
After inquiry he made the order dated May 31, 1950 (Ex A1) holding that the suit village was an inam estate.	Facts
Feeling aggrieved by these two orders the appellant instituted the suit, out of which the present appeals arise.	Facts
The short question canvassed before us, as observed earlier, is whether the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to entertain the suit.	None
3. It may be stated at the outset that the appellants counsel conceded at the bar that the question as to the kind of grant can only be decided by the Tribunal appointed under the Reduction of Rent Act and Civil Courts have no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such a controversy.	Arguments of Petitioner
The suit challenging the validity of Ex A1 declaring Kalipatnam village as an inam estate was accordingly conceded to be incompetent.	Arguments of Petitioner
Challenge to Exhibit A1 was thus not pressed in this Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was, however submitted that any finding by the Civil Court on the kind of grant would have to be completely ignored by the Tribunal while considering this question under the Reduction of Rent Act.	None
The submission seems to us to be justified.	None
4.	None
We are thus left only with the relief sought in respect of Ex.	None
A13.	Decision
The appellant questioned the validity of this notification on the ground that it cannot be considered in law to have been made under Section 3 (2) of the Reduction of Rent Act so as to be immune from challenge in the Civil Courts.	None
In order to appreciate and determine this argument it is desirable to turn first to the provisions of the Reduction of Rent Act.	None
This Act was enacted in order to provide for the reduction of rents payable by ryots in estates governed by the Madras Estates Land Act, 1908 approximately to the level of the assessments levied on lands in ryotwari areas in the neighbourhood and for the collection of such rents exclusively by the State Government.	None
The purpose of collection of rent exclusively by the State Government was added in l95l with retrospective effect.	None
The heading of the Act, as originally enacted, was changed, on the creation of Andhra Pradesh to A P. (Andhra Area)	None
Estates Land (Reduction of Rent) Act XXX of 1947.	None
Suitable adaptations necessitated by the creation of the separate Andhra Pradesh were also duly made.	None
Section 2 of this Act which empowers the State Government to appoint a Special Officer for any estate or estates for the purposes of recommending fair and equitable rates of rent for the ryoti land provides as under Appointment of Special Officer to recommend rates of rent in estates.  	None
2 (a) (l)	None
The State Government may appoint a Special Officer for any estate or estates for the purpose of recommending fair and equitable rates of rent for the ryoti land in such estate or estates.	None
(b) The Special Officer so appointed shall also recommend fair and equitable rates of rent for all lands in such estate or estates which became ryoti lands after the commencement of the Act (ii) The Special Officer shall first determine in respect of each village (hereinafter in this section referred to as principal village) in an estate  (a) the average rate of cash rent per acre prevailing at the commencement of this Act for each class of ryoti land which was in existence in the principal village at such commencement, such as wet, dry and garden Provided that where no cash rents are prevalent in the principal village in respect of any class of land, the Special Officer shall determine the average rate of cash rent per acre prevailing at such commencement for such class of land in the nearest village in the estate in which cash rents are prevalent for such class of land and in which conditions are generally similar to those obtaining in the principal village, or where there is no such village in the estate, in the nearest village in the nearest estate in respect of which village both the requirements specified above are satisfied (b) the average rate of assessment per acre prevailing at such commencement in respect of each of the said classes of land in the nearest ryotwari area in which conditions are generally similar to those obtaining in the principal village.	None
(3) The Special Officer shall then compare the average rates of cash rent as determined under clause (a) of subs section (2) with the average rates of assessment as determined under clause (b) of that subsection, and after making due allowance for any difference in the conditions prevailing in the two cases, and also in cases falling under the proviso to clause (a) of subsection (2), for any difference in the conditions prevailing in the village referred to in that proviso and in the principal village determine (i) the extent, if any to which the rates of rent payable for each class of ryoti land in the principal village should in his opinion, be reduced and (ii) the rates of rent payable for each such class of lands after such reduction.	None
Explanation I.	None
The Special Officer shall have power only to determine that the rents payable for any class of ryoti land in the principal village shall be reduced and he shall have no power to determine that such rents shall be enhanced.	None
Explanation II.	None
The extent of reduction, if any, determined by the Special Officer under this subsection shall also apply where rent in the principal village is paid in kind or on the estimated value of a portion of the crop or at rates varying with the crop, whether in cash or in kind, or partly in one of these ways and partly in another, or partly in one or more of these ways and partly in cash.	None
In every such case the Special Officer shall also determine the rent payable, whether in kind or in cash or partly in kind and partly in cash, as the case may be.	None
(31) In the case of lands in an estate which became ryoti lands after the commencement of this Act, the Special Officer shall determine for each class of such lands in the principal village the rates of rent per acre payable thereof under this Act.	None
The rates of rent so determined shall be the same as those fixed under subsee (2) of Section 3 for similar ryoti lands in the same village Provided that where the rates of rent payable in respect of ryoti lands in the principal village have not been fixed under subsection (2) of Sec.	None
3 or where there are no similar ryoti lands in the principal village, the rates of rent so determined shall be the same as those fixed under subsection (2) of Section 3 for similar ryoti lands in the nearest village in the estate, or, if there is no such village in the nearest village in the nearest estate in which conditions are generally similar to those obtaining in the principal village.	None
(4) Where the conditions in a group of two or more villages in an estate are generally similar the Special Officer may perform the functions under subss.	None
(2), (3) and (3A) in respect of such group of villages as a whole, instead of separately in respect of each village in the group.	None
Section 3 so far as relevant for our purpose may now be reproduced.	None

None
5.	None
It is not necessary to reproduce the rest of the sections.	None
Section 7 empowers the State Government to make rules to carry out the purpose of the Act and Section 8 ousts the jurisdiction of the Courts of Law to question the validity of certain orders and proceedings.	None
Section 8 reads as under Validity of certain orders and proceedings not to be questioned 8.	None
The validity of the following orders and proceedings shall not be liable to be questioned in any Court of Law (i) any order made under Section 3, subsection (2) (ii) any recovery of rent effected by the Provincial Government under Section 3, subsection (4) or any payment made by them to the landholder under the same subsection (iia) any order made under sections 3a and 3c (iii) any determination of the net income or average net income or average net income made under Section 5, subsection (2) 6.	None
The precise question requiring decision by us is whether the present suit questioning the validity of the fixation of rent in Ex.	Issue
A13 is excluded from the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts by virtue of Sec. 8 (i).	Issue
There is no dispute that clause (i) is the only relevant clause to be considered in this connection.	None
The appellants learned counsel submitted that the exclusion of jurisdiction of the Civil Courts cannot be extended to orders which were not made in strict compliance with the provisions of Sec. 3 (2) because unless so made they cannot be considered to be hit by Sec. 8 (i).	None
According to the respondents learned counsel, on the other hand, Ex.	None
A13 was made pursuant to the power conferred by Sec. 3 (2) and is therefore covered by Sec. 8 (i).	None
He further submitted that there being a complete machinery provided by the statute itself for challenging the orders made in proceedings taken thereunder, the Civil Courts are precluded from considering the correctness of those orders.	Arguments of Respondent
According to him Sections 3A and 3B provide for rectification of errors committed by the Special Officer and that looking at the statutory scheme it must be held that an order purporting to be made under Sec.	Arguments of Respondent
3 (2) of the Reduction of Rent Act is immune from challenge in the Civil Courts.	Arguments of Respondent
7.	None
The general principle on which the jurisdiction of Civil Courts can successfully be excluded in respect of decisions by special Tribunals is well settled.	None
The difficulty usually arises in its application to given cases.	None
As observed by the Privy Council in Secy. of State v Mask and Co., 67 Ind App 222 (AIR 1940 PC 105 ),the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied.	None
Further even if the jurisdiction is so excluded the Civil Courts have jurisdiction to examine into the cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory Tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.	None
It is unnecessary to refer to other cases dealing with this question.	None
We need only refer to the recent decision of this Court in Dhulabhai v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (1968)	None
3	None
SCR 662 (AIR 1969 SC 78) , in which after an exhaustive discussion of the case law the legal position was summarised by the Court speaking through Hidayatullah C. J. as follows (1) Where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunal the Civil Courts jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what the Civil Courts would normally do in a suit.	None
Such provision, however, does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.	None
(2) Where there is an express bar of the jurisdiction of the court, an examination of the scheme of the particular Act to find the adequacy or the sufficiency of the remedies provided may be relevant but is not decisive to sustain the jurisdiction of the civil court.	None
Where there is no express exclusion the examination of the remedies and the scheme of the particular Act to find out the intendment becomes necessary and the result of the inquiry may be decisive.	None
In the latter case it is necessary to see if the statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right or liability and further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunals so constituted, and whether remedies normally associated with actions in Civil Courts are prescribed by the said statute or not.	None
(3) Challenge to the provisions of the particular Act as ultra vires cannot be brought before Tribunals constituted under that Act.	None
Even the High Court cannot go into that question on a revision or reference from the decision of the Tribunals.	None
(4) When a provision is already declared unconstitutional or the constitutionality of any provision is to be challenged, a suit is open.	None
A writ of certiorari may include a direction for refund if the claim is clearly within the time prescribed by the Limitation Act but it is not a compulsory remedy to replace a suit.	None
(5) Where the particular Act contains no machinery for refund of tax collected in excess of constitutional limits or illegally collected a suit lies.	None
(6) Questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its constitutionality are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or there is an express prohibition in the particular Act.	None
In either case the scheme of the particular Act must be examined because it is relevant enquiry (7) An exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not readily to be inferred unless the conditions above set down apply.	None
8.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the appellants counsel the first proposition covers the present case.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that there is no statutory definition to which one can turn for the purpose of determining wet, dry and garden lands as contemplated by the Reduction of Rent Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
The matter has therefore necessarily to be decided by holding an inquiry into the factual position.	Arguments of Petitioner
This, the counsel argued, was not done.	Arguments of Petitioner
We were taken through the relevant portions of Ex. B24 which is a report from the Special Assistant to the Special Officer for rent reduction.	None
It is observed therein that there are no wet or garden lands in village Kalipatnam and that the entire land is delta dry in which wet paddy is raised under Kalipatnam project channel.	Arguments of Petitioner
The ryots pay to the Government Rs. 5/ per acre by way of water rate.	Reasoning
It was emphasised by the appellants learned counsel that the fact that wet paddy is raised in this land, which is described as delta dry and that water rate is paid to the Government, must conclusively show that the land is not delta dry but wet.	Reasoning
It is the factual position and not bare entry in the settlement register which should be the guiding factor.	Reasoning
Support for this submission was also sought from the recent unreported decision of this Court in O. K. Muthuswamy Mudaliar v. State of Madras, Civil Appeals Nos. 10111016 of 1965, D  3171968 (SC), in which the following observations occur The mere fact that the lands are registered dry does not affect their value.	None
The lands are fertile and are cultivated with wet crop.	Reasoning
They are irrigable with the waters of the river Bhavani.	Reasoning
There is abundant supply of water throughout the year.	Reasoning
The landowners had the right to take water for the irrigation of 400 acres.	Reasoning
9.	None
In this connection the appellants learned counsel also criticised the following observation in the judgment of the High Court In the Statements Ex.	Arguments of Petitioner
B5 and Ex. B6, furnished by the plaintiff himself, the classification of the land is shown as dry though it is also mentioned that the lands were cultivated with double crop of paddy.	Arguments of Petitioner
If a proprietor owns a certain land but does not own the water source from which water is being taken for irrigating that land, he will not be in a position to classify it as wet land for the benefit of claiming rent for himself in the same way as he would be if he owned a water source and supplied water therefrom as a guaranteed supply to lands registered under that source as ayacut.	Arguments of Petitioner
In the present case, water, was Government water which was brought from Government project.	Arguments of Petitioner
10.	None
On behalf of the appellant it was submitted that this observation is unsound and is not supportable by any provision of law.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondents counsel was unable to support this observation of the High Court.	None
11.	None
Reverting to Ex. B24 Kalipatnam village was compared with Losaragutlapadu, an adjacent village.	None
In regard to that village also it is mentioned that there is an extensive wet cultivation in delta dry land under project channels as in Kalipatnam Shri J. Sambamurthy, to whose inspection note dated July 1, 1948 reference is made in Ex. B24 appeared as D. W. 5 and the counsel took us through his statement.	None
In crossexamination he deposed as follows I cannot say whether there are 4,000 acres of land which are double crop land.	None
There are some lands in which double crops are grown.	None
I cannot say their extent.	None
There are small extents of garden lands.	None
There are single crop lands under extension channel.	None
All these lands are treated as dry lands rents reduced.	None
The Kalipatnam is at the tail end of the delta The Losaragutlapadu is in Bhimavaram taluk Yanamadula Drain intervenes Kalipatnam and Losaragutlapadu.	None
Gollavanithippa lands have come under cultivation previously.	None
It is part of Losaragutlapadu.	None
I cannot say whether there are 11,000 acres of land uncultivated in Losaragutlapadu.	None
Probably it is forest area.	None
There were small extents of land in Muthyalapalli and Vempa under the Project Channel.	None
Ex. B 4 shows that there are lands of double crop.	None
Under the Act the plaintiff has to furnish a statement of lands etc.	None
The plaintiffs agent furnished Exhibit B6.	None
The soil of Losaragutlapadu was examined.	None
This is contained in Exhibit B24.The Settlement Officer classified the soils under contained Diglot Registers.	None
An extract of it is contained in Exhibit B24.	None
I cannot say readily now without reference to Settlement Manual what the figures given in the Diglot Register are relating to the soils.	None
That statement contained in the file relates to the Losaragutlapadu.	None
A similar statement for Kalipatnam was not taken.	None
There is no such statement for that village.	None
I did not write to the Settlement Department to prepare such a statement for suit village.	None
I do not know whether the Government analyse the soil through Agricultural Department before the project was started I examined the soils at one or two places and I consulted the Settlement Register at that time.	None
I cannot say whether those one or two places were under extension project.	None
I remember I have taken description of the soil from the Settlement Register and ManualI do not know about the construction of the project.	None
12.	None
Shri J. Satyanarayana, Tahsildar, who appeared as D. W. 7 stated in his crossexamination that the lands in Kalipatnam were sanctioned with two crops, though he could not say whether they were under cultivation since 1948.	None
He was also unable to say whether the Settlement Register from Kalipatnam was available in Taluk Office.	None
According to him water rate in the year 1958 was increased 50 per cent for all lands including Kalipatnam.	None
The cess was also increased proportionately.	None
He was unable to explain the figures given under the description of the soil in Ex. B24 and indeed he expressed his ignorance about the existence of any register for Kalipatnam on this subject.	None
13.	None
The appellants argument strongly pressed before us was that the class of land had been determined to be delta dry land exclusively on the basis of the settlement register which did not contain any entry with respect to Kalipatnam.	Arguments of Petitioner
The entry in the settlement register with respect to the soil of Losaragutlapadu could not be taken to cover the soil in Kalipatnam in the absence of evidence that the soil in these two villages was similar in this respect.	Arguments of Petitioner
Stress was also led on the submission that description in the settlement register could not be considered to be conclusive and that proper factual inquiry was necessary because the determination affects the appellants proprietary rights.	Arguments of Petitioner
The submission appears to us to possess merit.	Reasoning
The Special Officer had an obligation under Sec.	Reasoning
2 of the Reduction of Rent Act to determine in respect of Kalipatnam village the average rate of cash rent per acre for each class of ryoti land in existence at the time of the commencement of the Act such as, wet, dry and garden.	Reasoning
This had to be determined on the basis of relevant material.	Reasoning
The Special Officer, however, proceeded to found his determination only on the report of he Special Assistant (Ex. E24) which, as discussed above, only took into account the entry in the settlement register with respect to the soil of Losaragutlapadu.	Reasoning
This really means that the determination of the Special Officer is solely based on the settlement register containing no entry in regard to Kalipatnam.	Reasoning
This material is irrelevant and cannot constitute a rational basis for founding thereon the determination of the Special Officer.	Reasoning
His determination must, therefore, be held to be based on no evidence, with the result that it must be held to be in violation of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure.	Reasoning
A fortiori the order of the Government made under Sec. 3 (2) exclusively on the basis of the recommendation of the Special Officer must in consequence be held to be not in conformity with the provisions of the Reduction of Rent Act, and, therefore outside the purview of Sec. 3 (2) of that Act.	Reasoning
Section 8 (i) would accordingly be inapplicable and the jurisdiction of Civil Courts cannot be excluded.	Reasoning
The notification Ex.	Reasoning
A13 must, therefore, be struck down as contrary to law and ultra vires the Reduction of Rent Act.	None
14.	None
We accordingly allow the appeals with costs and strike down the report of the Special Officer as also the notification Ex.	Decision
A13.	Decision
As observed earlier challenge to Exhibit A1 was not pressed at the hearing by the appellant.	Decision
It would be open to the authorities concerned to proceed to reduce the rent in accordance with law.	Decision
