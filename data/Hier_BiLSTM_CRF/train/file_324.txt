The dispute in the present appeal pertains to the medical claim for the year 201415, with regard to son of the appellant, namely Master Jasnoor Singh.	Facts
The individual Mediclaim Policies of the said Master Jasnoor Singh from 20072008 to 20132014 was for different sum insured, varying from Rs.50,000 in 20072008 to Rs.2,54,000/ in 20132014.	Facts
In the year 20142015, the appellant took Family Mediclaim Policy for a sum insured of Rs.5,00,000/ for the period 07.02.2014 to 06.02.2015, which was for the appellant himself and his family members, namely, his wife, son Master Jasnoor Singh and daughter.	Facts

It was during the validity of the Family Mediclaim Policy 201415, that in the year 2014 Master Jasnoor Singh fell sick and had to undergo treatment in Post Graduate Institute (PGI), Chandigarh.	Facts
He was initially hospitalized from 24.05.2014 to 19.07.2014 for which the medical bill was for an amount of Rs.5,40,741/. He was again hospitalized from 31.08.2014 to 17.10.2014, for which the medical bill was for Rs.3,14,485/.	Facts
The total amount of medical bill thus came to Rs.8,55,226/. The appellant lodged a claim for the said amount with the respondentNational Insurance Company Ltd (for short ?Insurance Company?), which was initially repudiated by the Insurance Company without assigning any reason.	Facts
However, later considering that the said Master Jasnoor Singh had an individual medical claim policy in the year 20092010 for Rs.55,000/, the respondent  Insurance Company deposited a sum of Rs.27,550/ in the account of the appellant towards final payment of the claim.	Facts

Since the remaining claim was not paid, the appellant filed a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (for short ?	Facts
District Forum?)	Facts
claiming an amount of Rs.5,00,000/, which was the sum insured under the Family Mediclaim Policy for the relevant year 20142015.	Facts
Before the District Forum, the respondent Insurance Company raised various preliminary objections but had mainly claimed that since the said Master Jasnoor Singh was having preexisting disease, hence the claim was not payable under the terms of the Policy.	Facts
The District Forum, however, held that since the sum insured under the individual Mediclaim Policy of Master Jasnoor Singh for the year 20102011 (four years prior to his hospitalisation) was Rs.1,07,500/, the amount payable would be 50 of such sum insured for the year 20102011, which comes to Rs.53,750/ and not 50 of the sum insured in the year 20092010, according to which Insurance Company had paid Rs.27,550/. Thus, District Forum directed that the balance amount of Rs.26,200/ would be payable to the appellant, along with Rs.5000/ towards harassment and mental agony, plus Rs.2000/ on account of litigation expenses, along with interest 9 p.a. 5.

7.	None
The submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that since the individual Mediclaim Policy of Master Jasnoor Singh was continuously held since 20072008 till the year 20142015 and it not being the case of the Insurance Company that at the time of taking initial individual Mediclaim Policy in the year 2007, the said Master Jasnoor Singh had any such disease, hence, the repudiation or scaling down of the claim of the appellant could not be justified.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that the entire amount, as awarded by the State Commission, should be restored and this appeal be allowed.	Arguments of Petitioner
8.	None
Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent Insurance Company has justified the order of the National Commission in awarding the compensation of 50 of the sum insured for the year 20102011, as had been awarded by the District Forum and has prayed that the present appeal be dismissed.	Arguments of Respondent
9.	None
We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have perused the record.	None
10.	None
The fact that Mediclaim Policy of Master Jasnoor Singh was continuously taken by the appellant for varying sum insured since 20072008 till 20142015 is admitted by the insurance company.	Reasoning
It is also not disputed that at the time of taking the initial Mediclaim Policy for the year 20072008, the said Master Jasnoor Singh did not have any preexisting disease.	Reasoning
In fact, it is admitted that prior to the year 20142015, the appellant had been taking individual Mediclaim Policies for his family members and it was only in the year 20142015, at the time of renewal of the individual Mediclaim Policies, that the appellant had taken the Family Mediclaim Policy, which was effective from 07.02.2014 to 06.02.2015.	Reasoning
It is also admitted that the said Family Mediclaim Policy was for a total sum insured amount of Rs.5,00,000/. Under the terms of the Policy, the total expenses incurred for any one illness would be limited to 50 of the sum insured for the family.	Reasoning
The relevant Clause under the Policy is reproduced hereunder ?	None
Company?s liability would, arise if the treatment of disease or injury contracted suffered is incepted during the policy period.	None
Total expenses incurred for any one illness is limited to 50 of Sum Insured per family.	Reasoning
Company?s liability in respect of all claims admitted during the period of insurance shall not exceed the Sum Insured mentioned in the Schedule?.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
It is not disputed that the sum insured under the Family Mediclaim Policy, was Rs.5,00,000/. From the above, it would be clear that the total medical claim for all the four members of the family during the period of commencement of the Insurance Policy (i.e. 07.02.2014 to 06.02.2015) would be Rs.5,00,000/ and for any individual claim or illness for any one member of the family, the limit would be 50 of the sum insured, which in the present case would come to Rs.2,50,000/.	Reasoning
Thus, at best the maximum claim which could be payable in the present case would be 50 of the sum insured under the Family Mediclaim Policy for the medical treatment of one member of the family, which was Master Jasnoor Singh.	Reasoning
12.	None
It may be noticed that the claim could not have been repudiated by the Insurance Company as there was no preexisting disease when the initial individual Mediclaim Policy of Master Jasnoor Singh was taken in the year 20072008.	Reasoning
Since then the policy was regularly renewed up to the year 20142015.	Reasoning
Thus in the facts of the present case, the respondent Insurance Company cannot take the plea of any preexisting disease of Master Jasnoor Singh.	Reasoning
Even otherwise, after having initially repudiated the claim of the appellant, the Insurance Company had itself allowed the claim to the extent of Rs.27,550/, which amount was deposited in the account of the appellant, meaning thereby that the question of preexisting disease in the case of the claimant was not considered to be material by the Insurance Company.	Reasoning
13.	None
As we have already observed herein above, the total medical expense or claim for any one illness for any individual member of the family would be limited to 50 of the sum insured for the family.	Reasoning
In the present case, the sum insured for the family under the Family Mediclaim Policy was Rs.5,00,000/. Thus, in our considered view, the amount payable against the medical claim of Master Jasnoor Singh, under the policy, would be limited to the extent of Rs.2,50,000/. Undisputedly, the medical expense incurred and claimed by the appellant for the treatment of Master Jasnoor Singh within the effective period of the policy was over Rs.8,00,000/. As such the appellant would be entitled to a sum of Rs.2,50,000/ minus the amount already paid by the Insurance Company under the orders of the District Forum.	Reasoning
14.	None
Accordingly, we allow this appeal to the extent that the respondent Insurance Company shall pay to the appellant a sum of Rs.2,50,000/ (two lakh fifty thousand) minus the amount already paid, towards final settlement of the medical insurance claim of the appellant.	Decision
The appellant would also be entitled to an amount of Rs.50,000/ towards mental agony and harassment, plus Rs.30,000/ towards costs of litigation.	Decision
The Insurance Company would also be liable to pay interest 7.5 p.a.	Decision
on the balance amount payable, from the date of the complaint filed before the District Forum, till the date of actual payment of the balance amount.	Decision
