Being aggrieved, the appellants have filed these appeals.	Facts
Mr. D.N. Parikh, learned counsel for the appellants has submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the FIR lodged by respondent No.2Mahendrakumar is false and frivolous as the same subject matter is pending consideration in Summary Suit No.105/2015.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that at least two cases viz.	Arguments of Petitioner
Special Summary Suit No.105/2015 and criminal case in C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act are pending before the competent court and while so, the criminal case could not have been registered on the four receipts which are the subject matter of the pending litigations between the parties.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further submitted that in the Summary Suit No.105/2015, issue No.5 framed by the Court is whether the defendant proved that the plaintiff has fabricated the forged signature illegally and created forged receipts and the FSL reportreport of the handwriting expert is filed in the said suit and the Civil Court is yet to determine the issue as to the genuineness of the receipts.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel submitted that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the opinion of the handwriting expert is relevant evidence, but it is not a conclusive evidence and Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act empowers the Court to compare the admitted and disputed writings for the purpose of forming Courts opinion.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was contended that when the genuineness of four receipts is an issue in the civil suit and the dispute is of civil nature, the continuation of the criminal case is an abuse of process of the Court and the FIR No.I 194/2016 is liable to be quashed.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was also contended that the High Court erred in quashing the cheque case filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act and the High Court did not keep in view that issuance of cheques by Yogeshbhai from his NRE Account has been admitted.	Arguments of Petitioner
Refuting the above contentions, Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned Senior counsel for the respondents has submitted that appellant No.3Hashmukhbhai is the maternal uncle of Yogeshbhai and relying upon the words of appellant No.3 and his sonappellant No.2Vipulkumar, Yogeshbhai issued two cheques bearing Nos.8108 and 8109 for Rs.30,00,000/ each from his NRO Account and after issuing the cheques, Yogeshbhai realised that there was no funds in the said account and he asked appellant No.3 to return the above cheques and collect new cheques of another account.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that thereafter Yogeshbhai issued new cheques of NRE Account bearing Nos.20801 and 20802 of Rs.30,00,000/ each and at that time, appellant No.3 had told that he had not brought the old cheques with him and will return the old cheques in a day or two but never returned the cheques.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Senior counsel submitted that Yogeshbhai got suspicious and on making enquiry, he found that appellants No.2 and 3 were not intending to purchase any lands and thus, he has instructed the Bank to stop payment for all the four cheques.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Senior counsel further submitted that appellants made four forged receipts of Rs.30,00,000/ each by forging the signatures of respondent No.2Mahendrakumar and the handwriting expert opined that four receipts relied upon by appellant No.3Hasmukhbhai have not been signed by respondent No.2 Mahendrakumar and on the basis of FSL report, FIR No.I194/2016 has been registered under Sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 114 IPC.	Arguments of Respondent
It was submitted that since there is a prima facie case of forgery and cheating made out against the appellants, the High Court rightly declined to quash the FIR and the impugned order warrants no interference.	Arguments of Respondent
We have carefully considered the submissions and perused the impugned order and other materials on record.	None
The issue relates to the alleged forgery of four receipts dated 21.08.2010, 22.08.2010, 26.08.2010 and 28.08.2010 each for a sum of Rs.30,00,000/ totalling to Rs.1,20,00,000/ issued by respondent No.2Mahendrakumar.	Reasoning
For the recovery of the amount of Rs.1,20,00,000/, appellant No.3Hasmukhbhai filed Special Summary Suit No.105/2015 in October, 2015.	None
After receiving summons in Summary Suit No.105/2015, respondent No.2 Mahendrakumar entered appearance and filed application seeking leave to defend and the said application was allowed on 19.04.2016.	None
On application filed by appellant No.3Hasmukhbhai in the Summary Suit No.105/2015, four receipts were sent to Forensic Science Laboratory for obtaining the opinion of handwriting expert.	None
The handwriting experts report was received in the Court on 15.12.2016 to the effect that all the four receipts were not signed by respondent No.2Mahendrakumar.	None
It was thereafter on the complaint filed by respondent No.2, FIR No.I194/2016 dated 28.12.2016 was registered against the appellants for the offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 114 IPC.	Facts
In C.C.No.367/2016, case of appellant No.3Hasmukhbhai is that Yogeshbhai issued four cheques each for a sum of Rs.30,00,000/, details of which are as under table On presentation, the above cheques were dishonoured on the ground Payment stopped by the Drawer.	None
After issuing the legal notice, appellant No.3Hasmukhbhai filed criminal case in C.C.No.367/2016 on 08.12.2015 pertaining to two cheques bearing Nos.20801 and 20802.	None
It was only thereafter, respondent No.2 Mahendrakumar had filed the criminal complaint dated 20.03.2016 and also filed another criminal complaint dated 14.04.2016 against appellant No.1Rajeshbhai and appellant No.2Vipulkumar.	None
Since the police had not registered the FIR, respondent No.2 filed SCRA No.5945/2016 and SCRA No.6349/2016 before the High Court for seeking directions for lodging FIR.	None
The High Court vide orders dated 04.10.2016 and 06.09.2016 disposed of those petitions directing the police to investigate into the matter.	None
Be that as it may, in the Summary Suit No.105/2015, leave to defend was granted to respondent No.2Mahendrakumar on 19.04.2016.	None
On the application filed by appellant No.3 in the said Summary Suit No.105/2015, four receipts filed in the suit were sent to the handwriting expert.	None
The handwriting expert has opined that signatures in all the four receipts did not tally with the sample signatures which were of respondent No.2Mahendrakumar.	None
It was only thereafter, complaint was filed by Mahendrakumar, based on which, FIR No.I194/2016 was registered on 28.12.2016 against the appellants for the offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 114 IPC.	Facts
As rightly contended by the learned counsel for the appellants, in the Summary Suit No.105/2015, issue No.5 has been framed by the Court whether the defendant proved that the plaintiff has fabricated the forged signature illegally and created forged receipts .	Arguments of Petitioner
When the issue as to the genuineness of the receipts is pending consideration in the civil suit, in our view, the FIR ought not to have been allowed to continue as it would prejudice the interest of the parties and the stand taken by them in the civil suit.	Reasoning
It is also to be pointed out that in terms of Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act, the opinion of handwriting expert is a relevant piece of evidence but it is not a conclusive evidence.	Reasoning
It is always open to the plaintiffappellant No.3 to adduce appropriate evidence to disprove the opinion of the handwriting expert.	Reasoning
That apart, Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act empowers the Court to compare the admitted and disputed writings for the purpose of forming its own opinion.	Reasoning
Based on the sole opinion of the handwriting expert, the FIR ought not to have been registered.	Reasoning
Continuation of FIR No.I194/2016, in our view, would amount to abuse of the process of Court and the petition filed by the appellants under Section 482 Crl.P.C. in Criminal Misc.	Reasoning
Application No.2735/2017 to quash the FIR I194/2016 is to be allowed.	Reasoning
The High Court, in our view, erred in quashing the criminal case in C.C.No.367/2016 filed by appellant No.3Hasmukhbhai under Section 138 of N.I. Act.	Reasoning
As pointed out earlier, Yogeshbhai has admitted the issuance of cheques.	Reasoning
When once the issuance of cheque is admitted established, the presumption would arise under Section 139 of the N.I. Act in favour of the holder of cheque that is the complainantappellant No.3.	Reasoning
The nature of presumptions under Section139 of the N.I. Act and Section 118(a) of the Indian Evidence Act are rebuttable.	Reasoning
Yogeshbhai has of course, raised the defence that there is no illegally enforceable debt and he issued the cheques to help appellant No.3Hasmukhbhai for purchase of lands.	Reasoning
The burden lies upon the accused to rebut the presumption by adducing evidence.	Reasoning
The High Court did not keep in view that until the accused discharges his burden, the presumption under Section 139 of N.I. Act will continue to remain.	Reasoning
It is for Yogeshbhai to adduce evidence to rebut the statutory presumption.	Reasoning
When disputed questions of facts are involved which need to be adjudicated after the parties adduce evidence, the complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act ought not to have been quashed by the High Court by taking recourse to Section 482 Cr.P.C.	Reasoning
Though, the Court has the power to quash the criminal complaint filed under Section 138 of the N.I. Act on the legal issues like limitation, etc.	Reasoning
Criminal complaint filed under Section 138 of the N.I. Act against Yogeshbhai ought not have been quashed merely on the ground that there are inter se dispute between appellant No.3 and respondent No.2.	Reasoning
Without keeping in view the statutory presumption raised under Section 139 of the N.I. Act, the High Court, in our view, committed a serious error in quashing the criminal complaint in C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act.	Reasoning
In the result, the impugned order is set aside and these appeals are allowed.	Decision
Criminal Misc.	Decision
Application No.2735/2017 filed by the appellants is allowed and the FIR No.I194/2016 is quashed.	Decision
Criminal Misc.	Decision
Application No.24588/2017 filed by Yogeshbhai Muljibhai Patel stands dismissed.	Decision
Case filed by appellant No.3 Hasmukhbhai Ravjibhai Patel under Section 138 of N.I. Act  C.C.No.367/2016 stands restored.	Decision
The 5 th Additional Civil Judge JMFC, Bharuch is directed to proceed with the case in C.C.No.367/2016 filed under Section 138 of N.I. Act and afford sufficient opportunity to both the parties and dispose the same in accordance with law.	Decision
The Summary Suit No.105/2015 shall be proceeded in accordance with law without being influenced by any of the views expressed by the High Court in the impugned order.	Decision
