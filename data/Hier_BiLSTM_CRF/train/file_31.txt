The purchase orders are from the month of June 2018, by which date the respondent had no connection with the Company.	Arguments of Respondent
While evaluating the merits of the rival submissions in the context of the correctness of the order passed by the High Court granting bail, it would be necessary, at the outset, to note the reasons which weighed with the High Court in doing so.	Reasoning
The High Court having recorded the submissions of the respondent and of the learned counsel for the NCB has indicated the following reasons for grant of bail Having considered the submissions and having perused the material on record, without commenting on the merits of the matter, prima facie, it appears that the applicant may not be guilty of any offence and considering his clean past and being an educated person as submitted that, he has a degree in Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) may not commit any offence in future, I am of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail.	Reasoning
Ex facie, there has been no application of mind by the High Court to the rival submissions and, particularly, to the seriousness of the allegations involving an offence punishable under the provisions of the NDPS Act.	Reasoning
Merely recording the submissions of the parties does not amount to an indication of a judicial or, for that matter, a judicious application of mind by the Single Judge of the High Court to the basic question as to whether bail should be granted.	Reasoning
The provisions of Section 37 of the NDPS Act provide the legal norms which have to be applied in determining whether a case for grant of bail has been made out.	Reasoning
There has been a serious infraction by the High Court of its duty to apply the law.	Reasoning
The order granting bail is innocent of an awareness of the legal principles involved in determining whether bail should be granted to a person accused of an offence under the NDPS Act.	Reasoning
The contention of the respondent that he had resigned from the Company, Altruist Chemicals Private Limited, must be assessed with reference to the allegations in the criminal complaint which has been filed in the Court of the District and Sessions Judge.	Reasoning
Gautam Budh Nagar (Annexure P6).	Reasoning
The relevant part of the complaint reads as follows That during investigation of the case, letter dated 27.11.2018 was sent to the Registrar of Companies for providing details of the Directors etc of the company in question i.e. U s Altruist Chemicals Pvt Ltd and vide its report dated 03.12.2018 Registrar of Companies provided the said information and from the perusal of said information documents, it reveals that accused Prateek Shukla and Bismillah Khan are the Directors.	Reasoning
Accused Himanshu Rana was also Director but he has resigned from the directorship.	Reasoning
From the perusal of the documents, it also reveals that they had registered the company, i.e., Altruist Chemical Pvt.	Reasoning
Ltd.	Reasoning
At 001, Block AbSector45, Noida, which is a residential area and accused persons also obtained Unique Registration No. from the NCB on the above said premises.	Reasoning
We may also note at this stage the contention of the respondent in the application for bail which was filed before the High Court (Annexure P8) that he had transferred 99 of his shareholding in the Company to Bismilla Khan Ahmadzai.	Reasoning
Bismilla Khan Ahmadzai, as the prosecution alleges at this stage, is an Afghan national.	Reasoning
The application for bail which had been filed before the High Court as well as the counter affidavit which has been filed in the present proceedings suppress more than what they disclose.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, we are of the view that the High Court was clearly not justified in granting bail and the reasons provided by the High Court, as we have already indicated above, do not reflect application of mind to the seriousness of the offence which is involved.	Reasoning
Indicating that the respondent as an educated person with a Bachelor of Technology may not commit any offence is an extraneous circumstance which ought not to have weighed with the High Court in the grant of bail for an offence under the NDPS Act.	Reasoning
For the above reasons, we are of the view that the High Court has misapplied the law to the facts in arriving at a decision for the grant of bail to the respondent.	Decision
We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 7 May 2019.	Decision
As a consequence, the bail which has been granted by the High Court to the respondent shall stand cancelled.	Decision
The respondent shall surrender forthwith as a result of the cancellation of bail by the present order of this Court.	Decision
Pending application, if any, stands disposed of.	Decision
