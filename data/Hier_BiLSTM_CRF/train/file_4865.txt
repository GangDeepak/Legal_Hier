The Division Bench of the High Court made following observationsThe educational qualification for the post in question is that the candidate must be graduate with the subject of Psychology along with other essential qualifications of being L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	None
The condition of being B.Ed or being possessed L.T. B.T. certificates or B.Ed. degree is an essential qualification along with the condition of being graduate with the subject Psychology.	Reasoning
If a candidate is not possessed of any of the aforesaid essential qualifications, he she shall not be eligible for participating in selection nor can be appointed.	None
Under the relevant rules i.e. Janjatiya Vikas Sikchan Aur Kermchariverg Sewa Niyamawali, 1991 of which a reference has been made by the learned Single Judge also shows that qualifications requires a graduate with the subject of Psychology, with L.T. B.T. B.Ed., as the case may be Be that as it may, in the advertisement in pursuance of which the appellant had applied the prescribed qualification was graduation with subject Psychology along with L.T. B.T. B.Ed. degree.	None
That being so the appellant fully knew at the time of application that he mus possess the said essential qualifications as pronounced in the advertisement.	None
In case he was aggrieved by description of such qualifications, he could have been better advised to challenge the said advertisement event before applying but once he has applied in terms of the aforesaid advertisement without any protest he cannot take a turn and say that these conditions were illegally placed in the same.11.	None
The appellant has brought on record both the advertisement as well as 1991 rules.	None
The advertisement has been filed as Annexure A1 along with I.A.No.2 of 2013.	None
The advertisement was issued in Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran and photocopy of first page of the newspaper is also annexed at page 24 of Annexure A1.	None
The translated copy in English has also been attached at page 6.	None
We are concerned with the post of Psychologist in the present case.	None
Hence, it is useful to refer to the qualification prescribed for the aforesaid post.12.	None
The original advertisement being in vernacular Hindi, it is relevant to note the said content of vernacular advertisement which was to the following effectTABLE13.	None
The English translation of the advertisement at Page 6 of 10 Annexure A1 with regard to the post of Psychologist is as followsTABLE14.	None
The careful reading of original advertisement which is in vernacular language indicate that what was prescribed was, In Psychology subject graduate L.T. B.T. B.Ed Use of Stroke between graduate and L.T. B.T. B.Ed. indicates that all were alternate qualification.	None
The advertisement cannot be read to mean providing for graduate in Psychology with L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	Reasoning
as has been read by the High Court and contended by the respondent.15.	Reasoning
The words graduate L.T. B.T. B.Ed. are all alternative qualification which are prefixed with word In subject of Psychology.	Reasoning
A harmonious reading may mean that a person graduate in subject of Psychology or L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	None
with Psychology is eligible.	Reasoning
When the post is of Psychologist, both graduation with Psychology and training certification i.e. L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	Reasoning
have also to be with Psychology.	Reasoning
The respondents have wrongly interpreted the advertisement to mean that the person should possess both graduate with Psychology as well as L.T. B.T. B.Ed. which on the face of it does not appear to be correct.16.	Reasoning
Present is a case where appellant was called to appear in written examination and interview and his name was included in the merit list.	Facts
It was only at the time of verification of the certificate he was denied the appointment on the ground that he does not fulfill the qualification as advertised, whereas he fulfilled the advertised qualification.17.	Facts
There is one more reason to accept the meaning of advertisement as noticed above.	Reasoning
In advertisement, with regard to various qualifications, words ??	Reasoning
(or) ???quot (with), ????	None
(either) and stroke ( ) have been used.	Reasoning
The appointing authority is well aware of the meaning of stroke ( ), word or, either and with which has been frequently used in the qualifications which is apparent from the advertisement i.e. Annexure A1.	Reasoning
The Appointing Authority used word with(???)	Reasoning
, when it wanted both the qualifications together.	Reasoning
Wherever stroke ( ) has been used it was used when either of the qualifications were indicated.	Reasoning
The advertisement Annexure A1 contains qualifications for various posts and in several qualifications stroke ( ) has been used.	Reasoning
A look into those qualifications clearly indicate that stroke ( ) was used in the other qualifications denoting one or either qualification.	None
It is useful to extract some qualifications where stroke ( ) was used apart from qualification prescribed for the post of Psychologist.	None
The use of stroke ( ) in the qualifications at Item No. 5	None
Grah Mother, Item No. 6 Karamshalal Prashikshak Foundary Shop Black Smith Shop, Item No.11	None
Sewing Trainer, Item No. 16 Music Teacher and Item No. 17 Stitching Trainer are extracted as belowTableA perusal of the above qualifications clearly indicated that stroke ( ) was used regarding qualifications, in alternative, i.e., one or either.	None
In above view of the matter, we are of the view that the use of stroke ( ) between Graduate L.T. B.T. B.Ed. were in the same line meaning thereby one or either.	Reasoning
It is relevant to notice that before the aforesaid qualifications, the words in Psychology subject has been used as prefix, which clearly means that all the alternative qualifications were required to have with Psychology subject i.e. Graduation with Psychology L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	Reasoning
in the subject of Psychology.	Reasoning
Hence, all the three i.e. Graduation, L.T., B.T. B.Ed. has to be in Psychology subject.	Reasoning
Those persons who have done L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	Reasoning
with Psychology subject are eligible like person graduated with Psychology, which is the plain and simple meaning of the advertisement which has been missed by the State as well as the High Court.18.	Reasoning
The Division Bench in support of its view has interpreted the advertisement in the following manner Even otherwise, if the interpretation of the learned counsel for the appellant is taken as correct, it would mean that there will be a different set of candidates namely, one who possess B.Ed. degree with the subject Psychology and the others who are not B.A. with Psychology, but if they are B.Ed. or possess L.T. B.T. certificates, they would be entitled for appointment.	Reasoning
The above view of the Division Bench that accepting the interpretation of appellant would mean that there is different set of candidates namely one who possess B.Ed.	None
Degree with the subject Psychology and the others who are not B.A. with Psychology, but if they are B.Ed. or possess L.T. B.T. certificates, they would be entitled for appointment.	Reasoning
The above view does not support the interpretation, which we have put on the qualifications mentioned for the Psychologist i.e. Graduate L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	Reasoning
were prefixed with the in the subject of Psychology.	None
Thus, there is no question of there being different set of candidates.	None
All candidates, who have Psychology as their subject of Graduation L.T. B.T. B.Ed. were eligible for the post and they all form one class, i.e. those, who have studied Psychology.	Reasoning
Thus, the view of the High Court cannot be accepted.19.	Reasoning
In the counter affidavit filed in this court also the said qualifications are being read by the respondent as graduate in Psychology with L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	None
1991 Rules have been filed as Annexure P1 along with the rejoinder affidavit of the appellant.	None
It is relevant to note that in Schedule to the Rules, the post of Psychologist has been referred to at page 166 it is relevant to quote the qualification mentioned in the Schedule to the 1991 Rules, which is to the following effectTABLE20.	None
The above rules clearly indicate that qualification for Psychologist is M.A. in Psychology.	Reasoning
There is no other column in which Psychologist can be read in the entire rule.	Reasoning
The B.Ed.	Reasoning
is a preferential qualification and essential qualification is only M.A. in Psychology according to 1991 Rules.	Reasoning
It is relevant to note that although learned Single Judge has referred to 1991 Rules but he observed that 1991 rules lays down the qualification as trained graduate along with L.T. B.T. B.Ed., the above observations of learned Single Judge are not sustainable in view of the qualification as prescribed in 1991 Rules as extracted above.21.	Reasoning
In the counter affidavit filed in this court by the state, 1991 rules have been accepted to be the relevant rules regulating the recruitment as has been noted in the Paragraph Xiii extracted above.	Reasoning
The qualification prescribed in the Rules does not provide for L.T. B.T. B.Ed.	Reasoning
as essential qualification.	Reasoning
Thus nonpossession of L.T. B.T. B.Ed. does not make him disqualified for the post as per Statutory Rules of 1991.	None
Appellant is postgraduate in psychology and thus, also fulfill the qualification prescribed in the 1991 Rules.	Reasoning
The respondent in counter affidavit had themselves come with the case that the appointment has to be made in accordance with the statutory rules.	Reasoning
When under the statutory rules, 1991, appellant fulfill the qualification there is no occasion to deny appointment to him.22.	Reasoning
Any part of the advertisement which is contrary to the statutory rules has to give way to the statutory prescription.	Reasoning
Thus, looking to the qualification prescribed in the statutory rules, appellant fulfills the qualification and after being selected for the post denying appointment to him is arbitrary and illegal.	Reasoning
It is well settled that when there is variance in the advertisement and in the statutory rules, it is statutory rules which take precedence.	Reasoning
In this context, reference is made in judgment of this Court in the case of Malik Mazhar Sultan Anr.	None
Vs.	None
U.P. Public Service Commission Ors., 2006 (9) SCC 507.	None
Paragraph 21 of the judgment lays down above proposition which is to the following effect21.	None
The present controversy has arisen as the advertisement issued by PSC stated that the candidates who were within the age on 01.07.2001 and 01.07.2002 shall be treated within age for the examination.	None
Undoubtedly, the excluded candidates were of eligible age as per the advertisements but the recruitment to the service can only be made in accordance with the Rules and the error, if any, in the advertisement cannot override the Rules and create a right in favour of a candidate if otherwise not eligible according to the Rules.	None
The relaxation of age can be granted only of permissible under the Rules and not on the basis of the advertisement.	None
If the interpretation of the Rules by PSC when it issued the advertisement was erroneous, no right can accrue on basis thereof.	None
Therefore, the answer to the question would turn upon the interpretation of the Rules.23.	None
It has also come on the record that although the post of Psychologist was declared as dead cadre by the Government Order dated 09.05.2008, but the posts were subsequently revived by another Government Order dated 17.08.2010.	Reasoning
Reference of 2009 Rules, namely, Uttar Pradesh Social Welfare Department of Teacher Service Rule, 2009, has been made which may have no relevance with regard to issue in the present case since the appointment in the present case was made in pursuance of the 1991 Rules and advertisement was dated 30.08.2001.	Reasoning
The appellant after being selected for the post of Psychologist was illegally denied issuance of appointment letter on wrong interpretation of the advertisement and the rules, hence, the appellant has made out a case for issuing a direction to appoint him on the post of Psychologist.24.	Reasoning
We, thus, direct the respondents to issue an appointment order to the appellant in pursuance of his selection against the advertisement dated 30.08.2001 on the post of Psychologist within a period of two months from the date, copy of this Order is produced before the respondents.25.	Decision
The judgments of the High Court are set aside and the appeals are allowed accordingly.	Decision
