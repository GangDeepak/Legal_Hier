Facts
Heard learned advocates on both sides and perused the records.	None
Learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant, taking us through the material on record in detail and contends that the Courts below while concluding have concurrently erred in holding that the AppellantPlaintiff is not the owner of the property in question and that the Defendants have purchased the property from one Dharampal vide sale deed dated 15.8.1966.It is relevant to note that after a huge gap of about 28 years from the date of the suit, the Respondent filed an application before the trial Court Under Order 6 Rule 17 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure seeking to amend the pleadings.	Arguments of Petitioner
Through this application, the Respondent sought to change the number of the suit property from Municipal No. 1443 to 1443A and also the date of the sale deed from 15.8.1966 to 15.9.1966 to establish and prove his ownership over the suit property.	None
The allegations were made by the Appellant that the Respondent has forged the sale deed in his favour and that the forged sale deed relied upon by the Respondent cannot be made the proof of ownership.	None
In that regard, the trial Court ordered for an enquiry and has, however, concluded that the allegations so made by the Appellant regarding forgery of the documents are not proved.8.	None
Both the parties have led their evidence, both oral and documentary.	None
The crucial document is the sale deed dated 15.9.1966 (Ex. DW1/1) produced by the Respondent to show his ownership of the plot in question, i.e. plot No. 27 (Municipal No. 1443).	None
Since there was an allegation of forgery in respect of the said document, the enquiry was conducted, as mentioned supra, and the trial Court summoned the original records pertaining to the said sale deed.	None
The Office of the SubRegistrar, Asaf Ali Road, Delhi produced the original document, i.e. the sale deed 15.9.1966, maintained in the SubRegistrars office in a sealed cover.	None
The trial Court has marked the said document which was produced in the sealed cover as Ex. C1.	None
It is needless to mention that Ex.	None
C1 is the original document maintained in the SubRegistrars office to verify as to whether the sale deed Ex. DW1/1 produced by the Defendants is forged one or not.9.	None
Ex. DW1/1 dated 15.9.1966 relied upon by the Defendants to show their ownership is in Urdu.	Reasoning
English translation is also produced before us.	Reasoning
The English translation of Ex. DW1/1 is not disputed by the learned Counsel for the Respondent.	Reasoning
Ex. DW1/1 relied upon by the Respondent shows that Sardar Baldev Singh, s o Sardar Kartar Singh purchased one piece of land bearing No. 1443 measuring 230 square yards out of an area of 567 square yards from Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram.	Reasoning
This sale deed also reveals that the said Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram had in turn purchased the very property through a registered sale deed dated 5.12.1947 from Uday Chand, s o Choudhury Wazir Singh.	Reasoning
This sale deed, according to the Appellant, is a forged one.10.	Reasoning
The said document Ex.	Reasoning
C1 is almost replication of Ex. DW1/1 in all particulars, except on material particulars.	Reasoning
Ex.	Reasoning
C1 clearly reveals that Sardar Balwant Singh, s o Sardar Kartar Singh purchased one plot of land measuring 230 square yards out of 567 square yards from Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram.	Reasoning
It is curious to note that either Municipal No. 1443 or Municipal No. 1443A are not found in Ex. C1.	Reasoning
It is no doubt true that Ex.	Reasoning
C1 also relates to 230 square yards out of 567 square yards, purchased through a sale deed dated 15.9.1966 from one Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram.	Reasoning
The very document also reveals that Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram had in turn purchased the property from Uday Chand, s o Choudhary Wazir Singh.11.	Reasoning
The Appellant has also relied upon the document Ex.	Arguments of Petitioner
C3 dated 5.12.1947 which is in Urdu language.	Arguments of Petitioner
English translation is also furnished and such translation is not disputed before us.	Arguments of Petitioner
Through the said sale deed, Udai Chand, s o Chaudhary Wazir Singh sold the three plots of land, i.e. plot Nos. 30, 31 and 34 in favour of Lala Dharampal, S o Rai Sahab Choban Ram.	Reasoning
The sale deed Ex.	Reasoning
C3 further discloses that the three plots, namely plot Nos. 30, 31 and 34 which are adjoining each other and situated at Chameli Wala, known as Wazir Singh in the village Mubarakpur Kotla, Delhi are carved out of one piece of land measuring 567 square yards of different dimensions.	Reasoning
These plots were sold in favour of Lala Dharampal, S o Rai Sahab Choban Ram for a valuable consideration through the said sale deed by Shri Udai Chand.	Reasoning
The boundaries of the said plots individually on all the four sides are mentioned in detail.	Reasoning
They clearly reveal that the three plots are abutting each other.12.	Reasoning
Plot No. 30 is measuring	Reasoning
60 ft. X 30 ft. (200 square yards) Plot No. 31 is measuring	Reasoning
60 ft. X 30 ft. (200 square yards) and Plot No. 34 is measuring 58 ft.	Reasoning
x	Reasoning
26 ft. (167.56 square yards).	Reasoning
Thus, it is amply clear that all the said three sites collectively measure about 567 square yards.	Reasoning
Ex.	Reasoning
C3 clearly reveals that all the three plots were carved out of 567 square yards only.	Reasoning
Hence, Choudhary Udai Singh, who was the owner of 567 square yards had formed three sites, viz.	Reasoning
Plot Nos. 30, 31 and 34, out of entire 567 square yards and sold all the three plots in favour of Lala Dharampal.	Reasoning
Not even an inch of property was left after selling the three plots in total area of 567 square yards after selling to Lala Dharampal.13.	Reasoning
One more sale deed (marked as Ex. DW4/1) on record is dated 9.12.1947.	Reasoning
Through the said sale deed, Udai Chand, s o Chaudhary Wazir Singh sold plot No. 28 measuring 200 square yards in favour of Pandit Ved Prakash Shukla, s o Pandit Nand Lal Shukla for a valuable consideration.	Reasoning
The boundaries of the said plot No. 28 are also mentioned in the said sale deed, which clarify that plot No. 28 is adjoining plot No. 27.14.	Reasoning
The maps showing the plots are also on record.	Reasoning
A perusal of the maps Ex. PW2/4 and Ex. DW1/3 reveal that plot Nos. 30 and 31 are adjoining each other and they form one block.	Reasoning
East, South and North of these plots are roads.	Reasoning
Another map relating to plot No. 28, which was stated to be annexed with the sale deed dated 9.12.1947, reveals that plot No. 28 sold by Uday Chand, s o Wazir Singh in favour of Ved Prakash Shukla, s o Pandit Nand Lal Shukla is adjoining plot No. 27.	Reasoning
To the East of plot No. 28, it is a 16 feet road and to the East of that 16 feet road is plot No. 30.	Reasoning
To the West of plot No. 28 lies plot No. 27.	Reasoning
Thus, plot Nos. 27 and 28 are also surrounded on three directions by the roads.	Reasoning
The two maps clearly reveal that they match each other and plot Nos. 30, 31 and 34 are adjoining each other.	Reasoning
They also reveal that to the West of plot No. 30 is a 16 feet road.	Reasoning
The West of that 16 feet road is plot No. 28 measuring 200 square yards and West of plot No. 28 is plot No. 27.15.	Reasoning
According to the Respondents case, as mentioned supra, the land in question was purchased by him vide sale deed dated 15.8.1966 (which date is later amended after 22 years as 15.9.1966) from one Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram.	Arguments of Respondent
In turn, Mr. Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram had purchased the property from Udai Chand, s o Choudhary Wazir Singh vide sale deed No. 3292 dated 5.12.1947.16.	Arguments of Respondent
As aforementioned, Ex. DW1/1 discloses that Sardar Baldev Singh purchased plot No. 1443 measuring 230 square yards from Dharampal, s o Haveli Ram, whereas the original deed which was summoned to the Court by the trial Court, which is marked as Ex. CRW2/P1 (Ex. C1) clearly reveals that it was not the Baldev Singh who has purchased the suit property, but it was Sardar Balwant Singh, s o Sardar Kartar Singh.	Reasoning
So also, the plot number of the Municipal plot No. 1443 is also not mentioned in the original deed.	Reasoning
There is nothing on record to show that Sardar Balwant Singh is the same as Sardar Baldev Singh.	Reasoning
So also, there is nothing on record to show as to why and when the number of the plot, i.e. plot No. 1443, was inserted in the sale deed which is produced in support of the case of the Respondent as Ex. DW1/1.	Reasoning
Thus, fabrication of the said deed dated 15.9.1966 (i.e. Ex. DW1/1) is evident from comparison of the same with the original sale deed received by the trial Court in the sealed cover from SubRegistrars office.	Reasoning
It is relevant to note that Balwant Singh has nothing to do with the present case.17.	Reasoning
The sale deed Ex. DW1/1 dated 15.9.1966 is in respect of the land measuring 230 square yards out of 567 square yards, obviously had to be carved out of plot Nos. 30, 31 and 34 belonging to Shri Dharampal.	Reasoning
The same is clear from the sale deed 5.12.1947, under which the original owner Udai Chand had sold the three plots in favour of Lala Dharampal, who in turn sold the same in favour of Baldev Singh.	Reasoning
Thus, the sale deed Ex. DW1/1 cannot be in respect of the Appellants plot No. 27.18.	Reasoning
The site plan of the locality of Kotla Mubarakpur, which was marked as Ex. PW2/4 clearly shows that the location of property bearing plot Nos. 21, 22, 27, 28, 30 and 31 which are adjacent to each other and in a straight row, of course, a small road of 16 feet exists in between plot Nos. 28 and 30.19.	Reasoning
The site map of plot No. 28 dated 9.12.1947, which is a certified copy obtained from the SubRegistrar office, if compared with the site map of plots bearing Nos. 30, 31 and 34 dated 5.12.1947, which is also a certified copy obtained from the SubRegistrar office, match with each other.	Reasoning
These maps were stated to have been produced along with the sale deeds in respect of those plots at the time of their registration.	Reasoning
The location of plots as shown in the maps is exactly the same, as mentioned in the sale deed pertaining to those plots.	Reasoning
Those sale deeds were executed at an undisputed point of time.	Reasoning
These site maps help in unmasking the fraud committed.20.	Reasoning
We have already discussed in detail about the location of each of the plots, including plot No. 27, which is adjacent to plot No. 28 owned by one Ved Prakash Shukla.	Reasoning
As mentioned earlier, plot No. 27 lies to the west of plot No. 28.	Reasoning
Even, according to the Respondent, his plot is adjacent to plot No. 28 of Ved Prakash Shukla and he relies upon Ex. DW1/1 to support his contention.	Reasoning
Thus, the Respondents claim to have allegedly purchased the property from one Dharampal, who owned plot Nos. 30, 31 and 34 which lie on the east of plot No. 28 and 16 feet road.	Reasoning
Under no circumstance, plot No. 27 can ever be carved out from plot Nos. 30, 31 and 34, as sought to be shown by the Respondent, inasmuch as such claim leaves the existence of plot No. 28 totally inexplicable as per the claims and the site map submitted by the Respondent.21.	Reasoning
In so far as the Plaintiffs Appellants case is concerned, we do not find any reason to suspect the sale deed pertaining to plot No. 27 purchased by the Appellants father, namely, Mehar Chand, s o Maghar Mal.	Reasoning
The AppellantPlaintiff relies upon the sale deed dated 30.5.1952.	Reasoning
The copy of the said sale deed produced before the court was in Urdu language, the translation of which in English language is also produced for the convenience of the court.	Reasoning
It is relevant to note that the Respondents counsel has not objected to such English translation of the said sale deed in favour of the Appellants father produced before the Court.	Reasoning
The said sale deed reveals that Smt.	Reasoning
Kesara Devi, d o Lala Chint Ram, w o Lala Sham Lala purchased the residential land measuring 200 square yards (60 ft. x 30 ft.)	Reasoning
bearing No. 27 situated at Wazir Nagar, village Mubarak Kotla, Delhi from Smt.	Reasoning
Kailashwati on 23.1.1948, which was confirmed registered on 10.3.1948 before the SubRegistrar, Delhi.	Reasoning
The said Kesara Devi, d o Lala Chint Ram in turn sold the said property in favour of Shri Mehar Chand, s o Lala Maghar Mal, who is none other than the father of the AppellantPlaintiff for a valuable consideration.	Reasoning
In the very sale deed, the boundaries are mentioned.	Reasoning
It is specified in the said sale deed that plot No. 28 abuts plot No. 27 in the East (i.e. plot No. 27 is to the west of plot No. 28).	Reasoning
So also, all other sides of the said property are surrounded by road.	Reasoning
The boundaries mentioned in the said sale deed executed by Smt.	Reasoning
Kesara Devi in favour of the Appellants father fully concur with the boundaries of plot No. 28, as is clear from the sale deed pertaining to the said plot No. 28 as well as from the maps.	Reasoning
After the demise of Appellants father, the Appellant has inherited the said plot and thus has become the owner of the said plot No. 27.	Reasoning
It is not the case of the Respondent that he had purchased plot No. 27 from Smt.	Reasoning
Kesara Devi who is the real owner of the property.22.	Reasoning
It is the specific case of the Respondent that he had purchased plot No. 27 carved out of 567 square yards of land belonging to one Dharampal.	Reasoning
Since such Dharampal was never the owner of plot No. 27, there was no occasion of transferring the title relating to plot No. 27 in favour of the Respondent.	Reasoning
Hence, it is amply proved by the Appellant that he is the owner of plot No. 27 and that he is entitled to get back the possession of the same from the Respondent, who is in unauthorised possession.23.	Reasoning
Having regard to the aforementioned discussion, we are of the clear view that the Appellant has proved his case and the suit is to be decreed.	Reasoning
The trial Court and the first appellate Court unfortunately have erred to take into consideration the aforementioned factual aspects while coming to the conclusion.	Reasoning
The High Court has also, without assigning any valid reason, confirmed the judgments of the trial Court and the first appellate Court, which led to injustice.24.	Reasoning
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.	Decision
The impugned judgments of the High Court, first appellate Court and the trial Court are set aside and the civil suit No. 354/03/75 filed by the original Plaintiff Late Mehar Chand Kohli before the trial Court is decreed.	Decision
