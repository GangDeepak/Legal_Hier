Lakshmanan, J. The employees of Hotel Agra Ashok filed a writ petition being No. 41650 of 2001 in the Allahabad High Court questioning the action of the first respondent  India Tourism Development Corporation (hereinafter called the ITDC), New Delhi to sell Hotel Agra Ashok out rightly to a private party as arbitrary and illegal.

It is further submitted that the entire Hotel Agra Ashok is being sold out only merely for a sum of Rs.3.90 crores whereas the valuation by the Agra Cantonment Board in the year 1999 of its land and buildings alone is more than Rs.5.58 crores.	Facts
According to the employees, its market price at present cannot be less than Rs.20 crores.	Facts
It is the contention of the employees that because of the change of ownership of the Hotel, the service conditions of the employees should not be changed by the private person and that the existing service conditions as originally agreed between the various employees of the Hotel and the new purchaser must be maintained.

However, their service rights are to be protected since there is no difference in service conditions between the employees of Hotel Manali Ashok and Hotel Agra Ashok, both are similar and equal and the discrimination between the two sets of employees is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and, therefore, both are to be treated similarly.

T.C. No. 76 of 2002 (Arising out of T.P.(C) No. 948 of 2001)5.	Facts
Civil Writ Petition No. 7195 of 2001 was filed by one K.K.Gautham and Ors.	Facts

It is further submitted that the contention of employees that the scheme of VRS in respect of the employees of Ashok Travels Tours (a Unit of ITDC) be made applicable to the employees of the disinvested Unit  Hotel Agra Ashok is absolutely untenable because after the disinvestment, it is for the buyer to float the scheme of VRS in terms of the transferred documents.9.	Facts
In view of the above, it is submitted that the apprehension of the petitioners is baseless and liable to be rejected.10.	Facts
The Union of India filed its affidavit in reply through its Under Secretary and submitted that successive governments, both at the Centre and the States have been following the economic policy of disinvestment in Public Sector Enterprises due to various reasons and in August, 1996, the Central Government set up a Public Sector Disinvestment Commission to make recommendations on the identified Central Public Sector Undertakings which may be disinvested.

Facts
The Disinvestment Commission in its report recommended that ITDC falls in the noncore category and hence disinvestment can go up to 74 or more.	Facts
The recommendation was accepted by the Government at the level of Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment and a decision was taken by InterMinisterial Group and at the level of the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment to divest each property individually rather than altogether or in groups.12.	Facts
Respondent Nos. 4 5 filed a separate counter affidavit in reply.	Facts
According to them, the Government of India had taken a decision for disinvestment of the properties owned by respondent No.1 as majority of properties doing hotel business were running huge losses to the tune of crores of rupees and unnecessarily increasing the liabilities of the Corporation.	Facts
It was submitted that there is no change in service conditions of the employees as per the terms of share purchase agreement.	Facts
That after the creation of the new Company  Hotel Yamuna View Private Limited, all the employees working with Hotel Agra Ashok were shifted to the new company which was also a subsidiary company of respondent No.1.	Facts

Facts
Accordingly, the service conditions of the employees working with Hotel Agra Ashok were maintained as before.	Facts
Some of the other employees of Hotel Agra Ashok filed civil Writ Petition No. 7195 of 2001 before the High Court of Delhi and that the Government of India as per the report of the Disinvestment Commission accepted the same and transferred the hotel to the respondents and that the decision of the Government of India to sell its share in ITDC was a policy decision within the ambit of law on the Constitution of India.	Facts
With regard to the VRS scheme, it was submitted that for the employees of Ashok Travels and Tours, VRS Scheme was introduced by circular dated 02.03.2001 but there was no policy for VRS regarding Hotel Agra Ashok.	Facts
Also under clause 8 of the said circular regarding introduction of VRS, it is clearly stated that the schemes does not confer any right whatsoever on any employee to have his request for voluntary retirement accepted.13.	Facts

No. 76 of 2002 for the respective petitioners and Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel, Mr. Ashok Bhan and Mr. Gaurav Agarwal and Mr. Praveen Jain, learned counsel for the respective respondents.	Facts
We have carefully perused the averments made in the affidavit and the reply filed by the respective respondents and the rejoinder by the petitioners.	None
Our attention was also drawn to the scheme of arrangement (demerger) between ITDC Ltd. and Hotel Yamuna View Private Limited, report of the Disinvestment Commission and other relevant records and annexures filed in both the writ petitions.	None
Mr. M.L. Bhat, learned senior counsel reiterated the submissions in the Court and Mr. Jayant Nath, learned senior counsel reiterated the contentions raised in the writ petition at the time of hearing.	None
After inviting our attention to the prayer in the respective writ petition, they also invited our attention to the order passed on 13.12.2001 by the High Court directing maintenance of status quo regarding service conditions of Class III and IV employees of Hotel Agra Ashok.	None
The said interim order was extended up to the next date of hearing.	None
Our attention was also drawn to the share purchase agreement clause 9.4 in Article 9 which reads thus 9.4 The Purchaser will cause the Company to continue to employ all the regular employees of the Unit which have been transferred to the Company on the terms and conditions that shall not be inferior to the terms and conditions as applicable to the regular employees on the date of transfer of the Unit including with respect to the voluntary retirement scheme applicable to the Company as per the guidelines of the Department of Public Enterprises, if any, and terms set out in agreements entered into by ITDC in relation to such regular employees with staff workers unions associations.	None

None
Provided further, that no retrenchment of an Employee would be undertaken unless the affected Employee is given benefits which are higher of (a) the voluntary retirement scheme applicable to the Company as per the guidelines of the Department of Public Enterprises as of the date hereof and (b) the benefits compensation required to be statutorily given to an employee under applicable law.(v) the Company will only undertake dismissal or termination of the services of the employees on account of disciplinary action in accordance with the applicable staff regulations.(vi) in respect of contract employees the terms and conditions of the relevant contracts shall be fully observed by the Company and the Purchaser shall keep Government and ITDC indemnified against damages, losses or claims resulting on account of the Company failing to observe any of the terms and conditions of such contracts.	None
Our attention was also drawn to the order dated 01.02.2002 and, in particular, last para of page 3 of the said order referring to the status quo order passed by the High Court regarding service conditions of Class III and IV employees of the Hotel.	None
Our attention was also invited to clause 3.3(d) and 3.5.	None
Learned senior counsel submitted that the employees consent is necessary before transfer and cited Jawaharlal Nehru University vs. Dr. K.S. Jawatkar and Others, 1989 Supp (1) SCC 679 .	None
In this case, the Jawaharlal Nehru University, under Section 5(2) of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Act, 1966, established a Centre of Postgraduate studies at Imphal and appointed the respondent as Assistant Professor on a regular basis and also confirmed him w.e.f. 29.08.1979.	None
In 1981, the University decided to transfer the Centre to the Manipur University.	None
Under Section 1(4) of the Manipur University Act, 1980, the Governor of Manipur made an order which provided for transfer of the members of the faculties of the Centre to the Manipur University.	None
The question was whether the transfer of the Centre resulted in transfer of the respondents service to the Manipur University.	None
Answering in negative and rejecting the Jawaharlal	None
Nehru Universitys appeal, this Court held The respondent continues to be an employee of the appellant University.	None
The contract of service entered into by the respondent was a contract with the appellant University and no law can convert that contract into a contract between the respondent and the Manipur University without simultaneously making it either expressly or by necessary implication, subject to the respondents consent.	None
The provision in Manipur University Act for the transfer of the services of the staff working at the said Centre must be construed as enabling such transfer with the consent of the employee concerned.	None
Since the transfer of the Centre could not result in automatic transfer of the respondents service, he continues in the employment of the appellant University.	None
The above judgment is distinguishable on facts and on law.	Reasoning
The Jawaharlal Nehru University case (supra) would indicate that, in that case there was a purported transfer of the employee from Jawaharlal Nehru University to the Manipur University without his consent.	Reasoning
Admittedly the JNU did not exercise any control over Manipur University.	Reasoning
In the instant case, the transfer was from ITDC Ltd. to respondent No.3 Company, the shareholding pattern of the two companies were exactly the same.	Reasoning
Therefore, it did not make any difference to the employees, especially, when the scheme of demerger itself provide that the employee will continue in service of the respondent No.3 with full benefits including continuity in service.	Reasoning
The provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 were not involved in the JNUs case.	Reasoning
Further the two Universities were totally unconnected entities hence the ratio of that judgment, in our opinion, is not applicable to the facts in hand.	Reasoning
Even in the judgment of this Court, in JNU in para 8 it has been observed that at worst this would not impinge upon the validity of the demerger scheme.	None
The effect of that would be that the employee would be deemed to have retrenched and would be entitled to compensation as such in accordance with law.	Reasoning
In the instant case, the employees never claimed that they may be considered as retrenched.	Reasoning
Even if it is the claim of the petitioners that they have been retrenched, the writ petition is not the appropriate proceedings and the petitioners were required to institute appropriate proceedings as per the industrial labour laws.	Reasoning
Mr. M.L.Bhat, learned senior counsel also cited Nokes vs. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd. (1941) 11 Company Cases 83 House of Lords for the proposition that a free citizen in exercise of his freedom is entitled to chose the employer whom he promises to serve, so that the right to his services cannot be transferred from one employer to another without his consent.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Court was considering the whole question, however, as to whether Section 154 of the Companies Act, 1929 provides a statutory exception to that principle.	None
The Lord Chancellor came to the conclusion that the contracts of personal service are not automatically transferred by an order made under Section 154.	None
The House of Lords stated as under When the Court makes an order under Section 154 of the Companies Act, 1929, transferring all the property and liabilities of the transferor company to the transferee company, a contract previously existing between an individual and the transferor company does not automatically become a contract between the individual and the transferee company.	None
The fundamental principle of common law that a free citizen is entitled to choose his employer, so that the right to his services cannot be transferred from one employer to another without his consent, is not abrogated by the order which could be made under the section.	None
To effect such an alteration would require explicit clear words.	None
The right to the service of an employee is not the property of the transferor company.	None
Mr.Jayant Nath, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in T.C. No. 76 of 2002 invited our attention to the prayer in the writ petition and the salient features of the scheme of arrangement and the order passed by the Department of Company Affairs dated 01.02.2002 allowing the scheme under Section 391 of the Act.22.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel in his reply submitted that there will not be any difficulty to continue to employ all the regular employees of the Union which have been transferred to the Company on the terms and conditions and the terms set out in the agreement entered into by ITDC in relation to such regular employees with staff workers unions associations.	Arguments of Respondent
He further proceeded to submit that, if there is breach of the obligation under the scheme, the employees can always approach the appropriate forum for redressal.	Arguments of Respondent
He also invited our attention to the reply filed by the respective respondents objecting to the prayer asked for in the writ petition.	Arguments of Respondent
We have given our thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions made by the respective counsel appearing for the respective parties.	Reasoning
In our opinion, the present writ petitions filed by the employees merits to be dismissed.	Reasoning
Since disinvestment was a policy decision of the Government of India.	Reasoning
This Court also has held that the said policy decision should be least interfered in judicial review and that the Government employees have no absolute right under Article 14, 21 and 311 of the Constitution of India and that the Government can abolish the post itself.	Reasoning
In the present case, the petitioners are not government servants and are merely employees of a public sector undertaking.	Reasoning
This apart, the service conditions of the petitioners are being protected under the new management on the disinvestment of the Hotel and the fact that other hotels are also in an advanced stage of disinvestment in pursuance of the policy decision taken by the Government of India for disinvestment of the hotel units.	Reasoning
We see no reason to interfere with the aforesaid decision.	Reasoning
In case ultimately the petitioners are aggrieved by any aspect of terms of reference and formalization of agreement and completion of disinvestment it is always open to the petitioners to approach the courts for redressal of their grievances.24.	Reasoning
We have already extracted Clause 9.4 of the share purchase agreement dated 07.02.2002 in paragraphs supra.	Reasoning
In our view, the decision of the Government of India to divest the property was a policy decision which was not in any manner contrary to the law of the land.	Reasoning
Similar policy decision of the Government of India to disinvest 51 of this share holding in Bharat Aluminium Company Limited referred to as Balco was challenged before this Court and this Court has dealt with the scope of the judicial review in such economic policy decisions.	Reasoning
This Court rejected the contention that the sale of the shares of the Government of India in Balco was legal and the employees of Balco have ceased to be employees of a government company.	Reasoning
However, it is stated that the service conditions of the employees were not affected by the transfer of the shares.25.	Reasoning
We have also carefully perused the scheme.	Reasoning
It is evident from the scheme itself that all the employees were to be retained as stipulated in the transfer documents on the same terms and conditions of service for 1 year and they were entitled for payment of gratuity and provident fund as per the then existing scheme.	Reasoning
The terms and conditions of service applicable to the employees was not in any way be less favourable than those applicable to them immediately on the date thereof.	Reasoning
The relevant provisions of the transfer documents relating to disinvestment of Hotel Agra Ashok are being reproduced herein below Clause 3.2 (d) of the Scheme of Arrangement reads as follows with effect from the appointed date, all employees of the Transferor engaged in the Transferred Undertaking shall become the employees of the Transferee on the terms and conditions on which they are engaged as on the Appointed Date by the Transferor without any interruption of services as a result of this Scheme.	None
The Transferee agrees that the services of all such employees with the Transferred Undertaking upto the Appointed Date shall be taken into account for purposes of all retirement benefits to which they may be eligible in the Transferor on the Appointed Date.	None
In view of the above, we are of the opinion that the apprehension of the employees is baseless and is liable to be rejected.27.	Reasoning
It is also pertinent to notice that ITDC has not participated in the disinvestment process as the same was carried out by the Ministry of Disinvestment, Government of India.	Reasoning
The safeguards regarding the service conditions of the employees have been duly provided in the transfer document i.e. demerger scheme and share purchase agreement.	Reasoning
This Court also in Balco Employees Union (Regd.) vs. Union of India and Others, (2002) 2 SCC 333 held that the employees of the company registered under the Indian Companies Act do not have any vested right to continue to enjoy the status of the employee of an instrumentality of the State.28.	Reasoning
In the instant case, with the intention to promote the scheme of disinvestment, the Government issued an advertisement to outright sale of 6 hotels and long term lease for 2 hotels.	Reasoning
The property of respondent No.1 was demerged in the name of the new company with the approval of the Company Law Board.	Reasoning
We have perused the order approving the scheme of arrangement as annexed and marked as AnnexureC(a)/2.	None
All the employees after the creation of the new company were shifted to the new company which was also a subsidiary company of ITDC.	None
Respondent No.1 invited tenders for sale of the Hotel.	Reasoning
The offer made by Respondent Nos. 4 and 5 was accepted by respondent No.1 as successful bidder and accordingly, the shares of Hotel Yamuna View Private Limited were transferred under share purchase agreement dated 07.02.2002.	Reasoning
It is pertinent to notice that at the time of inviting bid, no such liabilities of VRS to the employees were shown against Hotel Agra Ashok.	Reasoning
All the liabilities were mentioned in the balance sheet of the company including property tax and water tax to be deposited with the Cantonment Board.	Reasoning
Respondent Nos. 4 and 5 got the shares of Hotel Yamuna Private Limited transferred in their favour while share transfer agreement dated 07.02.2002 wherein certain conditions were put in by respondent No.1 keeping in mind the order of the High Court for maintaining the status quo of the class III and IV employees.	Reasoning
Pursuant to the agreement, the Management of the Hotel was transferred to respondent No.4.29.	None
The employees have also challenged the non implementation of VRS in respect of the employees of Hotel Agra Ashok.	Issue
In our view, the petitioners employees cannot claim parity in respect of other employees working under ITDC in different properties who have been granted benefits under VRS as the scheme was never made applicable to the employees working with the present property.	Reasoning
No disclosure of any such introduction of VRS was given by ITDC at the time of sale, neither was any amount to be deposited by the purchaser.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, of the opinion that respondent Nos. 4 and 5 is under no obligation to float the VRS scheme because in para 9(4), the VRS has to be given only when company retrenches its regular employees.	Reasoning
But here the company is ready to continue with its employees with the same terms and conditions mentioned in the share purchase agreement.	Reasoning
The employees are unwilling to continue on the same terms and, therefore, they cannot compel the management to introduce VRS scheme.	Reasoning
When the share purchase agreement was executed with respondent No.5, then there was no scheme introduced for grant of VRS because prior to the sale the petitioners were employees of ITDC and not of Hotel Yamuna View Limited.	Reasoning
They have already objected their transfer to Hotel Yamuna Private Limited.	Reasoning
The petitioners are demanding VRS from ITDC because as per the orders dated 13.12.2001 and 05.03.2002 of the Allahabad High Court, the employees of Hotel Agra Ashok cannot be transferred to the new company Hotel Yamuna Private Limited.	Reasoning
With intention to escape the liability of contempt, the ITDC specifically asked the buyer to maintain the service conditions of the employees on the same terms by entering into a share purchase agreement, however, no condition in this agreement was mentioned for offering VRS.	Reasoning
In other words, a VRS scheme for employees of Ashok Travels Tours was introduced by circular dated 02.03.2001 but there was no policy for VRS regarding Hotel Agra Ashok.	Reasoning
Also under Clause 8 of the said circular regarding introduction of VRS, it is clearly stated that the scheme does not confer any right whatsoever on any employee to have their request for voluntary retirement accepted.	Reasoning
The respondent has also no such obligation under para 94 (IV).	None
This Court in a recent judgment in the case of Board of Trustees, Visakhapatnam Port Trust Others vs. T.S.N. Raju and Another, 2006 (9) Scale 55 (Dr. AR.	None
Lakshmanan and Tarun Chatterjee, JJ) while considering the scheme of voluntary retirement applicable to Port Trusts considered the scope of entitlement to avail the benefit of the scheme.	None
This Court held that the Chairman of the Port Trust has absolute right either to accept or not to accept the applications filed by the employees for retirement and the request of employees seeking voluntary retirement was not to take effect until and unless it was accepted in writing by the Port Trust Authorities.	None
This Court held in para 35 as under In our opinion, the request of the employees seeking voluntary retirement was not to take effect until and unless it was accepted in writing by the Port Trust Authorities.	None
The Port Trust Authorities had the absolute discretion whether to accept or reject the request of the employee seeking voluntary retirement under the scheme.	None
There is no assurance that such an application would be accepted without any consideration.	None
The process of acceptance of an offer made by an employee was in the discretion of the Port Trust.	None
We, therefore, have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the VRS was not a proposal or an offer but merely an invitation to treat and the applications filed by the employees constituted an offer.	None
As already noticed, the Government of India constituted the Disinvestment Commission and accepted the recommendation of the said Commission.	None
A decision was taken by InterMinisterial Group and at the level of the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment to divest each property individually rather than altogether or in groups.32.	Reasoning
It is also beneficial for us to refer to the judgment of Balco Employees Union (Regd.)	Reasoning
vs. Union of India and Others (supra) by which this Court has dealt with the scope of the judicial review in such economic policy decisions.	Reasoning
This Court held as follows Applying the analogy, just as the Court does not sit over the policy of the Parliament in enacting the law, similarly, it is not for this Court to examine whether the policy of this disinvestment is desirable or not Process of disinvestment is a policy decision involving complex economic factors.	None
The Courts have consistently refrained from interfering with economic decisions as it has been recognised that economic expediencies lack adjudicative disposition and unless the economic decision, based on economic expediencies, is demonstrated to be so violative of constitutional or legal limits on power or so abhorrent to reason, that the Courts would decline to interfere.	None
In matters relating to economic issues, the Government has, while taking a decision, right to trial and error as long as both trial and error are bona fide and within limits of authority92.	None
In a democracy it is the prerogative of each elected Government to follow its own policy.	None
Often a change in Government may result in the shift in focus or change in economic policies.	None
Any such change may result in adversely affecting some vested interests.	None
Unless any illegality is committed in the execution of the policy or the same is contrary to law or mala fide, a decision bringing about change cannot per se be interfered with by the Court.93.	None
Wisdom and advisability of economic policies are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review unless it can be demonstrated that the policy is contrary to any statutory provision or the Constitution.	None
In other words, it is not for the Courts to consider relative merits of different economic polices and consider whether a wiser or better one can be evolved.	None
For testing the correctness of a policy, the appropriate forum is Parliament and not the Courts98.	None
In the case of a policy decision on economic matters, the courts should be very circumspect in conducting any enquiry or investigation and must be most reluctant to impugn the judgment of the experts who may have arrived at a conclusion unless the Court is satisfied that there is illegality in the decision itself.	None
In the instant case, the Government has acted on advice of experts before taking a decision to disinvest its shares in ITDC Limited.	Reasoning
Even thereafter, through a fair and transparent process as detailed in the reply affidavit of the Union of India, the Government has ensured that it has got the best price for its shares.	Reasoning
It is also pertinent to notice that the Government has not received any other higher offer.	Reasoning
The contention of the learned senior counsel for the writ petitioners that the price is less has not been supported by any documentary evidence.	Reasoning
In similar situation, this Court has observed in Balco Employees Union case (supra) as follows 65.	None
It is not for this Court to consider whether the price which was fixed by the Evaluation Committee at Rs.551.5 crores was correct or not.	None
What has to be seen in exercise of judicial review of administrative action is to examine whether proper procedure has been followed and whether the reserve price which was fixed is arbitrarily low and on the face of it, unacceptable.66	None
When proper procedure has been followed, as in this case, and an offer is made of a price more than the reserve price then there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the decision of the Government to accept the offer of Sterlite is in any way vitiated.	None
The very same contention raised by the employees in the instant case was raised by the employees of Balco when the Government of India disinvested its majority shares in Balco.	None
This Court rejected the contention that the sale of the shares of the Government of India in Balco was legal as the employees of Balco have ceased to be employees of a Government Company.	Reasoning
It was, inter alia, observed as follows 47.	None
Even though the workers may have interest in the manner in which the Company is conducting its business, inasmuch as its policy decision may have an impact on the workers rights, nevertheless it is an incidence of service for an employee to accept a decision of the employer which has been honestly taken and which is not contrary to law.	None
Even a government servant, having the protection of not only Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution but also of Article 311, has no absolute right to remain in service.	None
For example, apart from cases of disciplinary action, the services of government servants can be terminated if posts are abolished.	None
If such employee cannot make a grievance based on part III of the Constitution or Article 311 then it cannot stand to reason that like the petitioners, nongovernment employees working in a company which by reason of judicial pronouncement may be regarded as a State for the purpose of part III of the Constitution, can claim a superior or a better right than a government servant and impugn its change of status48.	None
If the abolition of a post pursuant to a policy decision does not attract the provisions of Article 311 of the Constitution as held in State of Haryana v. Des Raj Sangar and Anr.	None
on the same parity of reasoning, the policy of disinvestment cannot be faulted if as a result thereof the employees lose their rights or protection under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.	None
In other words, the existence of rights of protection under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution cannot possibly have the effect of vetoing the Governments right to disinvest.	None
Nor can the employees claim a right of continuous consultation at different stages of the disinvestment process.	None
If the disinvestment process is gone through without contravening any law, then the normal consequences as a result of disinvestment must follow.49.	None
The Government could have run the industry departmentally or in any other form.	None
When it chooses to run an industry by forming a company and it becomes its shareholder then under the provisions of the Companies Act as a shareholder, it would have a right to transfer its shares.	None
When persons seek and get employment with such a company registered under the Companies Act, it must be presumed that they accept the right of the directors and the shareholders to conduct the affairs of the company in accordance with law and at the same time they can exercise the right to sell their shares.	None
We may also usefully refer to the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of (Southern Structurals Staff Union vs. Southern Structurals Ltd.) (1994) 81 Comp.	None
Cases 389 (Mad) wherein the Madras High Court held as follows The employees have no vested right in the employer company continuing to be a government company or other authority for the purpose of Article 12 of the Constitution of India The status so conferred on the employees does not prevent the Government from disinvesting nor does it make the consent of the employees a necessary precondition for disinvestment.	None
In the case of Balco, as well as in the present case, the Government of India has ensured that the interest of the workmen are fully protected.	Reasoning

Reasoning
A perusal of paragraphs 23, 24, 54, 55 and 56 of the judgment of this Court in Balco would indicate that the above protection of the workers interest in similar circumstances has been held by this Court to be adequate and lawful.	Reasoning
