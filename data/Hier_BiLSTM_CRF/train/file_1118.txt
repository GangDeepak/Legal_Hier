This application was opposed by the petitioners as also the respondent nos.	Facts

The Honble Competent Authority despite the fact that the Advocate for the respondent no. 3 submitting that she is not filing the rejoinder has taken the rejoinder on file and despite the fact that the matter was adjourned for filing surrejoinder hearing on 19th June 2012, proponed the same to 12th June 2012 without giving Notice to the parties and passed a judgment and order on 12th June 2012 stating that the matter was closed for order on 21st May 2012.	Facts
Annexed hereto and marked as Exhibit A is the copy of the Order and Judgment dated 12th June 2012 passed by Respondent no. 1 viz.	Facts
the Deputy District Registrar (the Competent Authority) under section 5A of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) Act, 1963 entitling the respondents no. 3 to an order for Unilateral Conveyance executed as Deemed Conveyance in their favour for land admeasuring gross plot area entitlement of 2634.36 sq. mtrs and net plot area of 2451.12 sq mtrs out of the common plot of land bearing Hissa No. 9 10 of survey No. 422 and Hissa No. 5 3 (part) of survey no. 423 corresponding CTS no.

no. BDR9/5980/2012 with the Respondent no.	None
2.	Facts
The said Conveyance is thus bad in law and improper as no notice under the Registration Act was given to the petitioners.?12.	Facts
In paragraphs (2) and (3) of the counter affidavit filed before the High Court, respondent No.1 averred as under?2.	Facts
I say and submit that, the matter was heard on many occasions viz.	Facts
on 23.1.2012, 27.2.2012, 7.3.2012, 13.3.2012, 19.3.2012, 27.3.2012, 3.4.2012, 17.4.2012, 7.5.2012 and 15.5.2012.	Facts
Petitioners have been given ample opportunity by my predecessor to file their say in the interest of natural justice.	Facts
Petitioners have already filed written reply on 19.3.2012 and thereafter opportunity of arguing the matter was given to the Petitioners on 3.4.2012.	Facts
Advocate of Applicant society submitted that she doesnt want to file rejoinder and was ready for arguments.	Facts
There after it was incumbent on Petitioners to argue the matter or else to file written arguments.	Facts
On the same date matter was adjourned for arguments to 17.4.2012.	Facts
Advocate for Petitioners neither raise any objections nor he pleaded for longer date.	Facts
Thereafter also on 17.4.2012 Advocate for Applicant society filed rejoinder and copy was served on Petitioners on 17.5.2012.	Facts
Petitioners were directed to file written arguments on or before next hearing which was fixed on 15.5.2012.	Facts
On 15.5.2012 also Petitioners didnt file written arguments and submitted letter for keeping matter after 9.6.2012.	Facts
Therefore matter was fixed on 19.6.2012.	Facts
But later on it was revealed that on 19.6.2012 near about 41 Revision Applications were listed on the board for hearing before this respondent and therefore it was decided to prepone the matter to 21.5.2012 and notices to that effect were sent to Petitioners by registered post but this office has not received acknowledgement from the postal department.3.	Facts
I say and submit that, the decision of preponing the matter was taken by my predecessor solely in bonafide interest with a view to complete the proceeding within a period of six months as contemplated in Section 11(4) of MOFA 1963.?(emphasis added)13.	Facts
Along with the writ petition, the appellants filed an application for interim stay.	Facts
The learned Single Judge took cognizance of the assertion made in the writ petition that notice of preponement of the date of hearing was not served upon them, but refused to grant stay on the ground that the writ petition was filed after four months of the order passed by respondent No.1 and during the intervening period conveyance deed had already been registered for a sum of Rs.95 lacs and the Society and respondent No.3 had entered into development agreements with builders.14.	Facts
Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for the appellants argued that the order passed by respondent No.1 is liable to be declared as nullity because he arbitrarily preponed the date of hearing and decided the application of respondent No.3 without bothering to find out whether the notice issued to the parties about the changed date had been delivered served.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Rohatgi referred to the English translation of the order sheets recorded by respondent No.1, xerox copies of communications dated 15.2.2013 sent by Senior Superintendant of Post Offices, Mumbai City (North) to Ms. Pritha Dave, counsel for respondent No.3 and the counter filed on behalf of respondent No.1 before the High Court to show that the notice issued in terms of the direction given by respondent No.1 on 16.5.2012 was not served upon the appellants.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel then argued that due to non service of notice, the appellants could not appear on 21.5.2012 and on that account their cause has been seriously prejudiced.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Rohatgi then submitted that the absence of the counsel representatives of all the parties except respondent No.3 on 21.5.2012 should have alerted respondent No.1 that there was something wrong with the service of notice and prompted him to make an inquiry to ascertain whether the notice had been served on all the parties, but the concerned officer deliberately did not take any action in this regard and proceeded to close the matter for orders.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Rohatgi argued that the explanation given by respondent No.1 for preponing the date of hearing, i.e., fixation of excess number of cases on the particular date, i.e., 19.6.2012 should not be accepted because even on 15.5.2012, the concerned officer must have been aware of the fact that he had already fixed large number of cases on 19.6.2012.15.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for respondent No.3, supported the decision of respondent No.1 to prepone the date of hearing by pointing out that the officer concerned was compelled to do so because he was required to decide the application within six months of its institution.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Divan referred to letter dated 15/18.2.2013 sent by Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, Mumbai City (North 2) to Ms. Pritha Dave and argued that the intimation given to the appellants?	Arguments of Respondent
counsel was sufficient to make them aware of the decision taken by respondent No.1 to prepone the date of hearing.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Divan submitted that the appellants cannot plead denial of hearing by respondent No.1 as the ground for quashing the order passed by him because their advocate had been duly intimated about the changed date of hearing.	Arguments of Respondent
However, learned senior counsel could not offer any clarification about the delivery of notice to the sender on 22.5.2012.	Arguments of Respondent
We have considered the respective arguments and carefully scrutinized the record.	None
By producing xerox copies of the receipt of speed post and two communications dated 15.2.2013 sent by Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, Mumbai City (North) to Ms. Pritha Dave, respondent No.3 has made an attempt to show that the appellants had been informed about the changed date of hearing, but we have not felt convinced.	Reasoning
In the first place, the justification offered for preponement of the date of hearing is too weak to be accepted.	Reasoning
It is neither the pleaded case of respondent Nos. 1 and 3 nor it has been argued before us that the application filed by respondent No.3 was the only one dealt with by the officer concerned.	Reasoning
Rather, the assertion contained in the counter filed by respondent No.1 before the High Court shows that large number of similar cases were handled by the officer.	Reasoning
Therefore, it can be presumed that he was aware of the imperative to decide the application within six months.	Reasoning
Notwithstanding this, respondent No.1 fixed large number of cases on 19.6.2012.	Reasoning
Why he did so has not been explained.	Reasoning
Why he singled out the application of respondent No.3 for preponing the date of hearing has also not been explained.	Reasoning
Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the action of respondent No.1 to prepone the date of hearing of the application was founded on extraneous reasons and was totally unwarranted and unjustified.18.	Reasoning
Secondly, the documents produced before this Court unmistakably show that notice issued to the appellants to apprise them about the changed date of hearing was not delivered to them.	Reasoning
The statement made in paragraph (Z) of the counter affidavit filed by respondent No.1 substantially supports the appellants?	Reasoning
assertion that they had not received intimation about preponement of the date of hearing.	Reasoning
It also belies the assertion of respondent No.3 that notice was delivered to the appellants before the date of hearing, i.e., 21.5.2012.	Reasoning
If the notice had been duly served upon the appellants, then respondent No.1 would have produced the receipt of delivery.	Reasoning
His failure to do so leads to an irresistible inference that the appellants were not made aware of the fact that the date of hearing had been changed from 19.6.2012 to 21.5.2012.	Reasoning
The documents produced by respondent No.3 do not help us in resolving the controversy regarding service of notice on the appellants.	Reasoning
The contents of these documents only adds to the confusion.	Reasoning
If the second letter dated 15.2.2013 sent by the Senior Superintendent of Post Office was delivered on 22.5.2012 then we have no option but to hold that the notice issued by the office of respondent No.1 was delivered to the addressee on 22.5.2012, i.e., one day after the date fixed for hearing.19.	Reasoning
As a corollary to the above findings, it must be held that order dated 12.6.2012 passed by respondent No.1 is vitiated due to violation of the rule of audi alteram partem and is liable to be set aside.20.	Decision
In the result, the appeal is allowed.	Decision
The impugned order as also order dated 12.6.2012 passed by respondent No.1 are set aside and the matter is remitted to respondent No.1 for fresh disposal of the application filed by respondent No.3 for grant of certificate for unilateral execution of conveyance.	Decision
Respondent No.1 shall make an endeavour to decide the application of respondent No.3 within a period of three months from the date of receipt production of a copy of this judgment without being influenced by order dated 12.6.2012.	Decision
