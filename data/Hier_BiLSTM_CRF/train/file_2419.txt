(e) disputed income, in relation, to an assessment year means the whole or so much of the total income as is relatable to the disputed tax (f) disputed tax means the total tax determined the payable in respect of an assessment year under any direct tax enactment but which remains unpaid as on the date of making the declaration under Section 88	None
xxx xxx xxx (m) tax arrear means  (i) in relation to direct tax enactment, the amount of tax penalty or interest determined on or before the 31st day of March, 1998 under that enactment in respect of an assessment year as modified in consequence of giving effect to an appellate order but remaining unpaid on the date of declarationSection 88  Subject to the provisions of this Scheme, where any person makes, On or after the 1st day of September, 1998 but on or before the 31st day of December, 1998, a declaration to the designated authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 89 in respect of tax arrear, then, notwithstanding anything contained in any direct tax enactment or indirect tax enactment or any other provision for any law for the time being in force, the amount payable under the Scheme by the declarant shall be determined at the rates specified hereunder, namely (a) Where the tax arrear is a payable under the Incometax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961), (i) in the case of a declarant being a company or a firm, at the rate of thirtyfive percent of the disputed income Section 90  (1) Within sixty days from the date of receipt of the declaration under Section 89, the designated authority shall, by order, determine the amount payable by the declarant in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme and grant a certificate in such form as may be prescribed to the declarant setting forth therein the particulars of the tax arrear and the sum payable after such determination towards full and final settlement of tax arrears Section 94  	None
For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that, save as otherwise expressly provided in Subsection (3) of Section 90, nothing contained in this Scheme shall be construed as conferring any benefit, concession or immunity on the declarant in any assessment or proceedings other than those in relation to which the declaration has been made.	None
The Scheme of the KVSS is to cut short litigations pertaining to taxes which were frittering away the energy of the Revenue Department and to encourage litigants to come forward and pay up a reasonable amount of tax payable in accordance with the Scheme after declaration thereunder.	None
The learned Senior Counsel for the appellant contended that once the assessment for the entire year was settled by following the provisions of the Scheme and the Designated Authority after application of mind had made an order under Section 90, which was complied with by making payment of the tax computed under the Scheme, there was no question of reopening any issue which were subject matters of the order of the Designated Authority.	Arguments of Petitioner
He urged that the order of the Designated Authority is not mechanically passed, but upon careful scrutiny of all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the declarant assessee and intended to bring about certain legal consequence under the KVSS.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was not open to the Income Tax Authorities to put back the clock by going back thereupon.	Arguments of Petitioner
The order of the Designated Authority is conclusive on all items heads, which go into the computation of the total income of the assessee and not confined only to the heads of income in respect of which an appeal or reference may be pending.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel for the Revenue however, emphasized that the expression determined and payable used in Section 87 gives a clue to understanding the Section.	Arguments of Respondent
He contended that, in the case of the present appellant, the giving effect order made by the CIT (Appeals) had not been fully worked out by the Assessing Officer as income under the four heads i.e. a) disallowance of bad debts to the extent of Rs.	Arguments of Respondent
68,02,046.00 b) income from house property to the extent of Rs.	None
27,93,977.00 c) dispute regarding capital gains to the extent of Rs. 4,00,000.00 and d) disallowance under Rule 6D amounting to Rs.	None
31,963.00 had not been finally computed by the Assessing Authority after the findings of the Assessing Authority on these four heads were set aside by the CIT (Appeals) and the matter was remitted to the Assessing Authority.	None
It is urged that the sum total of these amounts would be in the vicinity of Rs. 99 lacs, while the dispute before the Tribunal was only on fined to disallowance of interest (Rs. 27,14,00.00), disallowance of depreciation (Rs. 2,18,000.00) and disallowance in respect of premium paid (Rs. 3,57,153.00).	Arguments of Respondent
The demand notice issued was only in respect of these items totalling Rs. 33,65,298.00, this amount which had been declared under the KVSS on which the appellant paid paltry amount of Rs. 9,35,888.00 as tax in full and final settlement.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also contended that the appellant has escaped payment of tax on a large income of approximately Rs. 99,00,000.00 in respect of bad debts, income from house property, capital gains and disallowance under Rule 6D as these disputed issues were never determined by the Assessing Officer.	Arguments of Respondent
The Designated Authority had assessed the income of the appellant at Rs. 33,65,298.00 only on the basis of KVSS and that he could not have worked out the assessable income as the Assessing Officer had not yet determined the income under the above four heads.	Arguments of Respondent
We are unable to accept the contention urged on behalf of the Revenue on both counts.	Reasoning
In the first place, we are unable to accept that the assessing Officer in his order dated 25.09.1998, while giving effect to the order of CIT (Appeals), had not taken account of the four major heads of dispute amounting to about Rs. 99 lacs.	Reasoning
A reference to that order (which is at Exhibit C1 to the Writ Petition) makes the situation clear.	Reasoning
The Assessing officer starts by saying Consequent upon the order of the CIT(A) C1/AP.72/9596 dated 16.3.1998 the total income of the assessee is recomputed as under Then he starts with the figure of loss arrived at by his order dated 27.3.95 at Rs. 54,28,077.00 and add thereto to the following items	None
Chart Finally, he further deducts the relief allowed on account of setaside issues Chart After making these calculations, he arrived at the revised income Rs. 33,65,298.00.	None
Finally, he appends a note on the foot of the order saying, the following points are set aside by the CIT(A) to be done afresh after giving an opportunity to the assessee of being heard and indicates the four major heads.	None
A careful scrutiny of this order suggests that, even while giving effect to the CIT(Appeals) order, the Assessing Officer has taken account of bad debt amounting to Rs.	Reasoning
68,02,046.00 and amount treated as business income as per the Appellate Authority direction of Rs.	Reasoning
27,93,977.00 while working out the revised total income.	Reasoning
Out of the four items indicated at the end of the order item Nos. 1 and 2 (Income from house property Rs. 27,93,977.00 and claim of bad debt Rs. 68,02,046.00) have been deducted by the Assessing Authority, indicating that he agrees with the Assessees claim.	Reasoning
The Assessing Authority does not seem to have taken account of two other items (Capital gains Rs.	Reasoning
4,00,000.00 and Rule 6D disallowance Rs. 31,963.)	Reasoning
We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention that the Assessing Authority had not assessed the disputed heads while giving effect to the CIT(A)s order.	Reasoning
We are fortified in our conclusion by reason of the fact that no demand notice refund order could have been issued if the assessment was not complete.	Reasoning
If the Assessing Officer had not completely assessed the income after taking note of the four issues remitted to him, there was no question of determining the revised total income, much less was there any scope for issuing a demand notice refund order at that stage.	Reasoning
Hence, we are unable to accept that the Assessing Officer had not fully given effect to the CIT(Appeals) order with respect to the four major heads.	Reasoning
It is true that even after this order there was correspondence between the appellant and authorities with respect to disallowance of certain items of tax deducted at source as the appellantassessee was unable to produce documentary evidence, though it had furnished the necessary indemnity bonds.	Reasoning
That, however, was an outstanding dispute by which the assessee, if at all, could be aggrieved.	Reasoning
It is also pointed out that revised assessment order giving effect to the appellate order has not taken account of the heads of capital gain and Rule 6D disallowance totalling Rs. 4,31,963.00.	Reasoning
The grievance, any, on this count can only be made by the assessee and not the Revenue.	Reasoning
As far as the provisions of KVSS are concerned, we agree with the contention of the learned Senior Counsel for the assessee that the order to be made by the Designated Authority under Section 90 is a considered order which is intended to be conclusive in respect of tax arrears and sums payable after such determination towards full and final settlement of tax arrears.	Reasoning
Once the declarant makes payment of the amount so determined under Section 90, the immunity under Section 91 springs into effect.	Reasoning
We are also of the view that upon such declaration being made, tax arrears being determined, paid and certificate issued under the KVSS, there is no jurisdiction for the Assessing Officer to reopen the assessment by a notice under Section 143 of the Act except where the case falls under the proviso (2) of Subsection (1) of Section 90 as it is found that any material particular furnished in the declaration is found to be false.	Reasoning
In the present case, it is not the case of the Revenue that any material particular furnished by the appellantassessee in the declaration was found to be false.	Reasoning
Consequently, the Assessing Officer could not have reopened the assessment by a notice under Section 143 of the Act.	None
In our view, the High Court erred in both counts in dismissing the writ petition.	Decision
In the result, we allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and quash the notices under Section 142(1) of the Act dated 16.8.1999 and 30.12.1999 read with letters dated 16.8.1999, 30.12.1999 and 15.2.2000.	Decision
In the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.	None
