Dr. Abhishek Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants has challenged the action of the respondent solely on the ground of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.	Arguments of Petitioner
He has contended that the State largese in the form of the land, the subject matter of the litigation has been bestowed upon respondent No. 5 merely for a song without adhering to the settled norms of fair play and equity.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is contended that the respondent State, without issuing any advertisement or resorting to the procedure of auction and tender, has secretly leased out the land which has resulted in huge monetary loss worth crores of rupees to the State exchequer.	Arguments of Petitioner
Elaborating the arguments, it was submitted that the State Executive is not and should not act as free as an individual in selecting the recipient for its largesse, as has been allegedly done in this case.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Government cannot lay down arbitrary and capricious standards for choice of persons for the conferment of State benefits.	Arguments of Petitioner
Referring to a host of documents, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that the arbitrary action of the respondentState is writ large in this case.	Arguments of Petitioner
The respondents are stated to have not satisfied either the High Court or this Court about their bona fides in initiating, processing and concluding the lease agreement with respondent No. 5.	Arguments of Petitioner
Inviting our attention to the lease deed, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that the said document in fact was a sale deed in cloak of a lease agreement.	Arguments of Petitioner
The consideration of the sale deed has been termed to be on throw away price.	Arguments of Petitioner
Conceding that the appellants had not made allegations of mala fides against any one of the respondents, it is contended that though not actual but legal mala fides are discernible from the pleadings of the parties and the record produced by them.8.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra Shri K.K. Venugopal, Senior Counsel who was followed by Shri Altaf Ahmad, Additional Solicitor General contended that the writ petition is not a bona fide action of the appellants.	Arguments of Respondent
Four of whom are stated to be the erstwhile owners interested only to get back the land legally acquired from them.	Arguments of Respondent
The petition is stated to be suffering from unexplained delay and laches.	Arguments of Respondent
The appellants are stated to have not pleaded or argued the points including the plea of arbitrary action of the respondents before the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that in the light of the pleadings and the record produced before it, the High Court was justified in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellants.	Arguments of Respondent
The proposed setting up of the industry is stated to have provided job opportunities to more than 300 people and is likely to earn foreign exchange to the extent of Rs. 50 crores per year.	Arguments of Respondent
It is argued that there is no defect or error of law in the decision making process of the State Government by which the land has been leased out to respondent No. 5.	Arguments of Respondent
It is conceded that though the document executed between the parties is styled as a lease deed, yet in fact it is a sale as the whole of the then prevalent market value of the land has been paid by the respondent No. 5.	Arguments of Respondent
The lease deed is stated to have been got executed for keeping interests of the State alive in the land which in no way affects the public interest but in effect is adverse to the interests of the respondent No. 5.	Arguments of Respondent
The deed is stated to have been concluded on the basis of negotiations, a recognised method of transferring the State property.	Arguments of Respondent
The learned Single Judge formulated the three questions for his adjudication which read as under  Whether the writ petitioner Nos. 3 to 6 can as a matter of right get back the land which was acquired from the predecessorininterest or not ?(b) Whether a property which has been vested under the Acquisition Act, 1894 can be dealt with and or used by the State Government otherwise than public purpose or not ?	None
(c) Whether granting of lease of a vested land to a private company for the purpose of industrial development and for earning foreign exchange is public purpose or not.	None
Learned Counsel who appeared in the High Court for writ petitioners 3 to 6 conceded that his clients had no right to ask for return of the surplus land.	None
Relying upon the judgments of this Court in AIR 1977 SC 448 and 1997(2) SCC 627, the learned Single Judge held that once the property has been vested unto the Government under Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, neither the previous owner nor their successorsininterest can question the dealing and disposal of the property by the Government.	None
Referring to the decisions of this Court reported in AIR 1986 SC 72 and AIR 1986 SC 910 and analysing the facts of the case the learned Single Judge held  There are enough materials placed before me which unmistakably substantiate that Mr. Pals client has brought a promise and or hope that at least 400 employed youths would be provided in this industry.	None
This industry will also bring foreign exchange to the public exchequer nearly worth 40 crores per annum.	None
It is now accepted position that one of the prime economic policies of this country is to earn foreign exchange as much as possible.	None
So, in my view, when the State utilizes a land in furtherance of development of industry and or earning foreign exchange the same is nothing short of public purpose, notwithstanding a statement made in clause 16 of the lease deed.	None
The statements made in clause 16 of the lease at best operate as admission.	None
This admission however is displaced by the above fact to prove the fact of public purpose.	None
My view has been expressed accepting the decision of case reported in AIR 1978 Pat. 136.	None
Moreover, here the State Government instead of leaving the land being unutilised has gainfully utilized by granting long lease to Mr. Pals client with a premium of Rs. 71,59,820.80 which has gone to the State exchequer.	None
The construction of a slaughter house was also held to be a public purpose.	None
In appeal, while upholding the judgment of the learned Single Judge, the Division Bench dealt with the submissions of the appellants to the effect that the land should have been sold by public auction, if after acquisition it was not used for any other public purpose by the Government.	None
The Division Bench held that the surplus land in question need not have been sold in auction when the State had declared to utilise the land by leasing out the same for 99 years in favour of respondent No. 5.	None
Agreeing with the learned Single Judge, it was held by the Division Bench in appeal, that We are, however, of the opinion that this court is not at all required to be satisfied whether a surplus land has been utilised for a public purpose.	None
After acquisition of the land in accordance with the procedure established by law a surplus land has vested in the State free from all encumbrances.	None
Article 298 empowers the State to carry on any trade or business and make contracts for any purpose.	None
Finding that no allegations of mala fide and discrimination had been pleaded in the petition, the State Government was held competent to enter into contracts with private persons for disposal of the property irrespective of the purpose of such acquisition or disposition subject only to the condition of compliance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution.	None
The appellants were held to be having no locus standi to question the agreement executed between the respondentState and the respondent No. 5.	None
As noticed earlier, Dr. Abhishek Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants has not challenged the legality or constitutionality of the lease agreement or the action of the respondentState on the grounds alleged in the writ petition.	None
He has conceded that the erstwhile owners of the land had no right to ask for the return of the land to them.	None
Similarly, the Vegetarian Congress, petitioner No. 5 was not justified in seeking the relief of restraining the respondents from utilising the land for the purposes of abattoir at Mourigram.	None
The sole point urged before us was with respect to the alleged arbitrariness of the State Government.	None
To appreciate the only submission made before us we scanned the writ petition, the counteraffidavit and the accompanying documents and found that no basis for such a plea was laid in the writ petition and the arguments addressed before the Division Bench were not refereable any pleadings.	None
It is contended that as the issue had specifically been pleaded in the appeal before the High Court and has been urged in the grounds of appeal in this Court, a decision on the point was warranted, notwithstanding the absence of sufficient pleadings.	None
We are not impressed with such an argument.	None
Whether any advertisement was issued or not, or whether public auction or floating of tenders should have been dispensed with or not, are such matters which require pleadings in order to enable the State Government to explain or justify their action in the circumstances of the case.	None
The appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court and in this Court being in continuation of the original proceedings in the form of writ petition, cannot enlarge the scope of inquiry at this belated stage.	None
In the absence of specific allegations of the mala fides attributed to any of the respondents, it cannot be said that mere violation of some alleged statutory provisions are safeguards as spelt out by this Court, would render the State action to be arbitrary in all cases.	None
To buttress his arguments, the learned counsel for the appellants submitted that as the land was transferred to respondent No. 5 for a song and at throw away price, resulting in corresponding loss to the State exchequer, it reflected the legal mala fides and the arbitrary action of the respondents.	None
The argument has to be noted to be rejected inasmuch as nowhere in their writ petition the appellants had alleged that the land had been sold at a throw away price.	None
Referring to the lease agreement it is contended that as in fact transacting is sale under the cloak of lease, the legal mala fides are writ large exhibition the arbitration (arbitrary ?)	None
action of the respondents.	None
Learned Counsel appearing for the respondents have brought to our notice that in fact the value charged from respondents No. 5 was the market value of the land and not lease money as urged.	None
In this regard, in the counteraffidavit filed on behalf of the respondent No. 1 in this Court it is stated In order that the proper and correct lease premium and lease rent were arrived at a valuation of the land in question was caused to be made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer.	None
By the memo No. 49(c) dated 12th January, 1994 of the District Magistrate, Howrah, a copy whereof is annexed hereto and marked Annexure R1/9, the Valuation Report (in L.V. Case No. 46/93) was forwarded to the Secretary, ARD Department of the Government of West Bengal Officer.	None
A photocopy of the said valuation report is annexed hereto and marked Annexure R1/9.	None
From the memo dated 12.1.1994 it would be seen that a part of the land which was ultimately leased out to the respondent No. 5 was under water and hence demarcation could be done only in respect of 30 acres of the land.	None
On the basis of the said valuation the selami, i.e., lease premium, annual rent and cess payable by the respondent No. 5 for the lease to be granted were calculated as per the circular as issued by the Land and Land Reforms Department of the State Government for determination of land revenue and Board of Revenue, West Bengal respectively, copies whereof are annexed hereto and marked Annexure R1/10.	None
Copy of the documents evidencing the manner in which the value of the lands at both Mourigram and Durgapur were arrived at and the lease premium, annual rent, cess etc., arrived is annexed hereto and marked Annexure R1/11.	None
The lease premium so arrived at was of a sum of Rs.	None
71,59,820.80 on the basis of the market value of the land then prevailing.	None
The ground rent arrived at was Rs. 418/ per annum and cess Rs. 296/ per annum without granting any concessions whatsoever.	None
From the abovementioned valuation report of the Land Acquisition Officer, the manner in which the market value of the said land which was to be given on lease basis to the respondent No. 5 for setting up of the abovementioned project and the documents relied upon for the said purpose, which included five numbers of executed lease deeds as available in the SubRegistry Office at Howrah for the year 1992 and applying appreciation percentage thereon, as well as the order of the Collector dated 29th April, 1993 in a land acquisition case were take into account.	None
The same clearly shows that, contrary to what had been alleged in the Special Leave Petition, the lease in question has been granted taking into consideration the market price of subject land on the relevant date.	None
The public purpose, which the State had in mind has been spelt out in its affidavit as under In finalising the lease terms and conditions and the proposal of the respondent No. 5, the fact that setting up of the said industry in the low lying land at Mourigram would not only provide employment to more than 300 persons (which estimate was provided even by Shedden Meating Group, Australia in its feasibility study report carried out in the year 1983 as aforesaid) and indirect employment to large number of persons in West Bengal were taken into consideration.	None
It was also taken into consideration that setting up an industry in such a semirural area in Mourigram, a Gram Panchayat area under Duillya Gram Panchayat of Zilla Parishad Howrah would help in industrialisation of the said area and consequently the State of West Bengal.	None
The fact that the proposed unit would be an export oriented which would earn valuable foreign exchange of more than Rs. 50 crores under export obligation in terms of the EPGC Scheme of the Government of India whereunder machinery and equipment for setting up the Project would be imported, as represented by the respondent No. 5 during the course of negotiation, was also taken into account.	None
Learned Counsel for the appellant has not referred to any statutory provision mandating the State to adhere to a specified procedure in the matter of transfer of its property either by way of sale or by lease.	None
In the absence of a statutory restriction imposed upon the State, it is to be seen whether the impugned action is against public interest or actuated by extraneous considerations or is opposed to fair play or the State is shown to have conferred undue benefits upon undeserving party.	None
It has been consistently held by this Court that in a democracy governed by the rule of law, the Executive Government or any of its officers cannot be allowed to possess arbitrary powers over the interests of the individual.	None
Every action of the Executive Government must be in conformity with reason and should be free from arbitrariness.	None
The Government cannot be equated with an individual in the matter of selection of the recipient for its largese.	None
Dealing with the limits on the exercise of Executive authority in relation to rule of administrative justice, Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Vitarell v. Seaton, (1959) 359 US 535 3 L Ed 2nd 1012 said An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged Accordingly, if dismissal from employment is based on a defined procedure, even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency, that procedure must be scrupulously observed.	None
This judicially evolved rule of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I may add, rightly so.	None
He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with the sword.	None
This Rule of Administrative law, was accepted as valid and applicable in India by this Court in A.S. Ahluwalia v. The State of Punjab and others, 1975(3)	None
SCR 82, Sukhdev Singh and others v. Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and another, 1975(3)	None
SCR 619 and Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport Authority of India and others, AIR 1979 SC 1628 .	None
Though the State cannot escape its liability to show its actions to be fair, reasonable and in accordance with law, yet wherever challenge is thrown to any of such action, initial burden of showing the prima facie existence of violation of the mandate of the Constitution lies upon the person approaching the Court.	None
We have found in this case, that the appellants have miserably failed to place on record or to point out to any alleged constitutional vice or illegality.	None
Neither the High Court nor this Court would have ventured to make a rowing inquiry particularly in a writ petition filed at the instance of the erstwhile owners of the land, whose main object appeared to get the land back by any means so, admittedly, with the passage of time and development of the area, the value of the land had appreciated manifold.	None
It may be noticed that in the year 1961 the erstwhile owners were paid about Rs. 5.5 lakhs and the State Government assessed the market value of the property which was paid by respondent No. 5 at Rs. 71,59,820/.	None
The appellants have themselves stated that the value of the land round about the time, when it was leased to respondent No. 5 was about Rs. 11 crores.	None
There cannot be any dispute with the proposition that generally when any State land is intended to be transferred or the State largese decided to be conferred, resort should be had to public auction or transfer by way of inviting tenders from the people.	None
That would be a sure method of guaranteeing the compliance of mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution.	None
Nonfloating of tenders or not holding of public auction would not in all cases be deemed to be the result of the exercise of the executive power in an arbitrary manner.	None
Making an exception to the general rule could be justified by the State executive, if challenged in appropriated proceedings.	None
The Constitutional Courts cannot be expected to presume the alleged irregularities, illegalities or unconstitutionality nor the courts can substitute their opinion for the bona fide opinion of the State executive.	None
The courts are not concerned with the ultimate decision but only with the fairness of the decision making process.	None
The Government is entitled to make pragmatic adjustments and policy decision which may be necessary or called for under the prevalent peculiar circumstances.	None
The court cannot strike down a policy decision taken by the Government merely because it feels that another decision would have been fairer or wiser or more scientific for logical.	None
In State of M.P. and others v. Nandlal Jaiswal and others, 1986(4) SCC 566	None
it was held that the policy decision can be interfered with by the court only if such decision is shown to be patently arbitrary, discriminatory or mala fide.	None
In the matter of different modes, under the rule of general application made under the M.P. Excise Act, the Court found that the four different modes, namely, tender, auction, fixed licence fee or such other manner were alternative to one another and any one of them could be resorted to.	None
In Sachidanand Pandey and another v. State of West Bengal and others, 1987(2) SCC 295, it was held that as regards the question of propriety of private negotiation with an individual or corporation, it should be borne in mind that State owned or public owned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive.	None
Certain precepts and principles have to be observed, public interest being the paramount consideration.	None
One of the methods of securing the public interest when it is considered necessary to dispose of the property is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders.	None
But such a rule is not an invariable rule.	None
There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule.	None
As and when a departure is made from the general rule, it must be shown that such an action was rational and not suggestive of discrimination.	None
In that case on facts the Court found that on the commercial and financial aspect, the lease granted in favour of a group of hoteliers, not arbitrary as the method of net sales was held to be fairly wellknown method adopted in similar situations.	None
To the same effect is the judgment in G.D. Zalani and another v. Union of India and others, 1995 Supp.(2) SCC 512.	None
In Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. The State of Jammu and Kashmir and another, AIR 1980 SC 1992 , this Court, after referring to various judgments, including the judgment in Ramana Dayaram Shettys case, held  It is imperative in a democracy governed by the rule of law that governmental action must be kept within the limits of law and if there is any transgression, the Court must be ready to condemn it.	None
It is a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency in every government to assume more and more powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in some countries that the legislative check is getting diluted, it is left to the Court as the only other reviewing authority under the Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure observation with the rule of law and in this task, the court must not flinch or falter.	None
It may be pointed out that this ground of invalidity, namely, that the governmental action is unreasonable or lacking in the quality of public interest, is different from that of mala fides though it may, in a given case, furnish evidence of mala fides.	None
In M.P. Oil Extraction and another v. State of M.P. and others, 1997(7)	None
SCC 592 this Court held  Although to ensure fair play and transparency in State action, distribution of largesse by inviting open tenders or by public auction is desirable, it cannot be held that in no case distribution of such largese by negotiation is permissible.	None
In the instant case, as a policy decision protection measure by entering into agreements with selected industrial units for assured supply of sal trees at concessional rate has been taken by the Government.	None
The rate of royalty has also been fixed on some accepted principle of pricing formula as will be indicated hereafter.	None
Hence, distribution or allotment of sal seeds at the determined royalty to the respondents and other units covered by the agreements cannot be assailed.	None
It is to be appreciated that in case, distribution by public auction or by open tender may not achieve the purpose of the policy of protection measure by way of supply of sal seeds at concessional rate of royalty to the industrial units covered by the agreements on being selected on valid and objective considerations.	None
It was further held that principle of reasonableness and nonarbitrariness in governmental action is the core of our entire Constitutional scheme and structure.	None
On the facts of that case, the action of the State Government in granting a contract by way of negotiation was held not arbitrary or irrational.	None
In the backdrop of the legal position noticed herein, it has to be seen, in the instant case, as to whether the action of the respondent No. 1 was illegal, arbitrary or mala fide.	None
To justify their action of entering into an agreement of lease by negotiation, even in the absence of pleadings on behalf of the appellants, the State has submitted that the entire transaction of granting the lease to the respondent No. 5 for an integrated food processing unit with an abattoir in a semirural area, which was a low lying land, despite their best efforts, the State Government were unable to set up any project.	None
The lease was given to respondent No. 5 upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances with the object of setting up an industry in the State of West Bengal which was likely to generate employment to more than 300 persons and earn foreign exchange worth more than Rs. 50 crores.	None
The negotiations were resorted to ensure the disposal of the slaughter house at Durgapur which was proved to have been running in losses.	None
The respondentState had failed to get any buyer for Durgapur Project despite Newspaper advertisements.	None
The Government had decided to make a package deal for the purposes of transferring the Durgapur Project and establishment of Mourigram Project.	None
Earlier a memorandum of understanding had been arrived at between Government of India and Australia which ultimately did not mature in the shape of an abattoir.	None
Due to financial constraints, continuous loss suffered at Durgapur and lack of technical expertise, the respondentState could not venture to undertake the Mourigram Project for setting up of an abattoir.	None
Having failed in all its efforts, the then Ministerincharge of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department of the Government of West Bengal is stated to have written to some Bombay based firms, reputed in the field, to salvage the two projects.	None
Positive response is stated to have been received from some firms including Genagro Foods (India) Ltd.	None
namely, respondent No. 5 and M s. I. Ahmed and Company.	None
The proposal of I. Ahmed and Company being very vague was not accepted.	None
Respondent No. 5 had shown interest in taking over both Durgaplur and Mourigram sites under certain terms and conditions for the purpose of revitalising and making operational the existing abattoir at Durgapur and for setting up of Integrated Food Processing Unit along with abattoir at Mourigram.	None
It is further stated in the counteraffidavit of the respondentState, that  Since, no response was received from the advertisements and the personal requests made in the manner above by the Ministerincharge of the Department from any concern except as aforesaid, the State took into account the credentials of the group of companies of which Genagro Foods (India) Ltd. was one, including the export award certificate awarded to M s.

None

The Agricultur and Processed Foods Export Development Authority (APEDA), Ministry of Commerce, Govt. of India, had acknowledged and certified the efforts of respondent No. 5 and its associated companies in the export of Meat and other agro products such as rice, tea, coffee, spices, onion, cashew, pulses extractions, marine products and processed food and vegetable.	None
In view of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case we are not persuaded to hold that the action of the respondentState in executing the lease deed with respondent No. 5 was unreasonable, illegal, arbitrary or actuated by extraneous considerations.	Reasoning
In this regard it is worth noticing that none except the erstwhile owners and the propounders of vegetarianism have made any grievance to the effect that the market value of the property, as charged from respondent No. 5, was either allegedly for a song or at a throw away price.26.	Reasoning
The inaction of the appellants in approaching the Court, almost after three years of the impugned lease deed is an additional circumstance to doubt their bona fides in challenging the impugned action.	Reasoning
During the pendency of the litigation between the parties, a huge project has actually, by now, come into existence where the production has also commenced.	Reasoning
Respondent No. 5 is claimed to have spent a sum of Rs. 73.01 crores as of 30.10.1999 on the project.	Reasoning
Interference at this stage will not only adversely affected the business of respondent No. 5 but would also render a large number of people unemployed and deprive the State its cherished desire of developing the industrial growth.	Reasoning
Under the circumstances, we do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned judgments or the action of the respondentState in granting the lease to respondent No. 5.	Decision
The appeal is accordingly dismissed but without any order as to costs.	None
Appeal dismissed.	None
