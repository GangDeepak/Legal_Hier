 P. JEEVAN REDDY J. These appeals are preferred by Marshall Sons and Company (India) Limited (hereinafter referred to as the holding company) as successors to Marshall Sons and Company (Manufacturing) Limited (hereinafter referred to as the subsidiary company) against the judgment and order of the Madras High Court dismissing the writ petitions filed by them.	Facts
The matter arises under the Incometax Act.	Facts
The holding company had its registered office at 33A, Chowringhee Road, Calcutta, while the subsidiary company had its registered office at Madras.	Facts
For the purposes of assessment under the Incometax Act, while the accounting year of the holding company was the year ending on 30th June, the accounting year of the subsidiary company was the calendar year.	Facts
On December 1, 1982, two letters were addressed by the subsidiary company to the Incometax Officer stating that the company is desirous of effecting a change in the accounting year.	Facts
They stated that they would wish to close their accounts on June 30, 1983, for the eighteen months period (January 1, 1982, to June 30, 1983) instead of closing the accounts on December 31, 1982.	Facts
It was also stated that since the accounting year of the holding company ends on June 30, they too would like to follow the same practice.	Facts
In response to the said letters, the Incometax Officer asked for certain particulars which were supplied.	Facts
On February 3, 1983, the Incometax Officer permitted the subsidiary company to change the accounting year from December 31, 1982, to June 30, 1983, subject to the conditions mentioned therein, viz.	None
As a consequence of the change, the income of the period of 18 months from January 1, 1982 to June 30, 1983, will be assessed for the assessment year 198485.	None
Any relief that may be withdrawn in the future legislation with effect from the assessment year 198485 will be made applicable to the entire income for the assessment year 198485 and depreciation will be allowed proportionately as per rules.	None
The assessment year 198384 which is slipped on account of the change of the previous year will, however, be treated as one assessment year for the purposes of set off of carried forward losses, relief under section 80J of the Incometax Act, 1961, if any.	Facts
In December, 1982, the subsidiary company passed a resolution proposing to amalgamate with the holding company with effect from January 1, 1982.	None
An application was made to the company court and pursuant to the orders of the court, a meeting of the shareholders was held on February 11, 1983, whereat a resolution was passed approving the amalgamation of the subsidiary company with the holding company.	Facts
A similar resolution was passed by the shareholders of the holding company on May 7, 1983.	Facts
The company court (Madras High Court) sanctioned the scheme of amalgamation by its order dated November 21, 1983, in C. P. No. 23 of 1983.	Facts
On a similar application filed before the Calcutta High Court, C. P. No. 294 of 1983, that High Court (company court) too sanctioned the scheme of amalgamation by its order dated January 11, 1984.	Facts
In both the orders, it was directed that certified copies of the said orders shall be delivered to the Registrars of Companies at Madras and Calcutta within thirty days therefrom.	Facts
Accordingly, certified copies of the orders were filed before the Registrars of Companies on January 20, 1984, at Madras and on February 24, 1984, at Calcutta.	Facts
The name of the subsidiary company was struck off the Register of Companies, maintained by the Registrar of Companies at Madras, on January 21, 1986.	None
On November 25, 1984, a notice under section 139(2) of the Incometax Act was issued to the subsidiary company calling upon it to file a return of its income for the assessment year 198485 (for the year ending June 30, 1983) and for 198586 (year ending June 30, 1984).	None
The subsidiary company replied stating that inasmuch as the subsidiary company has been amalgamated with the holding company under a scheme of amalgamation sanctioned by the company courts of Madras and Calcutta and because the said amalgamation was with effect from January 1, 1982, there was no question of the subsidiary company filing a return for the said two assessment years.	Facts
There was exchange of notices replies thereafter, which it is not necessary to mention at this stage.	Facts
Ultimately, the Incometax Officer issued a notice under section 142(1) asking for compliance with it by February 7, 1986.	Facts
At that stage, the appellantcompany filed writ petitions in the Madras High Court questioning the aforesaid notices.	Facts
In the writ petitions filed by the appellant, the main ground urged was that inasmuch as the amalgamation has taken effect on and from January 1, 1982, the Incometax Officer had no authority to call upon the subsidiary company to file a return for any period subsequent thereto.	Facts
It was submitted that the scheme of amalgamation has been sanctioned by the company courts at Madras and Calcutta and that, therefore, any business which may have been carried on by the subsidiary company subsequent to January 1, 1982, was as an agent of the holding company and not on its own account.	Facts
It was submitted that the subsidiary company had no income of its ownindeed no existence of its own in law on or after January 1, 1982.	Facts
In the counteraffidavit filed by the Incometax Officer, he submitted that the amalgamation became effective only when it was sanctioned by the court and after certified copies of the orders of the courts were filed with the Registrars of Companies.	Facts
His case was that only when the name of the subsidiary company was struck off the register by the Registrar of Companies, Madras, the subsidiary company can be said to have ceased to exist.	Facts
The respondent also stated that, as a matter of fact, the relevant clauses in the scheme of amalgamation themselves indicate that the scheme was to take effect only when sanctioned by the court and only when the shares of the holding company are allotted to members of the subsidiary company.	Facts
He submitted that this allotment of shares took place only in June, 1984.	Facts
The Incometax Officer further submitted in his counteraffidavit that the said amalgamation was a device adopted to evade the tax legitimately due from the subsidiary company.	Facts
He submitted that while the holding company was incurring losses, the subsidiary company was making substantial profits and that the scheme of amalgamation was merely a device to avoid paying taxes on the income earned by the subsidiary company.	Facts
The idea behind the amalgamation, according to him, was to set off the accumulated losses of the holding company against the profits of the subsidiary company.	Facts
He also raised objection with respect to the maintainability of the writ petition on the ground, inter alia, that the Incometax Act provides adequate remedies to agitate all the contentions urged in the said writ petition.	None
The High Court dismissed the writ petition with the following findings (1) The date of amalgamation (January 1, 1982) specified in the scheme of amalgamation is totally artificial and arbitrary.	None
Till the beginning of December, 1982, the amalgamation was not even in the contemplation of either company.	Facts
Only in December, 1982, was the resolution of the directors passed proposing amalgamation.	Facts
The shareholders meeting took place some time in February, 1983.	Facts
The scheme itself contemplates that it is subject to and conditional upon the scheme being sanctioned by the court under section 391 of the Act and appropriate orders being made for implementation of the said scheme under section 394.	Facts
The scheme also provides that its implementation is conditional upon the shareholders holding not less than 9/10ths in value of the shares in the subsidiary company becoming shareholders of the transfereecompany.	Facts
In this view of the matter, specifying the date of amalgamation as January 1, 1982, has no relevance or meaning.	Facts
The amalgamation becomes effective only when the court approves the scheme of amalgamation and not at any earlier point of time.	Facts
In other words, the operative dates would be January 20, 1984, and February 24, 1984, on which dates the Madras and Calcutta High Courts approved the scheme.	Facts
There is nothing in the orders of the courts to show that the said orders were to be effective from January 1, 1982.(2) From the counteraffidavit, it appears that the subsidiary company was borne on the Register of Companies up to January 21, 1986.	Facts
This shows that the company was in existence till that date and that it did not cease to exist, as a fact, on January 1, 1982.(3)	Facts
In view of the aforesaid findings, it is not necessary to go into or express any opinion on the plea of the Incometax Officer that the said amalgamation was merely a device to evade the payment of taxes legitimately due on the income of the subsidiary company.	Facts
For the same reason, no opinion need be expressed on the objection of the Incometax Officer with respect to the maintainability of the writ petition.	Facts
Sri N. K. Poddar, learned counsel for the appellant, urged a number of grounds in support of his attack upon the validity of the judgment under appeal.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the view taken by the Madras High Court in United India Life Assurance Co. Ltd. v. CIT 1963 (33) CC 849, which has been followed in the judgment under appeal does not represent the correct view of law.	Arguments of Petitioner
He submitted that the contrary view taken by the Bombay High Court in CIT v. Swastik Rubber Products Ltd. 1983 (53) CC 174 (and followed in later decisions of that court) represents the correct view.	Arguments of Petitioner
In other words, the contention is that inasmuch as both the Madras and Calcutta High Courts (company courts) had approved the scheme of amalgamation as it stood, it means that the scheme of amalgamation is effective from January 1, 1982.	Arguments of Petitioner
No doubt, the scheme states that it is conditional upon being sanctioned by the court but that only means that whenever it is sanctioned by the court, the scheme as approved takes effect.	Arguments of Petitioner
The scheme specifically states that the scheme of amalgamation is effective from January 1, 1982.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel submitted that according to the well accepted practice prevailing in this country, all schemes of amalgamation specify a particular date of amalgamation and unless the court specifies otherwise, the date provided in the scheme of amalgamation is taken as the actual date of amalgamation.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel submitted that subsequent to January 1, 1982, the subsidiary company may have carried on business awaiting the orders of the court, but it could not do otherwise and that the business so carried on by it was as an agent of and for and on behalf of the holding company and not on its own account.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel also submitted that no balancesheet was drawn up for any period subsequent to January 1, 1982, for the subsidiary company.	Arguments of Petitioner
No annual general body meeting of shareholders was held of the subsidiary company after the said date and that, to all intents and purposes, the subsidiary company ceased to exist as an independent entity on and from January 1, 1982.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel relied upon the language of sections 391 and 394 and on certain decisions in support of his contention.	Arguments of Petitioner
Sri Poddar raised an alternate contention too, viz.	Arguments of Petitioner
, if for any reason, it is held that the amalgamation is not effective with effect from January 1, 1982, it must be held to be effective from February 11, 1983/May 7, 1983 (the date on which the shareholders meetings were held).	Arguments of Petitioner
Both these dates are prior to June 30, 1983the last day of the accounting year (as sanctioned by the Incometax Officer) since the income of the company can be said to accrue only at the end of the year when the accounts are made upand not from day to dayit must be held that no income accrued to the subsidiary company at the end of the said accounting year (January 1, 1982, to June 30, 1983) the income accrued only on June 30, 1983, and it accrued only to the holding company.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the other hand, Dr. R. R. Mishra, learned counsel for the revenue, supported the reasoning and conclusion of the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel further submitted that the scheme of amalgamation was a mere device to evade the payment of taxes lawfully due according to law and that this is a good ground on which the incometax authorities can ignore the alleged amalgamation, even if for any reason it can be held that it is effective from January 1, 1982.	Arguments of Respondent
Counsel also submitted that the writ petition filed by the appellant ought to have been dismissed summarily on the ground that it was premature and that the appellant should have been directed to pursue the remedies provided by the Incometax Act according to law.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court, he submits, ought not to have entered into the merits of several contentions raised by the appellant, all of which can be more satisfactorily gone into after the assessments are made wherein all the relevant facts could have been gathered.	Arguments of Respondent
Let us first examine the position obtaining in this behalf under the Companies Act.	None

The form in which several notices contemplated by sections 391 and 394 and rules 67 to 87 are to be issued are prescribed in Forms Nos. 33 to 42 appended to the Companies (Court) Rules.	None

The order sanctioning the scheme is required to be drawn up in accordance with Forms Nos. 41 and 42 of the Companies (Court) Rules.	None
We may now refer to the scheme of amalgamation as passed at the meetings of the shareholders of both the holding and the subsidiary companies.	None
Transferor company is defined to mean the subsidiary company and the expression transferee company is defined to mean the holding company.	None
The expression this scheme is defined to mean this scheme in the present form or with any modifications approved or imposed by the High Court of Judicature at Tamil Nadu and or by the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta.	None
The expression the transfer date is defined to mean January 1, 1982 and the expression the operative date means the date on which the certified copies of the orders of the High Courts of Tamil Nadu and Calcutta under section 391(2)/394(2) of the Act shall have been filed with the Registrars of Companies in Tamil Nadu and Calcutta, respectively.	None
The expression terminal date is defined to mean the date immediately preceding the operative date.	None
The scheme refers to the capital structure of the transferor and the transferee companies, the object of the scheme underlying the agreement between the parties and then states The undertaking of the transferor company shall, with effect from and including the transfer date and without further act or deed, be transferred to the transferee company pursuant to sections 391(2) and 394(2) of the Act and vest in the transferee company with all the estate and interest of the transferor company but subject, nevertheless, to all charges affecting the same and on the said date, the transferor company shall be amalgamated with the transferee company.6.	None
(a) The excess of the value of the net assets of the transferor company, based on the balancesheet of the transferor company as at the date immediately preceding the transfer date over its subscribed and paid up capital shall, to the extent of the amount appearing as development rebate reserve, investment allowance reserve and investment allowance reserve (utilised) in such balancesheet of the transferor company, be the development rebate reserve, investment allowance reserve and investment allowance reserve (utilised) of the transferee company (b)	None
The transferor company shall, with effect from the transfer date, be deemed to have carried on its business for and on behalf of the transferee company, and accordingly the profits and losses of the transferor company for the period commencing from the transfer date shall be deemed to be the profits or losses of the transferee company and shall be available to the transferee company for disposal in any manner including the declaration of any dividend by the transferee company after the operative date, subject to the provisions of the Act.7.	None
The implementation of this scheme is conditional upon this scheme being sanctioned under section 391 of the Act and the appropriate orders for implementation of this scheme being made under section 394 of the Act by the High Courts of Tamil Nadu and Calcutta.8.	Reasoning
The implementation of this scheme is conditional also upon the shareholders holding not less than ninetenths in value of the shares in the transferor company (other than shares already held therein immediately before the amalgamation by the transferee company) becoming shareholders of the transferee company by virtue of the amalgamation.	Facts
A reading of the above clauses of the scheme shows that according to the scheme, the entire undertaking of the subsidiary company shall be transferred to the holding company with effect from the transfer date and that the subsidiary company shall be amalgamated with the holding company with effect from the said date.	Reasoning
Clause 6 states clearly that the implementation of the said scheme is conditional upon the scheme being sanctioned under section 391 of the Act and the appropriate orders for the implementation of this scheme being made under section 394 of the Act by the High Courts of Tamil Nadu and Calcutta.	Reasoning
Clause 8 further provides that the implementation of the said scheme is conditional also upon the shareholders holding not less than ninetenths in value of the shares in the subsidiary company becoming shareholders of the holding company by virtue of the amalgamation.	Reasoning
It is on the basis of the language of clauses 7 and 8 that the High Court has opined that the scheme takes effect only on and from the date it was sanctioned by the High Courts of Madras and Calcutta coupled with the date on which the shareholders of the subsidiary company become the shareholders of the holding company as provided in the subclauses.	Reasoning
The High Court has opined that the transfer date mentioned in the scheme, viz., January 1, 1982, is totally artificial and arbitrary (for the reason that on the said date neither the company nor their shareholders had even thought of amalgamation) and that it has no legal significance.	Reasoning
According to the High Court, therefore, the date on which the amalgamation should be deemed to have come into being is not January 1, 1982, but January 20, 1984/February 24, 1984, on which dates the Madras and Calcutta High Courts, respectively, approved the scheme.	Reasoning
In other words, the High Court has taken the view that in the absence of any date being specified in the order of the High Court as the date of amalgamation, the date of the order of the High Court (company courts) shall be taken as the date of amalgamation.	Reasoning
For arriving at the said view, the High Court followed an earlier Full Bench decision of that court in Sahayanidhi (Virudhunagar) Ltd. v. A. R. S. Subrahmanya Nadar 1950 (20) CC 214.	None
The High Court also opined that the decision of the Bombay High Court in Swastik Rubber Products Ltd.s case 1983 (53) CC 174 is of no assistance to the appellant.	None
On this basis the High Court has upheld the validity of the notices issued by the Incometax Officer, which notices were impugned in the writ petition, and dismissed the writ petition.	None
The question is whether the view taken by the High Court is correct.	None
Every scheme of amalgamation has to necessarily provide a date with effect from which the amalgamation transfer shall take place.	None
The scheme concerned herein does so provide, viz., January 1, 1982.	Reasoning
It is true that while sanctioning the scheme, it is open to the court to modify the said date and prescribe such date of amalgamation transfer as it thinks appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case.	Reasoning
If the court so specifies a date, there is little doubt that such date would be the date of amalgamation date of transfer.	Reasoning
But where the court does not prescribe any specific date but merely sanctions the scheme presented to itas has happened in this caseit should follow that the date of amalgamation date of transfer is the date specified in the scheme as the transfer date.	Reasoning
It cannot be otherwise.	Reasoning
It must be remembered that before applying to the court under section 391(1), a scheme has to be framed and such scheme has to contain a date of amalgamation transfer.	Reasoning
The proceedings before the court may take some time indeed, they are bound to take some time because several steps provided by sections 391 to 394A and the relevant rules have to be followed and complied with.	Reasoning
During the period the proceedings are pending before the court, both the amalgamating units, i.e., the transferor company and the transferee company may carry on business, as has happened in this case, but normally provision is made for this aspect also in the scheme of amalgamation.	Reasoning
In the scheme before us, clause 6(b) does expressly provide that with effect from the transfer date, the transferor company (subsidiary company) shall be deemed to have carried on the business for and on behalf of the transferee company (holding company) with all attendant consequences.	Reasoning
It is equally relevant to notice that the courts have not only sanctioned the scheme in this case, but have also not specified any other date as the date of transfer amalgamation.	Reasoning
In such a situation, it would not be reasonable to say that the scheme of amalgamation takes effect on and from the date of the order sanctioning the scheme.	Reasoning
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the notices issued by the Incometax Officer (impugned in the writ petition) were not warranted in law.	Reasoning
The business carried on by the transferor company (subsidiary company) should be deemed to have been carried on for and on behalf of the transferee company.	Reasoning
This is the necessary and the logical consequence of the court sanctioning the scheme of amalgamation as presented to it.	Reasoning
The order of the court sanctioning the scheme, the filing of the certified copies of the orders of the court before the Registrar of Companies, the allotment of shares, etc., may have all taken place subsequent to the date of amalgamation transfer, yet the date of amalgamation in the circumstances of this case would be January 1, 1982.	Reasoning
This is also the ratio of the decision of the Privy Council in Raghubar Dayal v. Bank of Upper India Ltd., 1919 AIR(PC) 9.	None
Counsel for the Revenue contended that if the aforesaid view is adopted then several complications will ensue in case the court refuses to sanction the scheme of amalgamation.	None
We do not see any basis for this apprehension.	None
Firstly, an assessment can always be made and is supposed to be made on the transferee company taking into account the income of both the transferor and transferee companies.	Reasoning
Secondly, and probably the more advisable course from the point of view of the Revenue would be to make one assessment on the transferee company taking into account the income of both the transferor or transferee companies and also to make separate protective assessments on both the transferor and transferee companies separately.	Reasoning
There may be a certain practical difficulty in adopting this course inasmuch as separate balancesheets may not be available for the transferor and transferee companies.	Reasoning
But that may not be an insuperable problem, inasmuch as assessment can always be made, on the available material, even without a balancesheet.	Reasoning
In certain cases, best judgment assessment may also be resorted to.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, we need not pursue this line of enquiry because it does not arise for consideration in these cases directly.	None
In the light of the view taken by us on the principal question, it is not necessary to consider the alternate submission urged by Shri Poddar.	None
For the above reasons, the appeals are accordingly allowed.	Decision
The writ petitions filed by the appellant in the High Court shall be deemed to have been allowed.	Decision
We, however, make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion on the plea of learned counsel for the Revenue that the amalgamation itself is a device designed to evade the taxes legitimately payable by the subsidiary company.	Decision
If the incometax authorities think that they are entitled to raise this question in the proceedings under the Incometax Act, it is open to them to do so by way of a separate proceeding according to law.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
