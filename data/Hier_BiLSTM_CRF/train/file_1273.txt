That, Bharti is also an Indian company in the same field as HEL.	Facts
Bharti was a direct competitor of HEL in India.	Facts
According to Essar, the effect of the transaction between HTIL and VIH would be that Vodafone with an indirect controlling interest in HEL and in Bharti violated Press Note 1, particularly, absent consent from Essar.	Facts
However, vide letter dated 14.03.2007, Essar gave its consent to the sale.	Facts
Accordingly, its objection stood withdrawn.	Facts

Facts
By letter of the same date from HEL to FIPB, it was pointed out that HTIL was a company listed on NY SE.	Facts
Accordingly, it had to file Statements in accordance with US SEC.	Facts
That, under US GAAP, HTIL had to consolidate the assets and liabilities of companies even though not majority owned or controlled by HTIL, because of a US accounting standard that required HTIL to consolidate an entity whereby HTIL had risk or reward.	Facts
Therefore, this accounting consolidation required that even though HTIL held no shares nor management rights still they had to be computed in the computation of the holding in terms of the Listing Norms.	Facts
It is the said accounting consolidation which led to the reporting of additional 19.54 in HEL, which leads to combined holding of 61.88.	Facts
On the other hand, under Indian GAAP, the interest as of March, 2006 was 42.34 7.28 (rounded up to 49.62).	Facts
After the additional purchase of 2.34 from Hindujas in August 2006, the aggregate HTIL direct and indirect FDI stood at 51.96.	Facts
In short, due to the difference in the US GAAP and the Indian GAAP the Declarations varied.	Facts
The combined holding for US GAAP purposes was 61.88 whereas for Indian GAAP purposes it was 51.96.	Facts
Thus, according to HEL, the Indian GAAP number reflected the true equity ownership and control position.	Facts
By letter dated 9.03.2007, addressed by FIPB to HEL, several queries were raised.	Facts
One of the questions FIPB had asked was as to which entity was entitled to appoint the directors to the Board of Directors of HEL on behalf of TIIL which owns 19.54 of HEL?	Facts

However, in practice the directors of HEL have been appointed pro rata to their respective shareholdings which resulted in 4 directors being appointed from the Essar Group, 6 directors from HTIL Group and 2 directors from TII.	Facts
In practice, the directors appointed by TII to the Board of HEL were AS and AG.	Facts
One more clarification was sought by FIPB from HEL on the credit support received by AG for his investment in HEL.	Facts
In answer to the said query, HEL submitted that the credit support for AG Group in respect of 4.68 stake in HEL through the Asim Ghosh investment entities, was a standby letter of credit issued by Rabobank Hong Kong in favour of Rabo India Finance Pvt. Ltd. which in turn has made a Rupee loan facility available to Centrino, one of the companies in AG Group.	Facts
By letter dated 14.03.2007 addressed by VIH to FIPB, it stood confirmed that VIHs effective shareholding in HEL would be 51.96.	Facts

These investments combined would give VIH a controlling interest of 52 in HEL.	Facts
In addition, HTILs existing Indian partners AG, AS and IDFC (i.e. SMMS), who between them held a 15 interest in HEL (i.e. option route), agreed to retain their shareholdings with full control, including voting rights and dividend rights.	Facts

Correctness of Azadi Bachao case  Re Tax voidance Evasion Before us, it was contended on behalf of the Revenue that Union of India v. Azadi Bachao Andolan (2004) 10 SCC 1 needs to be overruled insofar as it departs from McDowell and Co. Ltd. v. CTO (1985) 3 SCC 230 principle for the following i)	None
Para 46 of McDowell judgment has been missed which reads as under on this aspect Chinnappa Reddy, J. has proposed a separate opinion with which we agree.	Arguments of Petitioner
i.e. Westminster principle is dead.	Arguments of Petitioner
ii) That, Azadi Bachao failed to read paras 4145 and 46 of McDowell in entirety.	Arguments of Petitioner
If so read, the only conclusion one could draw is that four learned judges speaking through Misra, J. agreed with the observations of Chinnappa Reddy, J. as to how in certain circumstances tax avoidance should be brought within the tax net.	Arguments of Petitioner
iii)	Arguments of Petitioner
That, subsequent to McDowell, another matter came before the Constitution Bench of five Judges in Mathuram Agrawal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1999) 8 SCC 667, in which Westminster principle was quoted which has not been noticed by Azadi Bachao.	Arguments of Petitioner
Our Analysis Before coming to IndoMauritius DTAA, we need to clear the doubts raised on behalf of the Revenue regarding the correctness of Azadi Bachao (supra) for the simple reason that certain tests laid down in the judgments of the English Courts subsequent to The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. His Grace the Duke of Westminster 1935 All E.R. 259 and W.T. Ramsay Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners (1981) 1	Reasoning
All E.R. 865 help us to understand the scope of IndoMauritius DTAA.	Reasoning
It needs to be clarified, that, McDowell dealt with two aspects.	Reasoning
First, regarding validity of the Circular(s) issued by CBDT concerning IndoMauritius DTAA.	Reasoning
Second, on concept of tax avoidance evasion.	Reasoning
Before us, arguments were advanced on behalf of the Revenue only regarding the second aspect.	Reasoning
The Westminster principle states that, given that a document or transaction is genuine, the court cannot go behind it to some supposed underlying substance.	None
The said principle has been reiterated in subsequent English Courts Judgments as the cardinal principle.	None
Ramsay was a case of salelease back transaction in which gain was sought to be counteracted, so as to avoid tax, by establishing an allowable loss.	Reasoning
The method chosen was to buy from a company a readymade scheme, whose object was to create a neutral situation.	Reasoning
The decreasing asset was to be sold so as to create an artificial loss and the increasing asset was to yield a gain which would be exempt from tax.	Reasoning
The Crown challenged the whole scheme saying that it was an artificial scheme and, therefore, fiscally ineffective.	Reasoning
It was held that Westminster did not compel the court to look at a document or a transaction, isolated from the context to which it properly belonged.	Reasoning
It is the task of the Court to ascertain the legal nature of the transaction and while doing so it has to look at the entire transaction as a whole and not to adopt a dissecting approach.	Reasoning
In the present case, the Revenue has adopted a dissecting approach at the Department level.	Reasoning
Ramsay did not discard Westminster but read it in the proper context by which device which was colourable in nature had to be ignored as fiscal nullity.	Reasoning
Thus, Ramsay lays down the principle of statutory interpretation rather than an overarching antiavoidance doctrine imposed upon tax laws.	Reasoning
Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson (1984) 1	None
All E.R. 530 dealt with the case of interpositioning of a company to evade tax.	None
On facts, it was held that the inserted step had no business purpose, except deferment of tax although it had a business effect.	None
Dawson went beyond Ramsay.	None
It reconstructed the transaction not on some fancied principle that anything done to defer the tax be ignored but on the premise that the inserted transaction did not constitute disposal under the relevant Finance Act.	None
Thus, Dawson is an extension of Ramsay principle.	None
After Dawson, which empowered the Revenue to restructure the transaction in certain circumstances, the Revenue started rejecting every case of strategic investment tax planning undertaken years before the event saying that the insertion of the entity was effected with the sole intention of tax avoidance.	None
In Craven (Inspector of Taxes) v. White (Stephen) (1988) 3 All.	None
E.R. 495 it was held that the Revenue cannot start with the question as to whether the transaction was a tax deferment saving device but that the Revenue should apply the look at test to ascertain its true legal nature.	None
It observed that genuine strategic planning had not been abandoned.	None
The majority judgment in McDowell held that tax planning may be legitimate provided it is within the framework of law (para 45).	None
In the latter part of para 45, it held that colourable device cannot be a part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage the belief that it is honourable to avoid payment of tax by resorting to dubious methods.	None
It is the obligation of every citizen to pay the taxes without resorting to subterfuges.	None
The above observations should be read with para 46 where the majority holds on this aspect one of us, Chinnappa Reddy, J. has proposed a separate opinion with which we agree.	None
The words this aspect express the majoritys agreement with the judgment of Reddy, J. only in relation to tax evasion through the use of colourable devices and by resorting to dubious methods and subterfuges.	None
Thus, it cannot be said that all tax planning is illegal illegitimate impermissible.	None
Moreover, Reddy, J. himself says that he agrees with the majority.	None
In the judgment of Reddy, J. there are repeated references to schemes and devices in contradistinction to legitimate avoidance of tax liability (paras 710, 17 18).	None
In our view, although Chinnappa Reddy, J. makes a number of observations regarding the need to depart from the Westminster and tax avoidance  these are clearly only in the context of artificial and colourable devices.	None
Reading McDowell, in the manner indicated hereinabove, in cases of treaty shopping and or tax avoidance, there is no conflict between McDowell and Azadi Bachao or between McDowell and Mathuram Agrawal.	None
International Tax Aspects of Holding Structures.	None
In the thirteenth century, Pope Innocent IV espoused the theory of the legal fiction by saying that corporate bodies could not be excommunicated because they only exist in abstract.	None
This enunciation is the foundation of the separate entity principle.	None
The approach of both the corporate and tax laws, particularly in the matter of corporate taxation, generally is founded on the abovementioned separate entity principle, i.e., treat a company as a separate person.	None
The Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, in the matter of corporate taxation, is founded on the principle of the independence of companies and other entities subject to incometax.	None
Companies and other entities are viewed as economic entities with legal independence visavis their shareholders participants.	None
It is fairly well accepted that a subsidiary and its parent are totally distinct tax payers.	None
Consequently, the entities subject to incometax are taxed on profits derived by them on standalone basis, irrespective of their actual degree of economic independence and regardless of whether profits are reserved or distributed to the shareholders participants.	None
Furthermore, shareholders participants, that are subject to (personal or corporate) incometax, are generally taxed on profits derived in consideration of their shareholding participations, such as capital gains.	None
Now a days, it is fairly well settled that for tax treaty purposes a subsidiary and its parent are also totally separate and distinct tax payers.	None
It is generally accepted that the group parent company is involved in giving principal guidance to group companies by providing general policy guidelines to group subsidiaries.	None
However, the fact that a parent company exercises shareholders influence on its subsidiaries does not generally imply that the subsidiaries are to be deemed residents of the State in which the parent company resides.	None
Further, if a company is a parent company, that companys executive director(s) should lead the group and the companys shareholders influence will generally be employed to that end.	None
This obviously implies a restriction on the autonomy of the subsidiarys executive directors.	None
Such a restriction, which is the inevitable consequences of any group structure, is generally accepted, both in corporate and tax laws.	None
However, where the subsidiarys executive directors competences are transferred to other persons bodies or where the subsidiarys executive directors decision making has become fully subordinate to the Holding Company with the consequence that the subsidiarys executive directors are no more than puppets then the turning point in respect of the subsidiarys place of residence comes about.	None
Similarly, if an actual controlling NonResident Enterprise (NRE) makes an indirect transfer through abuse of organisation form legal form and without reasonable business purpose which results in tax avoidance or avoidance of withholding tax, then the Revenue may disregard the form of the arrangement or the impugned action through use of NonResident Holding Company, recharacterize the equity transfer according to its economic substance and impose the tax on the actual controlling NonResident Enterprise.	None
Thus, whether a transaction is used principally as a colourable device for the distribution of earnings, profits and gains, is determined by a review of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction.	None
It is in the above cases that the principle of lifting the corporate veil or the doctrine of substance over form or the concept of beneficial ownership or the concept of alter ego arises.	None
There are many circumstances, apart from the one given above, where separate existence of different companies, that are part of the same group, will be totally or partly ignored as a device or a conduit (in the pejorative sense).	None
The common law jurisdictions do invariably impose taxation against a corporation based on the legal principle that the corporation is a person that is separate from its members.	None
It is the decision of the House of Lords in Salomon v. Salomon (1897)	None
A.C. 22 that opened the door to the formation of a corporate group.	None
If a one man corporation could be incorporated, then it would follow that one corporation could be a subsidiary of another.	None
This legal principle is the basis of Holding Structures.	None
It is a common practice in international law, which is the basis of international taxation, for foreign investors to invest in Indian companies through an interposed foreign holding or operating company, such as Cayman Islands or Mauritius based company for both tax and business purposes.	None
In doing so, foreign investors are able to avoid the lengthy approval and registration processes required for a direct transfer (i.e., without a foreign holding or operating company) of an equity interest in a foreign invested Indian company.	None
However, taxation of such Holding Structures very often gives rise to issues such as double taxation, tax deferrals and tax avoidance.	None
In this case, we are concerned with the concept of GAAR.	None
In this case, we are not concerned with treatyshopping but with the antiavoidance rules.	None
The concept of GAAR is not new to India since India already has a judicial antiavoidance rule, like some other jurisdictions.	None
Lack of clarity and absence of appropriate provisions in the statute and or in the treaty regarding the circumstances in which judicial antiavoidance rules would apply has generated litigation in India.	None
Holding Structures are recognized in corporate as well as tax laws.	None
Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and Holding Companies have a place in legal structures in India, be it in company law, takeover code under SEBI or even under the income tax law.	None
When it comes to taxation of a Holding Structure, at the threshold, the burden is on the Revenue to allege and establish abuse, in the sense of tax avoidance in the creation and or use of such structure(s).	None
In the application of a judicial antiavoidance rule, the Revenue may invoke the substance over form principle or piercing the corporate veil test only after it is able to establish on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction that the impugned transaction is a sham or tax avoidant.	None
To give an example, if a structure is used for circular trading or round tripping or to pay bribes then such transactions, though having a legal form, should be discarded by applying the test of fiscal nullity.	None
Similarly, in a case where the Revenue finds that in a Holding Structure an entity which has no commercial business substance has been interposed only to avoid tax then in such cases applying the test of fiscal nullity it would be open to the Revenue to discard such interpositioning of that entity.	None
However, this has to be done at the threshold.	None
In this connection, we may reiterate the look at principle enunciated in Ramsay (supra) in which it was held that the Revenue or the Court must look at a document or a transaction in a context to which it properly belongs to.	None
It is the task of the Revenue Court to ascertain the legal nature of the transaction and while doing so it has to look at the entire transaction as a whole and not to adopt a dissecting approach.	Reasoning
The Revenue cannot start with the question as to whether the impugned transaction is a tax deferment saving device but that it should apply the look at test to ascertain its true legal nature See Craven v. White (supra) which further observed that genuine strategic tax planning has not been abandoned by any decision of the English Courts till date.	None
Applying the above tests, we are of the view that every strategic foreign direct investment coming to India, as an investment destination, should be seen in a holistic manner.	None
While doing so, the Revenue Courts should keep in mind the following factors the concept of participation in investment, the duration of time during which the Holding Structure exists the period of business operations in India the generation of taxable revenues in India the timing of the exit the continuity of business on such exit.	None
In short, the onus will be on the Revenue to identify the scheme and its dominant purpose.	None
The corporate business purpose of a transaction is evidence of the fact that the impugned transaction is not undertaken as a colourable or artificial device.	None
The stronger the evidence of a device, the stronger the corporate business purpose must exist to overcome the evidence of a device.	None
Whether Section 9 is a look through provision as submitted on behalf of the Revenue?	None
According to the Revenue, if its primary argument (namely, that HTIL has, under the SPA, directly extinguished its property rights in HEL and its subsidiaries) fails, even then in any event, income from the sale of CGP share would nonetheless fall within Section 9 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as that Section provides for a look through.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, it was submitted that the word through in Section 9 inter alia means in consequence of.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was, therefore, argued that if transfer of a capital asset situate in India happens in consequence of something which has taken place overseas (including transfer of a capital asset), then all income derived even indirectly from such transfer, even though abroad, becomes taxable in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, even if control over HEL were to get transferred in consequence of transfer of the CGP Share outside India, it would yet be covered by Section 9.	Arguments of Petitioner
We find no merit in the above submission of the Revenue.	Reasoning
At the outset, we quote hereinbelow the following Sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961 Scope of total income.	None
5. (2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the total income of any previous year of a person who is a nonresident includes all income from whatever source derived which  (a) is received or is deemed to be received in India in such year by or on behalf of such person or (b) accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during such year.	None
Income deemed to accrue or arise in India.	None
9. (1) The following incomes shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India  all income accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, through or from any business connection in India, or through or from any property in India, or through or from any asset or source of income in India, or through the transfer of a capital asset situate in India.	Reasoning
Section 9(1)(i) gathers in one place various types of income and directs that income falling under each of the subclauses shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India.	Reasoning
Broadly there are four items of income.	Reasoning
The income dealt with in each subclause is distinct and independent of the other and the requirements to bring income within each subclause, are separately noted.	Reasoning
Hence, it is not necessary that income falling in one category under any one of the subclauses should also satisfy the requirements of the other subclauses to bring it within the expression income deemed to accrue or arise in India in Section 9(1)(i).	Reasoning
In this case, we are concerned with the last subclause of Section 9(1)(i) which refers to income arising from transfer of a capital asset situate in India.	Reasoning
Thus, charge on capital gains arises on transfer of a capital asset situate in India during the previous year.	Reasoning
The said subclause consists of three elements, namely, transfer, existence of a capital asset, and situation of such asset in India.	Reasoning
All three elements should exist in order to make the last subclause applicable.	Reasoning
Therefore, if such a transfer does not exist in the previous year no charge is attracted.	Reasoning
Further, Section 45 enacts that such income shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year in which transfer took place.	Reasoning
Consequently, there is no room for doubt that such transfer should exist during the previous year in order to attract the said subclause.	Reasoning
The fiction created by Section 9(1)(i) applies to the assessment of income of nonresidents.	Reasoning
In the case of a resident, it is immaterial whether the place of accrual of income is within India or outside India, since, in either event, he is liable to be charged to tax on such income.	Reasoning
But, in the case of a nonresident, unless the place of accrual of income is within India, he cannot be subjected to tax.	Reasoning
In other words, if any income accrues or arises to a nonresident, directly or indirectly, outside India is fictionally deemed to accrue or arise in India if such income accrues or arises as a sequel to the transfer of a capital asset situate in India.	Reasoning
Once the factum of such transfer is established by the Department, then the income of the nonresident arising or accruing from such transfer is made liable to be taxed by reason of Section 5(2)(b) of the Act.	Reasoning
This fiction comes into play only when the income is not charged to tax on the basis of receipt in India, as receipt of income in India by itself attracts tax whether the recipient is a resident or nonresident.	Reasoning
This fiction is brought in by the legislature to avoid any possible argument on the part of the nonresident vendor that profit accrued or arose outside India by reason of the contract to sell having been executed outside India.	Reasoning
Thus, income accruing or arising to a nonresident outside India on transfer of a capital asset situate in India is fictionally deemed to accrue or arise in India, which income is made liable to be taxed by reason of Section 5(2)(b) of the Act.	Reasoning
This is the main purpose behind enactment of Section 9(1)(i) of the Act.	Reasoning
We have to give effect to the language of the section when it is unambiguous and admits of no doubt regarding its interpretation, particularly when a legal fiction is embedded in that section.	Reasoning
A legal fiction has a limited scope.	Reasoning
A legal fiction cannot be expanded by giving purposive interpretation particularly if the result of such interpretation is to transform the concept of chargeability which is also there in Section 9(1)(i), particularly when one reads Section 9(1)(i) with Section 5(2)(b) of the Act.	Reasoning
What is contended on behalf of the Revenue is that under Section 9(1)(i) it can look through the transfer of shares of a foreign company holding shares in an Indian company and treat the transfer of shares of the foreign company as equivalent to the transfer of the shares of the Indian company on the premise that Section 9(1)(i) covers direct and indirect transfers of capital assets.	Reasoning
For the above reasons, Section 9(1)(i) cannot by a process of interpretation be extended to cover indirect transfers of capital assets property situate in India.	Reasoning
To do so, would amount to changing the content and ambit of Section 9(1)(i).	Reasoning
We cannot rewrite Section 9(1)(i).	Reasoning
The legislature has not used the words indirect transfer in Section 9(1)(i).	Reasoning
If the word indirect is read into Section 9(1)(i), it would render the express statutory requirement of the 4th subclause in Section 9(1)(i) nugatory.	Reasoning
This is because Section 9(1)(i) applies to transfers of a capital asset situate in India.	Reasoning
This is one of the elements in the 4th subclause of Section 9(1)(i) and if indirect transfer of a capital asset is read into Section 9(1)(i) then the words capital asset situate in India would be rendered nugatory.	Reasoning
Similarly, the words underlying asset do not find place in Section 9(1)(i).	Reasoning
Further, transfer should be of an asset in respect of which it is possible to compute a capital gain in accordance with the provisions of the Act.	Reasoning
Moreover, even Section 163(1)(c) is wide enough to cover the income whether received directly or indirectly.	Reasoning
Thus, the words directly or indirectly in Section 9(1)(i) go with the income and not with the transfer of a capital asset (property).	Reasoning
Lastly, it may be mentioned that the Direct Tax Code (DTC) Bill, 2010 proposes to tax income from transfer of shares of a foreign company by a nonresident, where at any time during 12 months preceding the transfer, the fair market value of the assets in India, owned directly or indirectly, by the company, represents at least 50 of the fair market value of all assets owned by the company.	Reasoning
Thus, the DTC Bill, 2010 proposes taxation of offshore share transactions.	Reasoning
This proposal indicates in a way that indirect transfers are not covered by the existing Section 9(1)(i) of the Act.	Reasoning
In fact, the DTC Bill, 2009 expressly stated that income accruing even from indirect transfer of a capital asset situate in India would be deemed to accrue in India.	Reasoning
These proposals, therefore, show that in the existing Section 9(1)(i) the word indirect cannot be read on the basis of purposive construction.	Reasoning
The question of providing look through in the statute or in the treaty is a matter of policy.	Reasoning
It is to be expressly provided for in the statute or in the treaty.	Reasoning
Similarly, limitation of benefits has to be expressly provided for in the treaty.	Reasoning
Such clauses cannot be read into the Section by interpretation.	Reasoning
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Section 9(1)(i) is not a look through provision.	Reasoning
Transfer of HTILs property rights by Extinguishment?	None
The primary argument advanced on behalf of the Revenue was that the SPA, commercially construed, evidences a transfer of HTILs property rights by their extinguishment.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, HTIL had, under the SPA, directly extinguished its rights of control and management, which are property rights, over HEL and its subsidiaries and, consequent upon such extinguishment, there was a transfer of capital asset situated in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support, the following features of the SPA were highlighted (i) the right of HTIL to direct a downstream subsidiary as to the manner in which it should vote.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, this right was a property right and not a contractual right.	Arguments of Petitioner
It vested in HTIL as HTIL was a parent company, i.e., a 100 shareholder of the subsidiary (ii)	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, the 2006 Shareholders Framework Agreements had to be continued upon transfer of control of HEL to VIH so that VIH could step into the shoes of HTIL.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, such continuance was ensured by payment of money to AS and AG by VIH failing which AS and AG could have walked out of those agreements which would have jeopardized VIHs control over 15 of the shares of HEL and, consequently, the stake of HTIL in TII would have stood reduced to minority (iii) Termination of IDFC Framework Agreement of 2006 and its substitution by a fresh Framework Agreement dated 5.06.2007, as warranted by SPA (iv) Termination of Term Sheet Agreement dated 5.07.2003.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, that Term Sheet Agreement was given effect to by clause 5.2 of the SPA which gave Essar the right to Tag Along with HTIL and exit from HEL.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, by a specific Settlement Agreement dated 15.03.2007 between HTIL and Essar, the said Term Sheet Agreement dated 5.07.2003 stood terminated.	Arguments of Petitioner
This, according to the Revenue, was necessary because the Term Sheet bound the parties (v) the SPA ignores legal entities interposed between HTIL and HEL enabling HTIL to directly nominate the Directors on the Board of HEL (vi) Qua management rights, even if the legal owners of HELs shares (Mauritius entities) could have been directed to vote by HTIL in a particular manner or to nominate a person as a Director, such rights existed dehors the CGP share (vii) Vide clause 6.2 of the SPA, HTIL was required to exercise voting rights in the specified situations on the diktat of VIH ignoring the legal owner of CGP share HTIHL (BVI).	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus, according to the Revenue, HTIL ignored its subsidiaries and was exercising the voting rights qua the CGP and the HEL shares directly, ignoring all the intermediate subsidiaries which are 100 held and which are nonoperational.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, extinguishment took place dehors the CGP share.	Arguments of Petitioner
It took place by virtue of various clauses of SPA as HTIL itself disregarded the corporate structure it had set up (viii) As a holder of 100 shares of downstream subsidiaries, HTIL possessed de facto control over such subsidiaries.	Arguments of Petitioner
Such de facto control was the subject matter of the SPA.	Arguments of Petitioner
At the outset, we need to reiterate that in this case we are concerned with the sale of shares and not with the sale of assets, itemwise.	Reasoning
The facts of this case show sale of the entire investment made by HTIL, through a Top company, viz.	Reasoning
CGP, in the Hutchison Structure.	Reasoning
In this case we need to apply the look at test.	Reasoning
In the impugned judgment, the High Court has rightly observed that the arguments advanced on behalf of the Department vacillated.	Reasoning
The reason for such vacillation was adoption of dissecting approach by the Department in the course of its arguments.	Reasoning
Ramsay (supra) enunciated the look at test.	Reasoning
According to that test, the task of the Revenue is to ascertain the legal nature of the transaction and, while doing so, it has to look at the entire transaction holistically and not to adopt a dissecting approach.	Reasoning
One more aspect needs to be reiterated.	Reasoning
There is a conceptual difference between preordained transaction which is created for tax avoidance purposes, on the one hand, and a transaction which evidences investment to participate in India.	Reasoning
In order to find out whether a given transaction evidences a preordained transaction in the sense indicated above or investment to participate, one has to take into account the factors enumerated hereinabove, namely, duration of time during which the holding structure existed, the period of business operations in India, generation of taxable revenue in India during the period of business operations in India, the timing of the exit, the continuity of business on such exit, etc.	Reasoning
Applying these tests to the facts of the present case, we find that the Hutchison structure has been in place since 1994.	Reasoning
It operated during the period 1994 to 11.02.2007.	Reasoning
It has paid income tax ranging from 3 crore to 250 crore per annum during the period 200203 to 200607.	Reasoning
Even after 11.02.2007, taxes are being paid by VIH ranging from 394 crore to 962 crore per annum during the period 200708 to 201011 (these figures are apart from indirect taxes which also run in crores).	Reasoning
Moreover, the SPA indicates continuity of the telecom business on the exit of its predecessor, namely, HTIL.	Reasoning
Thus, it cannot be said that the structure was created or used as a sham or tax avoidant.	Reasoning
It cannot be said that HTIL or VIH was a fly by night operator short time investor.	Reasoning
If one applies the look at test discussed hereinabove, without invoking the dissecting approach, then, in our view, extinguishment took place because of the transfer of the CGP share and not by virtue of various clauses of SPA.	Reasoning
In a case like the present one, where the structure has existed for a considerable length of time generating taxable revenues right from 1994 and where the court is satisfied that the transaction satisfies all the parameters of participation in investment then in such a case the court need not go into the questions such as de facto control vs. legal control, legal rights vs. practical rights, etc. Be that as it may, did HTIL possess a legal right to appoint directors onto the board of HEL and as such had some property right in HEL?	Reasoning
If not, the question of such a right getting extinguished will not arise.	Reasoning
A legal right is an enforceable right.	Reasoning
Enforceable by a legal process.	Reasoning
The question is what is the nature of the control that a parent company has over its subsidiary.	Reasoning
It is not suggested that a parent company never has control over the subsidiary.	Reasoning
For example, in a proper case of lifting of corporate veil, it would be proper to say that the parent company and the subsidiary form one entity.	Reasoning
But barring such cases, the legal position of any company incorporated abroad is that its powers, functions and responsibilities are governed by the law of its incorporation.	Reasoning
No multinational company can operate in a foreign jurisdiction save by operating independently as a good local citizen.	Reasoning
A company is a separate legal persona and the fact that all its shares are owned by one person or by the parent company has nothing to do with its separate legal existence.	Reasoning
If the owned company is wound up, the liquidator, and not its parent company, would get hold of the assets of the subsidiary.	Reasoning
In none of the authorities have the assets of the subsidiary been held to be those of the parent unless it is acting as an agent.	Reasoning
Thus, even though a subsidiary may normally comply with the request of a parent company it is not just a puppet of the parent company.	Reasoning
The difference is between having power or having a persuasive position.	Reasoning
Though it may be advantageous for parent and subsidiary companies to work as a group, each subsidiary will look to see whether there are separate commercial interests which should be guarded.	Reasoning
When there is a parent company with subsidiaries, is it or is it not the law that the parent company has the power over the subsidiary.	Reasoning
It depends on the facts of each case.	Reasoning
For instance, take the case of a oneman company, where only one man is the shareholder perhaps holding 99 of the shares, his wife holding 1.	Reasoning
In those circumstances, his control over the company may be so complete that it is his alter ego.	Reasoning
But, in case of multinationals it is important to realise that their subsidiaries have a great deal of autonomy in the country concerned except where subsidiaries are created or used as a sham.	Reasoning
Of course, in many cases the courts do lift up a corner of the veil but that does not mean that they alter the legal position between the companies.	Reasoning
The directors of the subsidiary under their Articles are the managers of the companies.	Reasoning
If new directors are appointed even at the request of the parent company and even if such directors were removable by the parent company, such directors of the subsidiary will owe their duty to their companies (subsidiaries).	Reasoning
They are not to be dictated by the parent company if it is not in the interests of those companies (subsidiaries).	Reasoning
The fact that the parent company exercises shareholders influence on its subsidiaries cannot obliterate the decisionmaking power or authority of its (subsidiarys) directors.	Reasoning
They cannot be reduced to be puppets.	Reasoning
The decisive criteria is whether the parent companys management has such steering interference with the subsidiarys core activities that subsidiary can no longer be regarded to perform those activities on the authority of its own executive directors.	None
Before dealing with the submissions advanced on behalf of the Revenue, we need to appreciate the reason for execution of the SPA.	None
Exit is an important right of an investor in every strategic investment.	None
The present case concerns transfer of investment in entirety.	None
As stated above, exit coupled with continuity of business is one of the important telltale circumstance which indicates the commercial business substance of the transaction.	Reasoning
Thus, the need for SPA arose to readjust the outstanding loans between the companies to provide for standstill arrangements in the interregnum between the date of signing of the SPA on 11.02.2007 and its completion on 8.05.2007 to provide for a seamless transfer and to provide for fundamental terms of price, indemnities, warranties etc.	Reasoning
As regards the right of HTIL to direct a downstream subsidiary as to the manner in which it should vote is concerned, the legal position is well settled, namely, that even though a subsidiary may normally comply with the request of a parent company, it is not just a puppet of the parent company.	Reasoning
The difference is between having the power and having a persuasive position.	Reasoning
A great deal depends on the facts of each case.	Reasoning
Further, as stated above, a company is a separate legal persona, and the fact that all the shares are owned by one person or a company has nothing to do with the existence of a separate company.	Reasoning
Therefore, though it may be advantageous for a parent and subsidiary companies to work as a group, each subsidiary has to protect its own separate commercial interests.	Reasoning
In our view, on the facts and circumstances of this case, the right of HTIL, if at all it is a right, to direct a downstream subsidiary as to the manner in which it should vote would fall in the category of a persuasive position influence rather than having a power over the subsidiary.	Reasoning
In this connection the following facts are relevant.	Reasoning
Under the Hutchison structure, the business was carried on by the Indian companies under the control of their Board of Directors, though HTIL, as the Group holding company of a set of companies, which controlled 42 plus 10 (pro rata) shares, did influence or was in a position to persuade the working of such Board of Directors of the Indian companies.	Reasoning
In this connection, we need to have a relook at the ownership structure.	Reasoning
It is not in dispute that 15 out of 67 stakes in HEL was held by AS, AG and IDFC companies.	Reasoning
That was one of the main reasons for entering into separate Shareholders and Framework Agreements in 2006, when Hutchison structure existed, with AS, AG and IDFC.	Reasoning
HTIL was not a party to the agreements with AS and AG, though it was a party to the agreement with IDFC.	Reasoning
That, the ownership structure of Hutchison clearly shows that AS, AG and SMMS (IDFC) group of companies, being Indian companies, possessed 15 control in HEL.	Reasoning
Similarly, the term sheet with Essar dated 5.07.2003 gave Essar the RoFR and Right to Tag	Reasoning
Along with HTIL and exit from HEL.	Reasoning
Thus, if one keeps in mind the Hutchison structure in its entirety, HTIL as a Group holding company could have only persuaded its downstream companies to vote in a given manner as HTIL had no power nor authority under the said structure to direct any of its downstream companies to vote in a manner as directed by it (HTIL).	Reasoning
Facts of this case show that both the parent and the subsidiary companies worked as a group since 1994.	Reasoning
That, as a practice, the subsidiaries did comply with the arrangement suggested by the Group holding company in the matter of voting, failing which the smooth working of HEL generating huge revenues was not possible.	Reasoning
In this case, we are concerned with the expression capital asset in the income tax law.	Reasoning
Applying the test of enforceability, influence persuasion cannot be construed as a right in the legal sense.	Reasoning
One more aspect needs to be highlighted.	Reasoning
The concept of de facto control, which existed in the Hutchison structure, conveys a state of being in control without any legal right to such state.	Reasoning
This aspect is important while construing the words capital asset under the income tax law.	Reasoning
As stated earlier, enforceability is an important aspect of a legal right.	Reasoning
Applying these tests, on the facts of this case and that too in the light of the ownership structure of Hutchison, we hold that HTIL, as a Group holding company, had no legal right to direct its downstream companies in the matter of voting, nomination of directors and management rights.	Reasoning
As regards continuance of the 2006 Shareholders Framework Agreements by SPA is concerned, one needs to keep in mind two relevant concepts, viz., participative and protective rights.	Reasoning
As stated, this is a case of HTIL exercising its exit right under the holding structure and continuance of the telecom business operations in India by VIH by acquisition of shares.	Reasoning
In the Hutchison structure, exit was also provided for Essar, Centrino, NDC and SMMS through exercise of Put Option TARs, subject to sectoral cap being relaxed in future.	Reasoning
These exit rights in Essar, Centrino, NDC and SMMS (IDFC) indicate that these companies were independent companies.	Reasoning
Essar was a partner in HEL whereas Centrino, NDC and SMMS controlled 15 of shares of HEL (minority).	Reasoning
A minority investor has what is called as a participative right, which is a subset of protective rights.	Reasoning
These participative rights, given to a minority shareholder, enable the minority to overcome the presumption of consolidation of operations or assets by the controlling shareholder.	Reasoning
These participative rights in certain instances restrict the powers of the shareholder with majority voting interest to control the operations or assets of the investee.	Reasoning
At the same time, even the minority is entitled to exit.	Reasoning
This exit right comes under protective rights.	Reasoning
On examination of the Hutchison structure in its entirety, we find that both, participative and protective rights, were provided for in the Shareholders Framework Agreements of 2006 in favour of Centrino, NDC and SMMS which enabled them to participate, directly or indirectly, in the operations of HEL.	Reasoning
Even without the execution of SPA, such rights existed in the above agreements.	Reasoning
Therefore, it would not be correct to say that such rights flowed from the SPA.	Reasoning
One more aspect needs to be mentioned.	Reasoning
The Framework Agreements define change of control with respect to a shareholder inter alia as substitution of limited or unlimited liability company, whether directly or indirectly, to direct the policies management of the respective shareholders, viz., Centrino, NDC, Omega.	Reasoning
Thus, even without the SPA, upon substitution of VIH in place of HTIL, on acquisition of CGP share, transition could have taken place.	Reasoning
It is important to note that transition is a wide concept.	Reasoning
It is impossible for the acquirer to visualize all events that may take place between the date of execution of the SPA and completion of acquisition.	Reasoning
Therefore, we have a provision for standstill in the SPA and so also the provision for transition.	Reasoning
But, from that, it does not follow that without SPA, transition could not ensue.	Reasoning
Therefore, in the SPA, we find provisions concerning Vendors Obligations in relation to the conduct of business of HEL between the date of execution of SPA and the closing date, protection of investment during the said period, agreement not to amend, terminate, vary or waive any rights under the Framework Shareholders Agreements during the said period, provisions regarding running of business during the said period, assignment of loans, consequence of imposition of prohibition by way of injunction from any court, payment to be made by VIH to HTIL, giving of warranties by the Vendor, use of Hutch Brand, etc.	Reasoning
The next point raised by the Revenue concerns termination of IDFC Framework Agreement of 2006 and its substitution by a fresh Framework Agreement dated 5.06.2007 in terms of the SPA.	Reasoning
The submission of the Revenue before us was that the said Agreement dated 5.06.2007 (which is executed after the completion of acquisition by VIH on 8.05.2007) was necessary to assign the benefits of the earlier agreements of 2006 to VIH.	Reasoning
This is not correct.	Reasoning
The shareholders of ITNL (renamed as Omega) were Array through HTIL Mauritius and SMMS (an Indian company).	Reasoning
The original investors through SMMS (IDFC), an infrastructure holding company, held 54.21 of the share capital of Omega that, under the 2006 Framework Agreement, the original investors were given Put Option by GSPL an Indian company under Hutchison Teleservices (India) Holdings Limited (Ms) requiring GSPL to buy the equity share capital of SMMS that on completion of acquisition on 8.05.2007 there was a change in control of HTIL Mauritius which held 45.79 in Omega and that changes also took place on 5.06.2007 within the group of original investors with the exit of IDFC and SSKI.	Reasoning
In view of the said changes in the parties, a revised Framework Agreement was executed on 6.06.2007, which again had call and put option.	Reasoning
Under the said Agreement dated 6.06.2007, the Investors once again agreed to grant call option to GSPL to buy the shares of SMMS and to enter into a Shareholders Agreement to regulate the affairs of Omega.	Reasoning
It is important to note that even in the fresh agreement the call option remained with GSPL and that the said Agreement did not confer any rights on VIH.	Reasoning
One more aspect needs to be mentioned.	Reasoning
The conferment of call options on GSPL under the Framework Agreements of 2006 also had a linkage with intragroup loans.	Reasoning
CGP was an Investment vehicle.	Reasoning
It is through the acquisition of CGP that VIH had indirectly acquired the rights and obligations of GSPL in the Centrino and NDC Framework Agreements of 2006 see the report of KPMG dated 18.10.2010 and not through execution of the SPA.	Reasoning
Lastly, as stated above, apart from providing for standstill, an SPA has to provide for transition and all possible future eventualities.	Reasoning
In the present case, the change in the investors, after completion of acquisition on 8.05.2007, under which SSKI and IDFC exited leaving behind IDF alone was a situation which was required to be addressed by execution of a fresh Framework Agreement under which the call option remained with GSPL.	Reasoning
Therefore, the June, 2007 Agreements relied upon by the Revenue merely reiterated the rights of GSPL which rights existed even in the Hutchison structure as it stood in 2006.	Reasoning
It was next contended that the 2003 Term Sheet with Essar was given effect to by clause 5.2 of the SPA which gave Essar the Right to Tag Along with HTIL and exit from HEL.	Reasoning
That, the Term Sheet of 5.07.2003 had legal effect because by a specific settlement dated 15.03.2007 between HTIL and Essar, the said Term Sheet stood terminated which was necessary because the Term Sheet bound the parties in the first place.	Reasoning
We find no merit in the above arguments of the Revenue.	Reasoning
The 2003 Term Sheet was between HTIL, Essar and UMTL.	Reasoning
Disputes arose between Essar and HTIL.	Reasoning
Essar asserted RoFR rights when bids were received by HTIL, which dispute ultimately came to be settled on 15.03.2007, that is after the SPA dated 11.02.2007.	Reasoning
The SPA did not create any rights.	Reasoning
The RoFR TARs existed in the Hutchison structure.	Reasoning
Thus, even without SPA, within the Hutchison structure these rights existed.	Reasoning
Moreover, the very object of the SPA is to cover the situations which may arise during the transition and those which are capable of being anticipated and dealt with.	Reasoning
Essar had 33 stakes in HEL.	Reasoning
As stated, the Hutchison structure required the parent and the subsidiary to work together as a group.	Reasoning
The said structure required the Indian partners to be kept in the loop.	Reasoning
Disputes on existence of RoFR TARs had to be settled.	Reasoning
They were settled on 15.03.2007.	Reasoning
The rights and obligations created under the SPA had to be preserved.	Reasoning
In any event, preservation of such rights with a view to continue business in India is not extinguishment.	Reasoning
For the above reasons, we hold that under the HTIL structure, as it existed in 1994, HTIL occupied only a persuasive position influence over the downstream companies qua manner of voting, nomination of directors and management rights.	Reasoning
That, the minority shareholders investors had participative and protective rights (including RoFR TARs, call and put options which provided for exit) which flowed from the CGP share.	Reasoning
That, the entire investment was sold to the VIH through the investment vehicle (CGP).	Reasoning
Consequently, there was no extinguishment of rights as alleged by the Revenue.	None
Role of CGP in the transaction The main contention of the Revenue was that CGP stood inserted at a late stage in the transaction in order to bring in a taxfree entity (or to create a transaction to avoid tax) and thereby avoid capital gains.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, in December, 2006, HTIL explored the possibility of the sale of shares of the Mauritius entities and found that such transaction would be taxable as HTIL under that proposal had to be the prime mover behind any agreement with VIH  prime mover in the sense of being both a seller of shares and the recipient of the sale proceeds therefrom.	Arguments of Petitioner
Consequently, HTIL moved upwards in the Hutchison structure and devised an artificial tax avoidance scheme of selling the CGP share when in fact what HTIL wanted was to sell its property rights in HEL.	Arguments of Petitioner
This, according to the Revenue, was the reason for the CGP share being interposed in the transaction.	Arguments of Petitioner
We find no merit in these arguments.	Reasoning
When a business gets big enough, it does two things.	None
First, it reconfigures itself into a corporate group by dividing itself into a multitude of commonly owned subsidiaries.	None
Second, it causes various entities in the said group to guarantee each others debts.	None
A typical large business corporation consists of subincorporates.	None
Such division is legal.	None
It is recognized by company law, laws of taxation, takeover codes etc.	None
On top is a parent or a holding company.	None
The parent is the public face of the business.	None
The parent is the only group member that normally discloses financial results.	None
Below the parent company are the subsidiaries which hold operational assets of the business and which often have their own subordinate entities that can extend layers.	None
If large firms are not divided into subsidiaries, creditors would have to monitor the enterprise in its entirety.	None
Subsidiaries reduce the amount of information that creditors need to gather.	None
Subsidiaries also promote the benefits of specialization.	None
Subsidiaries permit creditors to lend against only specified divisions of the firm.	None
These are the efficiencies inbuilt in a holding structure.	None
Subsidiaries are often created for tax or regulatory reasons.	None
They at times come into existence from mergers and acquisitions.	None
As group members, subsidiaries work together to make the same or complementary goods and services and hence they are subject to the same market supply and demand conditions.	None
They are financially interlinked.	None
One such linkage is the intragroup loans and guarantees.	None
Parent entities own equity stakes in their subsidiaries.	None
Consequently, on many occasions, the parent suffers a loss whenever the rest of the group experiences a downturn.	None
Such grouping is based on the principle of internal correlation.	None
Courts have evolved doctrines like piercing the corporate veil, substance over form etc. enabling taxation of underlying assets in cases of fraud, sham, tax avoidant, etc.	None
However, genuine strategic tax planning is not ruled out.	None
CGP was incorporated in 1998 in Cayman Islands.	None
It was in the Hutchison structure from 1998.	None
The transaction in the present case was of divestment and, therefore, the transaction of sale was structured at an appropriate tier, so that the buyer really acquired the same degree of control as was hitherto exercised by HTIL.	Reasoning
VIH agreed to acquire companies and the companies it acquired controlled 67 interest in HEL.	Reasoning
CGP was an investment vehicle.	Reasoning
As stated above, it is through the acquisition of CGP that VIH proposed to indirectly acquire the rights and obligations of GSPL in the Centrino and NDC Framework Agreements.	Reasoning
The report of Ernst Young dated 11.02.2007 inter alia states that when they were asked to conduct due diligence by VIH, it was in relation to Array and its subsidiaries.	Reasoning
The said report evidences that at the negotiation stage, parties had in mind the transfer of an upstream company rather than the transfer of HEL directly.	Reasoning
The transfer of Array had the advantage of transferring control over the entire shareholding held by downstream Mauritius companies (tier I companies), other than GSPL.	Reasoning
On the other hand, the advantage of transferring the CGP share enabled VIH to indirectly acquire the rights and obligations of GSPL (Indian company) in the Centrino and NDC Framework agreements.	Reasoning
This was the reason for VIH to go by the CGP route.	Reasoning
One of the arguments of the Revenue before us was that the Mauritius route was not available to HTIL for the reason indicated above.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, it was urged that the legal owner of HEL (Indian company) was not HTIL.	Arguments of Petitioner
Under the transaction, HTIL alone was the seller of the shares.	Reasoning
VIH wanted to enter into an agreement only with HTIL so that if something goes wrong, VIH could look solely to HTIL being the group holding company (parent company).	Reasoning
Further, funds were pumped into HEL by HTIL.	Reasoning
These funds were to be received back in the shape of a capital gain which could then be used to declare a special dividend to the shareholders of HTIL.	Reasoning
We find no merit in this argument.	Reasoning
Firstly, the tier I (Mauritius companies) were the indirect subsidiaries of HTIL who could have influenced the former to sell the shares of Indian companies in which event the gains would have arisen to the Mauritius companies, who are not liable to pay capital gains tax under the IndoMauritius DTAA.	Reasoning
That, nothing prevented the Mauritius companies from declaring dividend on gains made on the sale of shares.	Reasoning
There is no tax on dividends in Mauritius.	Reasoning
Thus, the Mauritius route was available but it was not opted for because that route would not have brought in the control over GSPL.	Reasoning
Secondly, if the Mauritius companies had sold the shares of HEL, then the Mauritius companies would have continued to be the subsidiaries of HTIL, their accounts would have been consolidated in the hands of HTIL and HTIL would have accounted for the gains in exactly the same way as it has accounted for the gains in the hands of HTIHL (CI) which was the nominated payee.	Reasoning
Thus, in our view, two routes were available, namely, the CGP route and the Mauritius route.	Reasoning
It was open to the parties to opt for any one of the two routes.	Reasoning
Thirdly, as stated above, in the present case, the SPA was entered into inter alia for a smooth transition of business on divestment by HTIL.	Reasoning
As stated, transfer of the CGP share enabled VIH to indirectly acquire the rights and obligations of GSPL in the Centrino and NDC Framework Agreements.	Reasoning
Apart from the said rights and obligations under the Framework Agreements, GSPL also had a call centre business.	Reasoning
VIH intended to take over from HTIL the telecom business.	Reasoning
It had no intention to acquire the business of call centre.	Reasoning
Moreover, the FDI norms applicable to the telecom business in India were different and distinct from the FDI norms applicable to the call centre business.	Reasoning
Consequently, in order to avoid legal and regulatory objections from Government of India, the call centre business stood hived off.	Reasoning
In our view, this step was an integral part of transition of business under SPA.	Reasoning
On the role of CGP in the transaction, two documents are required to be referred to.	Reasoning
One is the Report of the KPMG dated 18.10.2010 in which it is stated that through the acquisition of CGP, VIH had indirectly acquired the rights and obligations of GSPL in the Centrino and NDC Framework Agreements.	Reasoning
That, the said two agreements were put in place with a view to provide AG and AS with downside protection while preserving upside value in the growth of HEL.	Reasoning
The second document is the Annual Report 2007 of HTIL.	Reasoning
Under the caption Overview, the Report observes that on 11.02.2007, HTIL entered into an agreement to sell its entire interests in CGP, a company which held through various subsidiaries, the direct and indirect equity and loan interests in HEL (renamed VEL) and its subsidiaries to VIH for a cash consideration of HK 86.6 bn.	Reasoning
As a result of the said Transaction, the net debt of the Group which stood at HK 37,369 mn as on 31.12.2006 became a net cash balance of HK 25,591 mn as on 31.12.2007.	Reasoning
This supports the fact that the sole purpose of CGP was not only to hold shares in subsidiary companies but also to enable a smooth transition of business, which is the basis of the SPA.	Reasoning
Therefore, it cannot be said that the intervened entity (CGP) had no business or commercial purpose.	Reasoning
Before concluding, one more aspect needs to be addressed.	Arguments of Petitioner
It concerns situs of the CGP share.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, under the Companies Law of Cayman Islands, an exempted company was not entitled to conduct business in the Cayman Islands.	Arguments of Petitioner
CGP was an exempted company.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, since CGP was a mere holding company and since it could not conduct business in Cayman Islands, the situs of the CGP share existed where the underlying assets are situated, that is to say, India.	Arguments of Petitioner
That, since CGP as an exempted company conducts no business either in the Cayman Islands or elsewhere and since its sole purpose is to hold shares in a subsidiary company situated outside the Cayman Islands, the situs of the CGP share, in the present case, existed where the underlying assets stood situated (India).	Arguments of Petitioner
We find no merit in these arguments.	Reasoning
At the outset, we do not wish to pronounce authoritatively on the Companies Law of Cayman Islands.	Reasoning
Be that as it may, under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, the situs of the shares would be where the company is incorporated and where its shares can be transferred.	Reasoning
In the present case, it has been asserted by VIH that the transfer of the CGP share was recorded in the Cayman Islands, where the register of members of the CGP is maintained.	Reasoning
This assertion has neither been rebutted in the impugned order of the Department dated 31.05.2010 nor traversed in the pleadings filed by the Revenue nor controverted before us.	Reasoning
In the circumstances, we are not inclined to accept the arguments of the Revenue that the situs of the CGP share was situated in the place (India) where the underlying assets stood situated.	Reasoning
Did VIH acquire 67 controlling interest in HEL (and not 42/ 52 as sought to be propounded)?	None
According to the Revenue, the entire case of VIH was that it had acquired only 42 (or, accounting for FIPB regulations, 52) is belied by clause 5.2 of the Shareholders Agreement.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this connection, it was urged that 15 in HEL was held by AS AG IDFC because of the FDI cap of 74 and, consequently, vide clause 5.2 of the Shareholders Agreement between these entities and HTIL downstream subsidiaries, AS AG IDFC were all reigned in by having to vote only in accordance with HTILs dictates as HTIL had funded the purchase by these gentlemen of the HEL shares through financing of loans.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, in the Term Sheet dated 15.03.2007, that is, between VIH and Essar, VIH had a right to nominate 8 directors (i.e. 67 of 12) and Essar had a right to nominate 4 directors which, according to the Revenue, evidences that VIH had acquired 67 interest in HEL and not 42/52, as sought to be propounded by it.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to the Revenue, right from 22.12.2006 onwards when HTIL made its first public announcement, HTIL on innumerable occasions represented its direct and indirect equity interest in HEL to be 67  the direct interest being 42.34 and indirect interest in the sense of shareholding belonging to Indian partners under its control, as 25.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, according to the Revenue, the purchase price paid by VIH was based on an enterprise value of 67 of the share capital of HEL this would never have been so if VIH was to buy only 42.34 of the share capital of HEL and that nobody would pay US 2.5 bn extra without control over 25 in HEL.	Arguments of Petitioner
We find no merit in the above submissions.	Reasoning
At the outset, it may be stated that the expression control is a mixed question of law and fact.	Reasoning
The basic argument of the Revenue is based on the equation of equity interest with the word control.	Reasoning
On perusal of Hutchison structure, we find that HTIL had, through its 100 wholly owned subsidiaries, invested in 42.34 of HEL (i.e. direct interest).	Reasoning
Similarly, HTIL had invested through its non100 wholly owned subsidiaries in 9.62 of HEL (through the pro rata route).	Reasoning
Thus, in the sense of shareholding, one can say that HTIL had an effective shareholding (direct and indirect interest) of 51.96 (approx.	Reasoning
52) in HEL.	Reasoning
On the basis of the shareholding test, HTIL could be said to have a 52 control over HEL.	Reasoning
By the same test, it could be equally said that the balance 15 stakes in HEL remained with AS, AG and IDFC (Indian partners) who had through their respective group companies invested 15 in HEL through TII and Omega and, consequently, HTIL had no control over 15 stakes in HEL.	Reasoning
At this stage, we may state that under the Hutchison structure shares of Plustech in the AG Group, shares of Scorpios in the AS Group and shares of SMMS came under the options held by GSPL.	Reasoning
Pending exercise, options are not management rights.	Reasoning
At the highest, options could be treated as potential shares and till exercised they cannot provide right to vote or management or control.	Reasoning
In the present case, till date GSPL has not exercised its rights under the Framework Agreement 2006 because of the sectoral cap of 74 which in turn restricts the right to vote.	Reasoning
Therefore, the transaction in the present case provides for a triggering event, viz.	Reasoning
relaxation of the sectoral cap.	Reasoning
Till such date, HTIL VIH cannot be said to have a control over 15 stakes in HEL.	Reasoning
It is for this reason that even FIPB gave its approval to the transaction by saying that VIH was acquiring or has acquired effective shareholding of 51.96 in HEL.	Reasoning
As regards the Term Sheet dated 15.03.2007, it may be stated that the said Term Sheet was entered into between VIH and Essar.	Reasoning
It was executed after 11.02.2007 when SPA was executed.	Reasoning
In the Term Sheet, it has been recited that the parties have agreed to enter into the Term Sheet in order to regulate the affairs of HEL and in order to regulate the relationship of shareholders of HEL.	Reasoning
It is also stated in the Term Sheet that VIH and Essar shall have to nominate directors on the Board of Directors of HEL in proportion to the aggregate beneficial shareholding held by members of the respective groups.	Reasoning
That, initially VIH shall be entitled to nominate 8 directors and Essar shall be entitled to nominate 4 directors out of a total Board of Directors of HEL (numbering 12).	Reasoning
We must understand the background of this Term Sheet.	Reasoning
Firstly, as stated the Term Sheet was entered into in order to regulate the affairs of HEL and to regulate the relationship of the shareholders of HEL.	Reasoning
It was necessary to enter into such an agreement for smooth running of the business post acquisition.	Reasoning
Secondly, we find from the letter addressed by HEL to FIPB dated 14.03.2007 that Articles of Association of HEL did not grant any specific person or entity a right to appoint directors.	Reasoning
The said directors were appointed by the shareholders of HEL in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Company Law.	Reasoning
The letter further states that in practice the directors were appointed pro rata to their respective shareholdings which resulted in 4 directors being appointed from Essar group, 6 directors being appointed by HTIL and 2 directors were appointed by TII.	Reasoning
One such director was AS, the other director was AG.	Reasoning
This was the practice even before the Term Sheet.	Reasoning
The Term Sheet continues this practice by guaranteeing or assuring Essar that 4 directors would be appointed from its Group.	Reasoning
The above facts indicate that the object of the SPA was to continue the practice concerning nomination of directors on the Board of Directors of HEL which in law is different from a right or power to control and manage and which practice was given to keep the business going, post acquisition.	Reasoning
Under the Company Law, the management control vests in the Board of Directors and not with the shareholders of the company.	Reasoning
Therefore, neither from Clause 5.2 of the Shareholders Agreement nor from the Term Sheet dated 15.03.2007, one could say that VIH had acquired 67 controlling interest in HEL.	Reasoning
As regards the question as to why VIH should pay consideration to HTIL based on an enterprise value of 67 of the share capital of HEL is concerned, it is important to note that valuation cannot be the basis of taxation.	Reasoning
The basis of taxation is profits or income or receipt.	Reasoning
In this case, we are not concerned with tax on income profit arising from business operations but with tax on transfer of rights (capital asset) and gains arising therefrom.	Reasoning
In the latter case, we have to see the conditions on which the tax becomes payable under the Income Tax Act.	Reasoning
Valuation may be a science, not law.	Reasoning
In valuation, to arrive at the value one has to take into consideration the business realities, like the business model, the duration of its operations, concepts such as cash flow, the discounting factors, assets and liabilities, intangibles, etc.	Reasoning
In the present case, VIH paid US 11.08 bn for 67 of the enterprise value of HEL plus its downstream companies having operational licences.	Reasoning
It bought an upstream company with the intention that rights flowing from the CGP share would enable it to gain control over the cluster of Indian operations or operating companies which owned telecom licences, business assets, etc.	Reasoning
VIH agreed to acquire companies which in turn controlled a 67 interest in HEL and its subsidiaries.	Reasoning
Valuation is a matter of opinion.	Reasoning
When the entire business or investment is sold, for valuation purposes, one may take into account the economic interest or realities.	Reasoning
Risks as a discounting factor are also to be taken into consideration apart from loans, receivables, options, RoFR TAR, etc.	Reasoning
In this case, Enterprise Value is made up of two parts, namely, the value of HEL, the value of CGP and the companies between CGP and HEL.	Reasoning
In the present case, the Revenue cannot invoke Section 9 of the Income Tax Act on the value of the underlying asset or consequence of acquiring a share of CGP.	Reasoning
In the present case, the Valuation done was on the basis of enterprise value.	Reasoning
The price paid as a percentage of the enterprise value had to be 67 not because the figure of 67 was available in praesenti to VIH, but on account of the fact that the competing Indian bidders would have had de facto access to the entire 67, as they were not subject to the limitation of sectoral cap, and, therefore, would have immediately encashed the call options.	Reasoning
The question still remains as to from where did this figure expression of 67 of equity interest come?	Reasoning
The expression equity interest came from US GAAP.	Reasoning
In this connection, we have examined the Notes to the Accounts annexed to the Annual Report 2006 of HTIL.	Reasoning
According to Note 1, the ordinary shares of HTIL stood listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as well as on the New York Stock Exchange.	Reasoning
In Note No. 36, a list of principal subsidiaries of HTIL as on 31.12.2006 has been attached.	Reasoning
This list shows the names of HEL (India) and some of its subsidiaries.	Reasoning
In the said Annual Report, there is an annexure to the said Notes to the Accounts under the caption Information for US Investors.	Reasoning
It refers to Variable Interest Entities (VIEs).	Reasoning
According to the Annual Report, the Vodafone Group consisting of HTIL and its subsidiaries conducted its operations inter alia in India through entities in which HTIL did not have the voting control.	Reasoning
Since HTIL was listed on New York Stock Exchange, it had to follow for accounting and disclosure the rules prescribed by US GAAP.	Reasoning
Now, in the present case, HTIL as a listed company was required to make disclosures of potential risk involved in the investment under the Hutchison structure.	Reasoning
HTIL had furnished Letters of Credit to Rabo Bank which in turn had funded AS and AG, who in turn had agreed to place the shares of Plustech and Scorpios under Options held by GSPL.	Reasoning
Thus, giving of the Letters of Credit and placing the shares of Plustech and Scorpios under Options were required to be disclosed to the US investors under the US GAAP, unlike Indian GAAP.	Reasoning
Thus, the difference between the 52 figure (control) and 67 (equity interest) arose on account of the difference in computation under the Indian and US GAAP.	Reasoning
Approach of the High Court (acquisition of CGP share with other rights and entitlements)	Reasoning
Applying the nature and character of the transaction test, the High Court came to the conclusion that the transfer of the CGP share was not adequate in itself to achieve the object of consummating the transaction between HTIL and VIH.	Reasoning
That, intrinsic to the transaction was a transfer of other rights and entitlements which rights and entitlements constituted in themselves capital assets within the meaning of Section 2(14) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.	Reasoning
According to the High Court, VIH acquired the CGP share with other rights and entitlements whereas, according to the appellant, whatever VIH obtained was through the CGP share (for short High Court Approach).	Reasoning
At the outset, it needs to be mentioned that the Revenue has adopted the abovementioned High Court Approach as an alternative contention.	Reasoning
We have to view the subject matter of the transaction, in this case, from a commercial and realistic perspective.	Reasoning
The present case concerns an offshore transaction involving a structured investment.	Reasoning
This case concerns a share sale and not an asset sale.	Reasoning
It concerns sale of an entire investment.	Reasoning
A sale may take various forms.	Reasoning
Accordingly, tax consequences will vary.	Reasoning
The tax consequences of a share sale would be different from the tax consequences of an asset sale.	Reasoning
A slump sale would involve tax consequences which could be different from the tax consequences of sale of assets on itemized basis.	Reasoning
Control is a mixed question of law and fact.	Reasoning
Ownership of shares may, in certain situations, result in the assumption of an interest which has the character of a controlling interest in the management of the company.	Reasoning
A controlling interest is an incident of ownership of shares in a company, something which flows out of the holding of shares.	Reasoning
A controlling interest is, therefore, not an identifiable or distinct capital asset independent of the holding of shares.	Reasoning
The control of a company resides in the voting power of its shareholders and shares represent an interest of a shareholder which is made up of various rights contained in the contract embedded in the Articles of Association.	Reasoning
The right of a shareholder may assume the character of a controlling interest where the extent of the shareholding enables the shareholder to control the management.	Reasoning
Shares, and the rights which emanate from them, flow together and cannot be dissected.	Reasoning
In the felicitous phrase of Lord MacMillan in IRC v. Crossman 1936 1 All ER 762, shares in a company consist of a congeries of rights and liabilities which are a creature of the Companies Acts and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company.	Reasoning
Thus, control and management is a facet of the holding of shares.	Reasoning
Applying the above principles governing shares and the rights of the shareholders to the facts of this case, we find that this case concerns a straightforward share sale.	Reasoning
VIH acquired Upstream shares with the intention that the congeries of rights, flowing from the CGP share, would give VIH an indirect control over the three genres of companies.	Reasoning
If one looks at the chart indicating the Ownership Structure, one finds that the acquisition of the CGP share gave VIH an indirect control over the tier I Mauritius companies which owned shares in HEL totalling to 42.34 CGP India (Ms), which in turn held shares in TII and Omega and which on a pro rata basis (the FDI principle), totalled up to 9.62 in HEL and an indirect control over Hutchison TeleServices (India) Holdings Ltd. (Ms), which in turn owned shares in GSPL, which held call and put options.	Reasoning
Although the High Court has analysed the transactional documents in detail, it has missed out this aspect of the case.	Reasoning
It has failed to notice that till date options have remained unencashed with GSPL.	Reasoning
Therefore, even if it be assumed that the options under the Framework Agreements 2006 could be considered to be property rights, there has been no transfer or assignment of options by GSPL till today.	Reasoning
Even if it be assumed that the High Court was right in holding that the options constituted capital assets even then Section 9(1)(i) was not applicable as these options have not been transferred till date.	Reasoning
Call and put options were not transferred vide SPA dated 11.02.2007 or under any other document whatsoever.	Reasoning
Moreover, if, on principle, the High Court accepts that the transfer of the CGP share did not lead to the transfer of a capital asset in India, even if it resulted in a transfer of indirect control over 42.34 (52) of shares in HEL, then surely the transfer of indirect control over GSPL which held options (contractual rights), would not make the transfer of the CGP share taxable in India.	Reasoning
Acquisition of the CGP share which gave VIH an indirect control over three genres of companies evidences a straightforward share sale and not an asset sale.	Reasoning
There is another fallacy in the impugned judgment.	Reasoning
On examination of the impugned judgment, we find a serious error committed by the High Court in appreciating the case of VIH before FIPB.	Reasoning
On 19.03.2007, FIPB sought a clarification from VIH of the circumstances in which VIH agreed to pay US 11.08 bn for acquiring 67 of HEL when actual acquisition was of 51.96.	Reasoning
In its response dated 19.03.2007, VIH stated that it had agreed to acquire from HTIL for US 11.08 bn, interest in HEL which included a 52 equity shareholding.	Reasoning
According to VIH, the price also included a control premium, use of Hutch brand in India, a noncompete agreement, loan obligations and an entitlement to acquire, subject to the Indian FDI rules, a further 15 indirect interest in HEL.	Reasoning
According to the said letter, the above elements together equated to 67 of the economic value of HEL.	Reasoning
This sentence has been misconstrued by the High Court to say that the above elements equated to 67 of the equity capital (See para 124).	Reasoning
67 of the economic value of HEL is not 67 of the equity capital.	Reasoning
If VIH would have acquired 67 of the equity capital, as held by the High Court, the entire investment would have had breached the FDI norms which had imposed a sectoral cap of 74.	Reasoning
In this connection, it may further be stated that Essar had 33 stakes in HEL out of which 22 was held by Essar Mauritius.	Reasoning
Thus, VIH did not acquire 67 of the equity capital of HEL, as held by the High Court.	Reasoning
This problem has arisen also because of the reason that this case deals with share sale and not asset sale.	Reasoning
This case does not involve sale of assets on itemized basis.	Reasoning
The High Court ought to have applied the look at test in which the entire Hutchison structure, as it existed, ought to have been looked at holistically.	Reasoning
This case concerns investment into India by a holding company (parent company), HTIL through a maze of subsidiaries.	Reasoning
When one applies the nature and character of the transaction test, confusion arises if a dissecting approach of examining each individual asset is adopted.	Reasoning
As stated, CGP was treated in the Hutchison structure as an investment vehicle.	Reasoning
As a general rule, in a case where a transaction involves transfer of shares lock, stock and barrel, such a transaction cannot be broken up into separate individual components, assets or rights such as right to vote, right to participate in company meetings, management rights, controlling rights, control premium, brand licences and so on as shares constitute a bundle of rights.	Reasoning
See Charanjit Lal v. Union of India AIR 1951 SC 41, Venkatesh (minor) v. CIT 243 ITR 367 (Mad) and Smt.	Reasoning
Maharani Ushadevi v. CIT 131 ITR 445 (MP) Further, the High Court has failed to examine the nature of the following items, namely, noncompete agreement, control premium, call and put options, consultancy support, customer base, brand licences etc.	Reasoning
On facts, we are of the view that the High Court, in the present case, ought to have examined the entire transaction holistically.	Reasoning
VIH has rightly contended that the transaction in question should be looked at as an entire package.	Reasoning
The items mentioned hereinabove, like, control premium, noncompete agreement, consultancy support, customer base, brand licences, operating licences etc. were all an integral part of the Holding Subsidiary Structure which existed for almost 13 years, generating huge revenues, as indicated above.	Reasoning
Merely because at the time of exit capital gains tax becomes not payable or exigible to tax would not make the entire share sale (investment) a sham or a tax avoidant.	Reasoning
The High Court has failed to appreciate that the payment of US 11.08 bn was for purchase of the entire investment made by HTIL in India.	Reasoning
The payment was for the entire package.	None
The parties to the transaction have not agreed upon a separate price for the CGP share and for what the High Court calls as other rights and entitlements (including options, right to noncompete, control premium, customer base etc.).	Reasoning
Thus, it was not open to the Revenue to split the payment and consider a part of such payments for each of the above items.	Reasoning
The essential character of the transaction as an alienation cannot be altered by the form of the consideration, the payment of the consideration in instalments or on the basis that the payment is related to a contingency (options, in this case), particularly when the transaction does not contemplate such a split up.	Reasoning
Where the parties have agreed for a lump sum consideration without placing separate values for each of the above items which go to make up the entire investment in participation, merely because certain values are indicated in the correspondence with FIPB which had raised the query, would not mean that the parties had agreed for the price payable for each of the above items.	Reasoning
The transaction remained a contract of outright sale of the entire investment for a lump sum consideration see Commentary on Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital dated 28.01.2003 as also the judgment of this Court in the case of IT (Central), Calcutta v. Mugneeram Bangur and Company (Land Deptt.), (1965) 57 ITR 299 (SC).	Reasoning
Thus, we need to look at the entire Ownership Structure set up by Hutchison as a single consolidated bargain and interpret the transactional documents, while examining the Offshore Transaction of the nature involved in this case, in that light.	Reasoning
Scope and applicability of Sections 195 and 163 of IT Act 89.	Reasoning
Section 195 casts an obligation on the payer to deduct tax at source (TAS for short) from payments made to nonresidents which payments are chargeable to tax.	Reasoning
Such payment(s) must have an element of income embedded in it which is chargeable to tax in India.	Reasoning
If the sum paid or credited by the payer is not chargeable to tax then no obligation to deduct the tax would arise.	Reasoning
Shareholding in companies incorporated outside India (CGP) is property located outside India.	Reasoning
Where such shares become subject matter of offshore transfer between two nonresidents, there is no liability for capital gains tax.	Reasoning
In such a case, question of deduction of TAS would not arise.	Reasoning
If in law the responsibility for payment is on a nonresident, the fact that the payment was made, under the instructions of the nonresident, to its Agent Nominee in India or its PE Branch Office will not absolve the payer of his liability under Section 195 to deduct TAS.	Reasoning
Section 195(1) casts a duty upon the payer of any income specified therein to a nonresident to deduct therefrom the TAS unless such payer is himself liable to pay incometax thereon as an Agent of the payee.	Reasoning
Section 201 says that if such person fails to so deduct	None
TAS he shall be deemed to be an assesseeindefault in respect of the deductible amount of tax (Section 201).	None
Liability to deduct tax is different from assessment under the Act.	None
Thus, the person on whom the obligation to deduct TAS is cast is not the person who has earned the income.	None
Assessment has to be done after liability to deduct TAS has arisen.	None
The object of Section 195 is to ensure that tax due from nonresident persons is secured at the earliest point of time so that there is no difficulty in collection of tax subsequently at the time of regular assessment.	None
The present case concerns the transaction of outright sale between two nonresidents of a capital asset (share) outside India.	None
Further, the said transaction was entered into on principal to principal basis.	Reasoning
Therefore, no liability to deduct TAS arose.	Reasoning
Further, in the case of transfer of the Structure in its entirety, one has to look at it holistically as one Single Consolidated Bargain which took place between two foreign companies outside India for which a lump sum price was paid of US 11.08 bn.	Reasoning
Under the transaction, there was no split up of payment of US 11.08 bn.	Reasoning
It is the Revenue which has split the consolidated payment and it is the Revenue which wants to assign a value to the rights to control premium, right to noncompete, right to consultancy support etc.	Reasoning
For FDI purposes, the FIPB had asked VIH for the basis of fixing the price of US 11.08 bn.	Reasoning
But here also, there was no split up of lump sum payment, assetwise as claimed by the Revenue.	Reasoning
There was no assignment of price for each right, considered by the Revenue to be a capital asset in the transaction.	Reasoning
In the absence of PE, profits were not attributable to Indian operations.	Reasoning
Moreover, tax presence has to be viewed in the context of the transaction that is subjected to tax and not with reference to an entirely unrelated matter.	Reasoning
The investment made by Vodafone Group companies in Bharti did not make all entities of that Group subject to the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 and the jurisdiction of the tax authorities.	Reasoning
Tax presence must be construed in the context, and in a manner that brings the nonresident assessee under the jurisdiction of the Indian tax authorities.	Reasoning
Lastly, in the present case, the Revenue has failed to establish any connection with Section 9(1)(i).	Reasoning
Under the circumstances, Section 195 is not applicable.	Reasoning
Alternatively, the Revenue contended before us that VIH can be proceeded against as representative assessee under Section 163 of the Act.	Reasoning
Section 163 does not relate to deduction of tax.	Reasoning
It relates to treatment of a purchaser of an asset as a representative assessee.	Reasoning
A conjoint reading of Section 160(1)(i), Section 161(1) and Section 163 of the Act shows that, under given circumstances, certain persons can be treated as representative assessee on behalf of nonresident specified in Section 9(1).	Reasoning
This would include an agent of nonresident and also who is treated as an agent under Section 163 of the Act which in turn deals with special cases where a person can be regarded as an agent.	Reasoning
Once a person comes within any of the clauses of Section 163(1), such a person would be the Agent of the nonresident for the purposes of the Act.	Reasoning
However, merely because a person is an agent or is to be treated as an agent, would not lead to an automatic conclusion that he becomes liable to pay taxes on behalf of the nonresident.	Reasoning
It would only mean that he is to be treated as a representative assessee.	Reasoning
Section 161 of the Act makes a representative assessee liable only as regards the income in respect of which he is a representative assessee (See Section 161).	Reasoning
Section 161 of the Act makes a representative assessee liable only if the eventualities stipulated in Section 161 are satisfied.	Reasoning
This is the scope of Sections 9(1)(i), 160(1), 161(1) read with Sections 163(1) (a) to (d).	Reasoning
In the present case, the Department has invoked Section 163(1)(c).	Reasoning
Both Sections 163(1)(c) and Section 9(1)(i) state that income should be deemed to accrue or arise in India.	Reasoning
Both these Sections have to be read together.	Reasoning
On facts of this case, we hold that Section 163(1)(c) is not attracted as there is no transfer of a capital asset situated in India.	Reasoning
Thus, Section 163(1)(c) is not attracted.	Reasoning
Consequently, VIH cannot be proceeded against even under Section 163 of the Act as a representative assessee.	Reasoning
For the reasons given above, there is no necessity of examining the written submissions advanced on behalf of VIH by Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Sections 191 and 201.	Reasoning
Summary of Findings Applying the look at test in order to ascertain the true nature and character of the transaction, we hold, that the Offshore Transaction herein is a bonafide structured FDI 1 investment into India which fell outside Indias territorial tax jurisdiction, hence not taxable.	None
The said Offshore Transaction evidences participative investment and not a sham or tax avoidant preordained transaction.	None
The said Offshore Transaction was between HTIL (a Cayman Islands company) and VIH (a company incorporated in Netherlands).	None
The subject matter of the Transaction was the transfer of the CGP (a company incorporated in Cayman Islands).	None
Consequently, the Indian Tax Authority had no territorial tax jurisdiction to tax the said Offshore Transaction.	None
Conclusion FDI flows towards location with a strong governance infrastructure which includes enactment of laws and how well the legal system works.	Reasoning
Certainty is integral to rule of law.	Reasoning
Certainty and stability form the basic foundation of any fiscal system.	Reasoning
Tax policy certainty is crucial for taxpayers (including foreign investors) to make rational economic choices in the most efficient manner.	Reasoning
Legal doctrines like Limitation of Benefits and look through are matters of policy.	Reasoning
It is for the Government of the day to have them incorporated in the Treaties and in the laws so as to avoid conflicting views.	Reasoning
Investors should know where they stand.	Reasoning
It also helps the tax administration in enforcing the provisions of the taxing laws.	Reasoning
As stated above, the Hutchison structure has existed since 1994.	Reasoning
According to the details submitted on behalf of the appellant, we find that from 200203 to 201011 the Group has contributed an amount of 20,242 crores towards direct and indirect taxes on its business operations in India.	Reasoning
Order For the above reasons, we set aside the impugned judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 8.09.2010 in Writ Petition No. 1325 of 2010.	Decision
Accordingly, the Civil Appeal stands allowed with no order as to costs.	Decision
The Department is hereby directed to return the sum of 2,500 crores, which came to be deposited by the appellant in terms of our interim order, with interest at the rate of 4 per annum within two months from today.	Decision
The interest shall be calculated from the date of withdrawal by the Department from the Registry of the Supreme Court up to the date of payment.	Decision
The Registry is directed to return the Bank Guarantee given by the appellant within four weeks.	Decision
S. Radhakrishnan, J. The question involved in this case is of considerable public importance, especially on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), which is indispensable for a growing economy like India.	Issue
Foreign investments in India are generally routed through Offshore Finance Centres (OFC) also through the countries with whom India has entered into treaties.	Issue
Overseas investments in Joint Ventures (JV) and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOS) have been recognised as important avenues of global business in India.	None
Potential users of offshore finance are international companies, individuals, investors and others and capital flows through FDI, Portfolio Debt Investment and Foreign Portfolio Equity Investment and so on.	None
Demand for offshore facilities has considerably increased owing to high growth rates of crossborder investments and a number of rich global investors have come forward to use high technology and communication infrastructures.	None
Removal of barriers to crossborder trade, the liberalisation of financial markets and new communication technologies have had positive effects on global economic growth and India has also been greatly benefited.	None
Several international organisations like UN, FATF, OECD, Council of Europe and the European Union offer finance, one way or the other, for setting up companies all over the world.	None
Many countries have entered into treaties with several offshore companies for crossborder investments for mutual benefits.	None

Under the FDI Scheme, investment can be made by availing the benefit of treaties, or through tax havens by nonresidents in the share convertible debentures preference shares of an Indian company but the question which looms large is whether our Company Law, Tax Laws and Regulatory Laws have been updated so that there can be greater scrutiny of nonresident enterprises, ranging from foreign contractors and service providers, to finance investors.	None
Case in hand is an eyeopener of what we lack in our regulatory laws and what measures we have to take to meet the various unprecedented situations, that too without sacrificing national interest.	None
Certainty in law in dealing with such crossborder investment issues is of prime importance, which has been felt by many countries around the world and some have taken adequate regulatory measures so that investors can arrange their affairs fruitfully and effectively.	None
Steps taken by various countries to meet such situations may also guide us, a brief reference of which is being made in the later part of this judgment.	None
We are, in the present case, concerned with a matter relating to crossborder investment and the legal issues emanate from that.	None
Facts have been elaborately dealt with by the High Court in the impugned judgment and also in the leading judgment of Lord Chief Justice, but reference to few facts is necessary to address and answer the core issues raised.	None

The Bombay High Court dismissed the Writ Petition on 08.09.2010 against which the present SLP has been filed.	None
The High Court upheld the jurisdiction of the Revenue to impose capital gains tax on Vodafone as a representative assessee after holding that the transaction between the parties attracted capital gains in India.	None
Court came to the following conclusions Transactions between HTIL and Vodafone were fulfilled not merely by transferring a single share of CGP in Cayman Islands, but the commercial and business understanding between the parties postulated that what was being transferred from HTIL to VIHBV was the controlling interest in HEL in India, which is an identifiable capital asset independent of CGP share.	None
HTIL had put into place during the period when it was in the control of HEL a complex structure including the financing of Indian companies which in turn had holdings directly or indirectly in HEL and hence got controlling interest in HEL.	None
Vodafone on purchase of CGP got indirect interest in HEL, controlling right in certain indirect holding companies in HEL, controlling rights through shareholder agreements which included the right to appoint directors in certain indirect holding companies in HEL, interest in the form of preference share capital in indirect holding companies of HEL, rights to use Hutch brand in India, noncompete agreement with Hutch brand in India etc., which all constitute capital asset as per Section 2(14) of the I.T. Act.	None
The price paid by Vodafone to HTIL of US 11.08 billion factored in as part of the consideration of those diverse rights and entitlements and many of those entitlements are relatable to the transfer of CGP share and that the transactional documents are merely incidental or consequential to the transfer of CGP share but recognized independently the rights and entitlements of HTIL in relation to Indian business which are being transferred to VIHBV.	None
High Court held that the transfer of CGP share was not adequate in itself to achieve the object of consummating the transaction between HTIL and VIHBV and the rights and entitlements followed would amount to capital gains.	Reasoning
The Court also held that where an asset or source of income is situated in India, the income of which accrues or arises directly or indirectly through or from it shall be treated as income which is deemed to accrue or arise in India, hence, chargeable under Section 9(1)(i) or 163 of the I.T. Act.	None
Court directed the Assessing Officer to do apportionment of income between the income that has deemed to accrue or arise as a result of nexus with India and that which lies outside.	None
High Court also concluded that the provisions of Section 195 can apply to a nonresident provided there is sufficient territorial connection or nexus between him and India.	None
Vodafone, it was held, by virtue of its diverse agreements has nexus with Indian jurisdiction and, hence, the proceedings initiated under Section 201 for failure to withhold tax by Vodafone cannot be held to lack jurisdiction.	None
Shri Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing for Vodafone explained in detail how Hutchison Corporate Structure was built up and the purpose, object and relevance of such vertical Transnational Structures in the international context.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior counsel submitted that complex structures are designed not for avoiding tax but for good commercial reasons and Indian legal structure and foreign exchange laws recognize Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCB).	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel also submitted that such Transnational Structures also contain exit option to the investors.	Arguments of Petitioner
Senior counsel also pointed out that where regulatory provisions mandate investment into corporate structure such structures cannot be disregarded for tax purposes by lifting the corporate veil especially when there is no motive to avoid tax.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Salve also submitted that Hutchison corporate structure was not designed to avoid tax and the transaction was not a colourable device to achieve that purpose.	Arguments of Petitioner
Senior counsel also submitted that source of income lies where the transaction is effected and not where the underlying asset is situated or economic interest lies.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference was made to judgment in Seth Pushalal Mansinghka (P) Ltd. v. CIT (1967)	Arguments of Petitioner
66 ITR 159 (SC).	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel also pointed out that without any express legislation, offshore transaction cannot be taxed in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference was made to two judgments of the Calcutta High Court Assam Consolidated Tea Estates v. Income Tax Officer A Ward (1971) 81 ITR 699 Cal.	Arguments of Petitioner
and C.I.T. West Bengal v. National and Grindlays Bank Ltd. (1969) 72 ITR 121 Cal.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel also pointed out that when a transaction is between two foreign entities and not with an Indian entity, source of income cannot be traced back to India and nexus cannot be used to tax under Section 9.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it was also pointed out that language in Section 9 does not contain look through provisions and even the words indirectly or through appearing in Section 9 would not make a transaction of a nonresident taxable in India unless there is a transfer of capital asset situated in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior counsel also submitted that the Income Tax Department has committed an error in proceeding on a moving theory of nexus on the basis that economic interest and underlying asset are situated in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was pointed out that there cannot be transfer of controlling interest in a Company independent from transfer of shares and under the provisions of the Company Law.	Arguments of Petitioner
Acquisition of shares in a Company entitles the Board a right of control over the Company.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior Counsel also pointed out the right to vote, right to appoint Board of Directors, and other management rights are incidental to the ownership of shares and there is no change of control in the eye of law but only in commercial terms.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Salve emphasized that, in absence of the specific legislation, such transactions should not be taxed.	Arguments of Petitioner
On the situs of shares, learned senior counsel pointed out that the situs is determined depending upon the place where the asset is situated.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel also pointed out that on transfer of CGP, Vodafone got control over HEL and merely because Vodafone has presence or chargeable income in India, it cannot be inferred that it can be taxed in some other transactions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it was also pointed out that there was no transfer of any capital asset from HTIL to Vodafone pursuant to Option Agreements, FWAs, executed by the various Indian subsidiaries.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior Counsel also pointed out that the definition of transfer under Section 2(47) which provides for extinguishment is attracted for a transfer of a legal right and not a contractual right and there was no extinguishment of right by HTIL which gave rise to capital gains tax in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference was made to judgment CIT v. Grace Collis (2001) 3 SCC 430.	None
Learned senior counsel also submitted that the acquisition of controlling interest is a commercial concept and tax is levied on transaction and not its effect.	None
Learned senior counsel pointed out that to lift the corporate veil of a legally recognised corporate structure time and the stage of the transaction are very important and not the motive to save the tax.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference was also made to several judgments of the English Courts viz, IRC v. Duke of Westminster (1936)	Arguments of Petitioner
AC 1 (HL), W. T. Ramsay v. IRC (1982)	Arguments of Petitioner
AC 300 (HL), Craven v. White (1988) 3	Arguments of Petitioner
All ER 495, Furniss v. Dawson (1984) 1 All ER 530 etc.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reference was also made to the judgment of this Court in McDowell, Azadi Bachao Andolan cases (supra) and few other judgments.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel point out that Azadi Bachao Andolan broadly reflects Indian jurisprudence and that generally Indian courts used to follow the principles laid down by English Courts on the issue of tax avoidance and tax evasion.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned Senior counsel also submitted that Tax Residency Certificate (for short TRC) issued by the Mauritian authorities has to be respected and in the absence of any Limitation on Benefit (LOB Clause), the benefit of the IndoMauritian Treaty is available to third parties who invest in India through Mauritius route.	Arguments of Petitioner
39.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Salve also argued on the extra territorial applicability of Section 195 and submitted that the same cannot be enforced on a nonresident without a presence in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Counsel also pointed out that the words any person in Section 195 should be construed to apply to payers who have a presence in India or else enforcement would be impossible and such a provision should be read down in case of payments not having any nexus with India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Senior counsel also submitted that the withholding tax provisions under Section 195 of the Indian Income Tax Act, do not apply to offshore entities making offshore payments and the said Section could be triggered only if it can be established that the payment under consideration is of a sum chargeable under the Income Tax Act (for short IT Act).	Arguments of Petitioner
Senior counsel therefore contended that the findings of the Tax Authorities that pursuant to the transaction the benefit of telecom licence stood transferred to Vodafone is misconceived and that under the telecom policy of India a telecom licence can be held only by an Indian Company and there is no transfer direct or indirect of any licence to Vodafone.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. R.F. Nariman, Learned Solicitor General appearing for the Income Tax Department submitted that the sale of CGP share was nothing but an artificial avoidance scheme and CGP was fished out of the HTIL legal structure as an artificial tax avoidance contrivance.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Nariman pointed out that CGP share has been interposed at the last minute to artificially remove HTIL from the Indian telecom business.	Arguments of Respondent
Reference was made to the Due Diligence Report of Ernst and Young which stated that target structure later included CGP which was not there originally.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it was also pointed out that HTIL extinguished its rights in HEL and put Vodafone in its place and CGP was merely an interloper.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Nariman also pointed out that as per Settlement Agreement, HTIL sold direct and indirect equity holdings, loans, other interests and rights relating to HEL which clearly reveal something other than CGP share was sold and those transactions were exposed by the SPA.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Solicitor General also referred extensively the provisions of SPA and submitted that the legal owner of CGP is HTIBVI Holdings Ltd., a British Virgin Islands Company which was excluded from the Agreement with an oblique tax motive.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Nariman also submitted the situs of CGP can only be in India as the entire business purpose of holding that share was to assume control in Indian telecom operations, the same was managed through Board of Directors controlled by HTIL.	Arguments of Respondent
The controlling interest expressed by HTIL would amount to property rights and hence taxable in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Reference was made to judgments of the Calcutta High Court in CIT v. National Insurance Company (1978) 113 ITR 37(Cal.)	Arguments of Respondent
and	Arguments of Respondent
Laxmi Insurance Company Pvt. Ltd. v. CIT (1971) 80 ITR 575 (Delhi).	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it was also ointed out the call and put options despite being a ontingent right are capable of being transferred and they re property rights and not merely contractual rights and hence would be taxable.	Arguments of Respondent
Referring to the SPA Shri Nariman submitted that the transaction can be viewed as extinguishment of HTILs property rights in India and CGP share was merely a mode to transfer capital assets in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it was also pointed out that the charging Section should be construed purposively and it contains a look through provision and that the definition of the transfer in Section 9(1)(i) is an inclusive definition meant to explain the scope of that Section and not to limit it.	Arguments of Respondent
The resignation of HTIL Directors on the Board of HEL could be termed as extinguishment and the right to manage a Company through its Board of Directors is a right to property.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Solicitor General also extensively referred to Ramsay Doctrine and submitted that if business purpose as opposed to effect is to artificially avoid tax then that step should be ignored and the courts should adopt a purposive construction on the SPA.	Arguments of Respondent
Considerable reliance was placed on judgment of this Court in Mc.Dowell and submitted that the same be followed and not Azadi Bachao Andolan which has been incorrectly decided.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it was also pointed out that Circular No.789 as regards the conclusiveness of TRC would apply only to dividend clause and as regards capital gains, it would still have to satisfy the twin tests of Article 13(4) of the treaty namely the shares being alienated and the gains being derived by a Mauritian entity.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned Solicitor General also submitted that the Department can make an enquiry into whether capital gains have been factually and legally assigned to a Mauritian entity or to third party and whether the Mauritian Company was a facade.	Arguments of Respondent
42.	None
Learned counsels, on either side, in support of their respective contentions, referred to several judgments of this Court, foreign Courts, international expert opinions, authoritative articles written by eminent authors etc.	None
Before examining the same, let us first examine the legal status of a corporate structure, its usefulness in crossborder transactions and other legal and commercial principles in use in such transactions, which are germane to our case.	None
Part  II CORPORATE STRUCTURE GENERAL PRINCIPLES (National and International)	None
Corporate structure is primarily created for business and commercial purposes and multinational companies who make offshore investments always aim at better returns to the shareholders and the progress of their companies.	None
Corporation created for such purposes are legal entities distinct from its members and are capable of enjoying rights and of being subject to duties which are not the same as those enjoyed or borne by its members.	None
Multinational companies, for corporate governance, may develop corporate structures, affiliate subsidiaries, joint ventures for operational efficiency, tax avoidance, mitigate risks etc.	None
On incorporation, the corporate property belongs to the company and members have no direct proprietary rights to it but merely to their shares in the undertaking and these shares constitute items of property which are freely transferable in the absence of any express provision to the contrary.	None
Corporate structure created for genuine business purposes are those which are generally created or acquired at the time when investment is being made or further investments are being made or the time when the Group is undergoing financial or other overall restructuring or when operations, such as consolidation, are carried out, to cleandefused or overdiversified.	None
Sound commercial reasons like hedging business risk, hedging political risk, mobility of investment, ability to raise loans from diverse investments, often underlie creation of such structures.	None
In transnational investments, the use of a tax neutral and investorfriendly countries to establish SPV is motivated by the need to create a tax efficient structure to eliminate double taxation wherever possible and also plan their activities attracting no or lesser tax so as to give maximum benefit to the investors.	None
Certain countries are exempted from capital gain, certain countries are partially exempted and, in certain countries, there is nil tax on capital gains.	None
Such factors may go in creating a corporate structure and also restructuring.	None
Corporate structure may also have an exit route, especially when investment is overseas.	None
For purely commercial reasons, a foreign group may wind up its activities overseas for better returns, due to disputes between partners, unfavourable fiscal policies, uncertain political situations, strengthen fiscal loans and its application, threat to its investment, insecurity, weak and time consuming judicial system etc., all can be contributing factors that may drive its exit or restructuring.	None
Clearly, there is a fundamental difference in transnational investment made overseas and domestic investment.	None
Domestic investments are made in the home country and meant to stay as it were, but when the transnational investment is made overseas away from the natural residence of the investing company, provisions are usually made for exit route to facilitate an exit as and when necessary for good business and commercial reasons, which is generally foreign to judicial review.	None
Revenue Courts can always examine whether those corporate structures are genuine and set up legally for a sound and veritable commercial purpose.	None
Burden is entirely on the Revenue to show that the incorporation, consolidation, restructuring etc. has been effected to achieve a fraudulent, dishonest purpose, so as to defeat the law.	None
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Corporate governance has been a subject of considerable interest in the corporate world.	None
The Organisation for Economic cooperation and Development (OECD) defines corporate governance as follows  Corporate governance is a system by which business corporations are directed and controlled.	None
The corporate governance structure specifies the distribution of rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation and other stake holders and spells out rules and procedures for making decisions on corporate affairs.	None
By doing this, it also provides a structure through which the company objectives are set and the means of attaining those objectives and monitoring performance.	None
The Ministry of Corporate Affairs to the Government of India, has issued several press notes for information of such global companies, which will indicate that Indian corporate Law has also accepted the corporate structure consisting of holding companies and several subsidiary companies.	None
A holding company which owns enough voting stock in a subsidiary can control management and operation by influencing or electing its Board of Directors.	None
The holding company can also maintain group accounts which is to give members of the holding company a picture of the financial position of the holding company and its subsidiaries.	None
The form and content of holding company or subsidiary companys own balance sheet and profit and loss account are the same as if they were independent companies except that a holding companys accounts an aggregated value of shares it holds in its subsidiaries and in related companies and aggregated amount of loss made by it to its subsidiaries and to related companies and their other indebtedness to it must be shown separately from other assets etc.	None
Corporate governors can also misuse their office, using fraudulent means for unlawful gain, they may also manipulate their records, enter into dubious transactions for tax evasion.	None
Burden is always on the Revenue to expose and prove such transactions are fraudulent by applying look at principle.	None
OVERSEAS COMPANIES AND FDI Overseas companies are companies incorporated outside India and neither the Companies Act nor the Income Tax Act enacted in India has any control over those companies established overseas and they are governed by the laws in the countries where they are established.	None
From country to country laws governing incorporation, management, control, taxation etc. may change.	None
Many developed and wealthy Nations may park their capital in such offshore companies to carry on business operations in other countries in the world.	None
Many countries give facilities for establishing companies in their jurisdiction with minimum control and maximum freedom.	None
Competition is also there among various countries for setting up such offshore companies in their jurisdiction.	None
Demand for offshore facilities has considerably increased, in recent times, owing to high growth rates of crossborder investments and to the increased number of rich investors who are prepared to use high technology and communication infrastructures to go offshore.	None
Removal of barriers to crossborder trade, the liberalization of financial markets and new communication technologies have had positive effects on the developing countries including India.	None
Investment under foreign Direct Investment Scheme (FDI scheme), investment by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) under the Portfolio Investment Scheme, investment by NRIs OBCs under the Portfolio Investment Scheme and sale of shares by NRIs OBCs on nonrepatriation basis Purchase and sale of securities other than shares and convertible debentures of an Indian company by a nonresident are common.	None
Press Notes are announced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry issued Press Note no. 2, 2009 and Press Note 3, 2009, which deals with calculation of foreign investment in downstream entities and requirement of ownership or control in sectoral cap companies.	None
Many of the offshore companies use the facilities of Offshore Financial Centres situate in Mauritius, Cayman Islands etc.	None
Many of these offshore holdings and arrangements are undertaken for sound commercial and legitimate tax planning reasons, without any intent to conceal income or assets from the home country tax jurisdiction and India has always encouraged such arrangements, unless it is fraudulent or fictitious.	None
Moving offshore or using an OFC does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that they involve in the activities of tax evasion or other criminal activities.	None
The multinational companies are attracted to offshore financial centres mainly due to the reason of providing attractive facilities for the investment.	None
Many corporate conglomerates employ a large number of holding companies and often highrisk assets are parked in separate companies so as to avoid legal and technical risks to the main group.	None
Instances are also there when individuals form offshore vehicles to engage in risky investments, through the use of derivatives trading etc.	None
Many of such companies do, of course, involve in manipulation of the market, money laundering and also indulge in corrupt activities like round tripping, parking black money or offering, accepting etc., directly or indirectly bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof.	None
OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) in the year 1998 issued a report called Harmful Tax Competition An Emerging Global Issue.	None
The report advocated doing away with tax havens and offshore financial canters, like the Cayman Islands, on the basis that their lowtax regimes provide them with an unfair advantage in the global marketplace and are thus harmful to the economics of more developed countries.	None
OECD threatened to place the Cayman Islands and other tax havens on a black list and impose sanctions against them.	None
OECDs blacklist was avoided by Cayman Islands in May 2000 by committing itself to a string of reforms to improve transparency, remove discriminatory practices and began to exchange information with OECD.	None
Often, complaints have been raised stating that these centres are utilized for manipulating market, to launder money, to evade tax, to finance terrorism, indulge in corruption etc.	None
All the same, it is stated that OFCs have an important role in the international economy, offering advantages for multinational companies and individuals for investments and also for legitimate financial planning and risk management.	None
It is often said that insufficient legislation in the countries where they operate gives opportunities for money laundering, tax evasion etc.	None
and, hence, it is imperative that that Indian Parliament would address all these issues with utmost urgency.	None
Need for Legislation Tax avoidance is a problem faced by almost all countries following civil and common law systems and all share the common broad aim, that is to combat it.	None
Many countries are taking various legislative measures to increase the scrutiny of transactions conducted by nonresident enterprises.	None
Australia has both general and specific antiavoidance rule (GAAR) in its Income Tax Legislations.	None
In Australia, GAAR is in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, 1936, which is intended to provide an effective measure against tax avoidance arrangements.	None
South Africa has also taken initiative in combating impermissible tax avoidance or tax shelters.	None
Countries like China, Japan etc. have also taken remedial measures.	None
Direct Tax Code Bill (DTC) 2010, proposed in India, envisages creation of an economically efficient, effective direct tax system, proposing GAAR.	None
GAAR intends to prevent tax avoidance, what is inequitable and undesirable.	None
Clause 5(4)(g) provides that the income from transfer, outside India of a share in a foreign company shall be deemed to arise in if the FMV of assets India owned by the foreign company is at least 50 of its total assets.	None
Necessity to take effective legislative measures has been felt in this country, but we always lag behind because our priorities are different.	None
Lack of proper regulatory laws, leads to uncertainty and passing inconsistent orders by Courts, Tribunals and other forums, putting Revenue and tax payers at bay.	None
HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANY Companies Act in India and all over the world have statutorily recognised subsidiary company as a separate legal entity.	None
Section 2(47) of the Indian Companies Act 1956 defines subsidiary company or subsidiary, a subsidiary company within the meaning of Section 4 of the Act.	None
For the purpose of Indian Companies Act, a company shall be subject to the provisions of subsection 3 of Section 4, be deemed to be subsidiary of another, subject to certain conditions, which includes holding of share capital in excess of 50 controlling the composition of Board of Directors and gaining status of subsidiary with respect to third company by holding companys subsidization of third company.	None
A holding company is one which owns sufficient shares in the subsidiary company to determine who shall be its directors and how its affairs shall be conducted.	None
Position in India and elsewhere is that the holding company controls a number of subsidiaries and respective businesses of companies within the group and manage and integrate as whole as though they are merely departments of one large undertaking owned by the holding company.	None
But, the business of a subsidiary is not the business of the holding company (See Gramophone Typewriter Ltd. v. Stanley, (190810)	None
All ER Rep 833 at 837).	None
Subsidiary companies are, therefore, the integral part of corporate structure.	None
Activities of the companies over the years have grown enormously of its incorporation and outside and their structures have become more complex.	None
Multi National Companies having large volume of business nationally or internationally will have to depend upon their subsidiary companies in the national and international level for better returns for the investors and for the growth of the company.	None
When a holding company owns all of the voting stock of another company, the company is said to be a WOS of the parent company.	None
Holding companies and their subsidiaries can create pyramids, whereby subsidiary owns a controlling interest in another company, thus becoming its parent company.	None
Legal relationship between a holding company and WOS is that they are two distinct legal persons and the holding company does not own the assets of the subsidiary and, in law, the management of the business of the subsidiary also vests in its Board of Directors.	None
In Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT AIR 1955 SC 74, this Court held that shareholders only rights is to get dividend if and when the company declares it, to participate in the liquidation proceeds and to vote at the shareholders meeting.	None
Refer also to Carew and Company Ltd. v. Union of India (1975) 2 SCC 791 and Carrasco Investments Ltd. v. Special Director, Enforcement (1994) 79	None
Comp Case 631 (Delhi).	None
Holding company, of course, if the subsidiary is a WOS, may appoint or remove any director if it so desires by a resolution in the General Body Meeting of the subsidiary.	None
Holding companies and subsidiaries can be considered as single economic entity and consolidated balance sheet is the accounting relationship between the holding company and subsidiary company, which shows the status of the entire business enterprises.	None
Shares of stock in the subsidiary company are held as assets on the books of the parent company and can be issued as collateral for additional debt financing.	None
Holding company and subsidiary company are, however, considered as separate legal entities, and subsidiary are allowed decentralized management.	None
Each subsidiary can reform its own management personnel and holding company may also provide expert, efficient and competent services for the benefit of the subsidiaries.	None
U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Bestfoods 524 US 51 (1998) explained that it is a general principle of corporate law and legal systems that a parent corporation is not liable for the acts of its subsidiary, but the Court went on to explain that corporate veil can be pierced and the parent company can be held liable for the conduct of its subsidiary, if the corporal form is misused to accomplish certain wrongful purposes, when the parent company is directly a participant in the wrong complained of.	None
Mere ownership, parental control, management etc. of a subsidiary is not sufficient to pierce the status of their relationship and, to hold parent company liable.	None
In Adams v. Cape Industries Plc.	None
(1991) 1 All ER 929, the Court of Appeal emphasized that it is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil where special circumstances exist indicating that it is mere fagade concealing true facts.	None
Courts, however, will not allow the separate corporate entities to be used as a means to carry out fraud or to evade tax.	None
Parent company of a WOS, is not responsible, legally for the unlawful activities of the subsidiary save in exceptional circumstances, such as a company is a sham or the agent of the shareholder, the parent company is regarded as a shareholder.	None
MultiNational Companies, by setting up complex vertical pyramid like structures, would be able to distance themselves and separate the parent from operating companies, thereby protecting the multinational companies from legal liabilities.	None
SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT 62.	None
hareholders Agreement ( for short SHA) is essentially a contract between some or all other shareholders in a company, the purpose of which is to confer rights and impose obligations over and above those provided by the Company Law.	None
SHA is a private contract between the shareholders compared to Articles of Association of the Company, which is a public document.	None
Being a private document it binds parties thereof and not the other remaining shareholders in the company.	None
Advantage of SHA is that it gives greater flexibility, unlike Articles of Association.	None
It also makes provisions for resolution of any dispute between the shareholders and also how the future capital contributions have to be made.	None
Provisions of the SHA may also go contrary to the provisions of the Articles of Association, in that event, naturally provisions of the Articles of Association would govern and not the provisions made in the SHA.	None
The nature of SHA was considered by a two Judges Bench of this Court in V. B. Rangaraj v. V. B. Gopalakrishnan and Ors.	None
(1992) 1 SCC 160.	None
In that case, an agreement was entered into between shareholders of a private company wherein a restriction was imposed on a living member of the company to transfer his shares only to a member of his own branch of the family, such restrictions were, however, not envisaged or provided for within the Articles of Association.	None
This Court has taken the view that provisions of the Shareholders Agreement imposing restrictions even when consistent with Company legislation, are to be authorized only when they are incorporated in the Articles of Association, a view we do not subscribe.	None
This Court in Gherulal Parekh v. Mahadeo Das Maiya (1959) SCR Supp (2) 406 held that freedom of contract can be restricted by law only in cases where it is for some good for the community.	None
Companies Act 1956 or the FERA 1973, RBI Regulation or the I.T. Act do not explicitly or impliedly forbid shareholders of a company to enter into agreements as to how they should exercise voting rights attached to their shares.	None
Shareholders can enter into any agreement in the best interest of the company, but the only thing is that the provisions in the SHA shall not go contrary to the Articles of Association.	None
The essential purpose of the SHA is to make provisions for proper and effective internal management of the company.	None
It can visualize the best interest of the company on diverse issues and can also find different ways not only for the best interest of the shareholders, but also for the company as a whole.	None
In S. P. Jain v. Kalinga Cables Ltd. (1965) 2	None
SCR 720, this Court held that agreements between nonmembers and members of the Company will not bind the company, but there is nothing unlawful in entering into agreement for transferring of shares.	None
Of course, the manner in which such agreements are to be enforced in the case of breach is given in the general law between the company and the shareholders.	None
A breach of SHA which does not breach the Articles of Association is a valid corporate action but, as we have already indicated, the parties aggrieved can get remedies under the general law of the land for any breach of that agreement.	None
SHA also provides for matters such as restriction of transfer of shares i.e. Right of First Refusal (ROFR),	None
Right of First Offer (ROFO), DragAlong Rights (DARs) and TagAlong Rights (TARs), Preemption Rights, Call option, Put option, Subscription option etc. SHA in a characteristic Joint Venture Enterprise may regulate its affairs on the basis of various provisions enumerated above, because Joint Venture enterprise may deal with matters regulating the ownership and voting rights of shares in the company, control and manage the affairs of the company, and also may make provisions for resolution of disputes between the shareholders.	None
Many of the above mentioned provisions find a place in SHAs, FWAs, Term Sheet Agreement etc.	None
in the present case, hence, we may refer to some of those provisions.	None
Right of First Refusal (ROFR) ROFR permits its holders to claim the transfer of the subject of the right with a unilateral declaration of intent which can either be contractual or legal.	None
No statutory recognition has been given to that right either in the Indian Company Law or the Income Tax Laws.	None
Some foreign jurisdictions have made provisions regulating those rights by statutes.	None
Generally, ROFR is contractual and determined in an agreement.	None
ROFR clauses have contractual restrictions that give the holders the option to enter into commercial transactions with the owner on the basis of some specific terms before the owner may enter into the transactions with a third party.	None
Shareholders right to transfer the shares is not totally prevented, yet a shareholder is obliged to offer the shares first to the existing shareholders.	None
Consequently, the other shareholders will have the privilege over the third parties with regard to purchase of shares.	None
Tag Along Rights (TARs) TARs, a facet of ROFR, often refer to the power of a minority shareholder to sell their shares to the prospective buyer at the same price as any other shareholder would propose to sell.	None
In other words, if one shareholder wants to sell, he can do so only if the purchaser agrees to purchase the other shareholders, who wish to sell at the same price.	None
TAR often finds a place in the SHA which protects the interest of the minority shareholders.	None
Subscription Option Subscription option gives the beneficiary a right to demand issuance of allotment of shares of the target company.	None
It is for that reason that a subscription right is normally accompanied by ancillary provisions including an Exit clause where, if dilution crosses a particular level, the counter parties are given some kind of Exit option.	None
Call Option Call option is an arrangement often seen in Merger and Acquisition projects, especially when they aim at foreign investment.	None
A Call option is given to a foreign buyer by agreement so that the foreign buyer is able to enjoy the permitted minimum equity interests of the target company.	None
Call option is always granted as a right not an obligation, which can be exercised upon satisfaction of certain conditions and or within certain period agreed by the grantor and grantee.	None
The buyer of Call option pays for the right, without the obligation to buy some underlying instrument from the writer of the option contract at a set future date and at the strike price.	None
Call option is where the beneficiary of the action has a right to compel a counterparty to transfer his shares at a predetermined or price fixed in accordance with the predetermined maxim or even fair market value which results in a simple transfer of shares.	None
Put Option A put option represents the right, but not the requirement to sell a set number of shares of stock, which one do not yet own, at a predetermined strike price, before the option reaches the expiration date.	None
A put option is purchased with the belief that the underlying stock price will drop well before the strike price, at which point one may choose to exercise the option.	None
Cash and Cashless Options Cash and Cashless options are related arrangement to call and put options creating a route by which the investors could carry out their investment, in the event of an appreciation in the value of shares.	None
SHA, therefore, regulate the ownership and voting rights of shares in the company including ROFR, TARs, DARs, Preemption Rights, Call Options, Put Options, Subscription Option etc.	None
in relation to any shares issued by the company, restriction of transfer of shares or granting securities interest over shares, provision for minority protection, lockdown or for the interest of the shareholders and the company.	None
Provisions referred to above, which find place in a SHA, may regulate the rights between the parties which are purely contractual and those rights will have efficacy only in the course of ownership of shares by the parties.	None
SHARES, VOTING RIGHTS AND CONTROLLING INTERESTS Shares of any member in a company is a moveable property and can be transferred in the manner provided by the Articles of Association of the company.	None
Stocks and shares are specifically included in the definition of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.	None
A share represents a bundle of rights like right to (1) elect directors, (2) vote on resolution of the company, (3) enjoy the profits of the company if and when dividend is declared or distributed, (4) share in the surplus, if any, on liquidation.	None
Share is a right to a specified amount of the share capital of a company carrying out certain rights and liabilities, in other words, shares are bundles of intangible rights against the company.	None
Shares are to be regarded as situate in the country in which it is incorporated and register is kept.	None
Shares are transferable like any other moveable property under the Companies Act and the Transfer of Property Act.	None
Restriction of Transfer of Shares is valid, if contained in the Articles of Association of the company.	None
Shares are, therefore, presumed to be freely transferable and restrictions on their transfer are to be construed strictly.	None
Transfer of shares may result in a host of consequences.	None
Voting Rights Voting rights vest in persons who names appear in the Register of Members.	None
Right to vote cannot be decoupled from the share and an agreement to exercise voting rights in a desired manner, does not take away the right of vote, in fact, it is the shareholders right.	None
Voting rights cannot be denied by a company by its articles or otherwise to holders of shares below a minimum number such as only shareholders holding five or more shares are entitled to vote and so on, subject to certain limitations.	None
Rights and obligations flowing from voting rights have been the subject matter of several decisions of this Court.	None
In Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri v. Union of India (1950) 1	None
SCR 869 at 909 AIR 1951 SC 41, with regard to exercise of the right to vote, this Court held that the right to vote for the election of directors, the right to pass resolutions and the right to present a petition for winding up are personal rights flowing from the ownership of the share and cannot be themselves and apart from the share be acquired or disposed of or taken possession of.	None
In Dwarkadas Shrinivas of Bombay v. Sholapur Spinning Weaving Company (1954)	None
SCR 674 at 726 AIR 1954 SC 119, this Court noticed the principle laid down in Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri (supra).	None
Voting arrangements in SHAs or pooling agreements are not property.	None
Contracts that provide for voting in favour of or against a resolution or acting in support of another shareholder create only contractual obligations.	None
A contract that creates contractual rights thereby, the owner of the share (and the owner of the right to vote) agrees to vote in a particular manner does not decouple the right to vote from the share and assign it to another.	None
A contract that is entered into to provide voting in favour of or against the resolution or acting in support of another shareholder, as we have already noted, creates contractual obligation.	None
Entering into any such contract constitutes an assertion (and not an assignment) of the right to vote for the reason that by entering into the contract (a) the owner of the share asserts that he has a right to vote (b) he agrees that he is free to vote as per his will and (c) he contractually agrees that he will vote in a particular manner.	None
Once the owner of a share agrees to vote in a particular manner, that itself would not determine as a property.	None
Controlling Interest Shares, we have already indicated, represent congeries of rights and controlling interest is an incident of holding majority shares.	None
Control of a company vests in the voting powers of its shareholders.	None
Shareholders holding a controlling interest can determine the nature of the business, its management, enter into contract, borrow money, buy, sell or merge the company.	None
Shares in a company may be subject to premiums or discounts depending upon whether they represent controlling or minority interest.	None
Control, of course, confers value but the question as to whether one will pay a premium for controlling interest depends upon whether the potential buyer believes one can enhance the value of the company.	None
The House of Lords in IRC v. V.T. Bibby Sons (1946) 14 ITR (Supp) 7 at 910, after examining the meaning of the expressions control and interest, held that controlling interest did not depend upon the extent to which they had the power of controlling votes.	None
Principle that emerges is that where shares in large numbers are transferred, which result in shifting of controlling interest, it cannot be considered as two separate transactions namely transfer of shares and transfer of controlling interest.	None
Controlling interest forms an inalienable part of the share itself and the same cannot be traded separately unless otherwise provided by the Statute.	None
Of course, the Indian Company Law does not explicitly throw light on whether control or controlling interest is a part of or inextricably linked with a share of a company or otherwise, so also the Income Tax Act.	None
In the impugned judgment, the High Court has taken the stand that controlling interest and shares are distinct assets.	None
Control, in our view, is an interest arising from holding a particular number of shares and the same cannot be separately acquired or transferred.	None
Each share represents a vote in the management of the company and such a vote can be utilized to control the company.	None
Controlling interest, therefore, is not an identifiable or distinct capital asset independent of holding of shares and the nature of the transaction has to be ascertained from the terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances.	Reasoning
Controlling interest is inherently contractual right and not property right and cannot be considered as transfer of property and hence a capital asset unless the Statute stipulates otherwise.	None
Acquisition of shares may carry the acquisition of controlling interest, which is purely a commercial concept and tax is levied on the transaction, not on its effect.	None
LIFTING THE VEIL  TAX LAWS Lifting the corporate veil doctrine is readily applied in the cases coming within the Company Law, Law of Contract, Law of Taxation.	None
Once the transaction is shown to be fraudulent, sham, circuitous or a device designed to defeat the interests of the shareholders, investors, parties to the contract and also for tax evasion, the Court can always lift the corporate veil and examine the substance of the transaction.	None
This Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Sri Meenakshi Mills Ltd., Madurai, AIR 1967 SC 819 held that the Court is entitled to lift the veil of the corporate entity and pay regard to the economic realities behind the legal fagade meaning that the court has the power to disregard the corporate entity if it is used for tax evasion.	None
In Life Insurance Corporation of India v. Escorts Limited and Others (1986) 1 SCC 264, this Court held that the corporate veil may be lifted where a statute itself contemplates lifting of the veil or fraud or improper conduct intended to be prevented or a taxing statute or a beneficial statute is sought to be evaded or where associated companies are inextricably as to be, in reality part of one concern.	None
Lifting the Corporate Veil doctrine was also applied in Juggilal Kampalpat v. Commissioner of Income Tax, U.P. , AIR 1969 SC 932 (1969)	None
1	None
SCR 988, wherein this Court noticed that the assessee firm sought to avoid tax on the amount of compensation received for the loss of office by claiming that it was capital gain and it was found that the termination of the contract of managing agency was a collusive transaction.	None
Court held that it was a collusive device, practised by the managed company and the assessee firm for the purpose of evading income tax, both at the hands of the payer and the payee.	None
Lifting the corporate veil doctrine can, therefore, be applied in tax matters even in the absence of any statutory authorisation to that effect.	None
Principle is also being applied in cases of holding company  subsidiary relationship where in spite of being separate legal personalities, if the facts reveal that they indulge in dubious methods for tax evasion.	None
Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion Tax avoidance and tax evasion are two expressions which find no definition either in the Indian Companies Act, 1956 or the Income Tax Act, 1961.	None
But the expressions are being used in different contexts by our Courts as well as the Courts in England and various other countries, when a subject is sought to be taxed.	None
One of the earliest decisions which came up before the House of Lords in England demanding tax on a transaction by the Crown is Duke of Westminster (supra).	None
In that case, Duke of Westminster had made an arrangement that he would pay his gardener an annuity, in which case, a tax deduction could be claimed.	None
Wages of household services were not deductible expenses in computing the taxable income, therefore, Duke of Westminster was advised by the tax experts that if such an agreement was employed, Duke would get tax exemption.	None
Under the Tax Legislation then in force, if it was shown as gardeners wages, then the wages paid would not be deductible.	None
Inland Revenue contended that the form of the transaction was not acceptable to it and the Duke was taxed on the substance of the transaction, which was that payment of annuity was treated as a payment of salary or wages.	None
Crowns claim of substance doctrine was, however, rejected by the House of Lords.	None
Lord Tomlins celebrated words are quoted below Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be.	None
If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax.	None
This so called doctrine of the substance seems to me to be nothing more than an attempt to make a man pay notwithstanding that he has so ordered his affairs that the amount of tax sought from him is not legally claimable.	None
Lord Atkin, however, dissented and stated that the substance of the transaction was that what was being paid was remuneration.	None
The principles which have emerged from that judgment are as follows A legislation is to receive a strict or literal interpretation An arrangement is to be looked at not in by its economic or commercial substance but by its legal form and An arrangement is effective for tax purposes even if it has no business purpose and has been entered into to avoid tax.	None
The House of Lords, during 1980s, it seems, began to attach a purposive interpretation approach and gradually began to give emphasis on economic substance doctrine as a question of statutory interpretation.	None
In a most celebrated case in Ramsay (supra), the House of Lords considered this question again.	None
That was a case whereby the taxpayer entered into a circular series of transactions designed to produce a loss for tax purposes, but which together produced no commercial result.	None
Viewed that transaction as a whole, the series of transactions was selfcanceling, the taxpayer was in precisely the same commercial position at the end as at the beginning of the series of transactions.	None
House of Lords ruled that, notwithstanding the rule in Duke of Westminsters case, the series of transactions should be disregarded for tax purposes and the manufactured loss, therefore, was not available to the taxpayer.	None
Lord Wilberforce opined as follows While obliging the court to accept documents or transactions, found to be genuine, as such, it does not compel the court to look at a document or a transaction in blinkers, isolated from any context to which it properly belongs.	None
If it can be seen that a document or transaction was intended to have effect as part of a nexus or series of transactions, or as an ingredient of a wider transaction intended as a whole, there is nothing in the doctrine to prevent it being so regarded to do so in not to prefer form to substance, or substance to form.	None
It is the task of the court to ascertain the legal nature of any transaction to which it is sought to attach a tax or a tax consequence and if that emerges from a series or combination of transactions intended to operate as such, it is that series or combination which may be regarded.	None
(emphasis supplied) House of Lords, therefore, made the following important remarks concerning what action the Court should consider in cases that involve tax avoidance A taxpayer was only to be taxed if the Legislation clearly indicated that this was the case A taxpayer was entitled to manage his or her affairs so as to reduce tax Even if the purpose or object of a transaction was to avoid tax this did not invalidate a transaction unless an antiavoidance provision applied and If a document or transaction was genuine and not a sham in the traditional sense, the Court had to adhere to the form of the transaction following the Duke Westminster concept.	None
In Ramsay (supra) it may be noted, the taxpayer produced a profit that was liable to capital gains tax, but a readymade claim was set up to create an allowable loss that was purchased by the taxpayer with the intention of avoiding the capital gains tax.	None
Basically, the House of Lords, cautioned that the technique of tax avoidance might progress and technically improve and Courts are not obliged to be at a standstill.	None
In other words, the view expressed was that that a subject could be taxed only if there was a clear intendment and the intendment has to be ascertained on clear principles and the Courts would not approach the issue on a mere literal interpretation.	None
Ramsay was, therefore, seen as a new approach to artificial tax avoidance scheme.	None
Ramsay was followed by the House of Lords in another decision in IRC v. Burmah Oil Co Ltd. (1982)	None
54	None
TC 200.	None
This case was also concerned with a selfcancelling series of transactions.	None
Lord Diplock, in that case, confirmed the judicial view that a development of the jurisprudence was taking place, stating that Ramsay case marked a significant change in the approach adopted by the House of Lords to a preordained series of transactions.	None
Ramay and Burmah cases, it may be noted, were against selfcancelling artificial tax schemes which were widespread in England in 1970s.	None
Rather than striking down the selfcancelling transactions, of course, few of the speeches of Law Lords gave the impression that the tax effectiveness of a scheme should be judged by reference to its commercial substance rather than its legal form.	None
On this, of course, there was some conflict with the principle laid down in Duke of Westminster.	None
Duke of Westminster was concerned with the single tax avoidance step.	None
During 1970s, the Courts in England had to deal with several preplanned avoidance schemes containing a number of steps.	None
In fact, earlier in IRC v. Plummer (1979) 3	None
All ER 775, Lord Wilberforce commented about a scheme stating that the same was carried out with almost military precision which required the court to look at the scheme as a whole.	None
The scheme in question was a circular annuity plan, in which a charity made a capital payment to the taxpayer in consideration of his covenant to make annual payments of income over five years.	None
The House of Lords held that the scheme was valid.	None
Basically, the Ramsay was dealing with readymade schemes.	None
The House of Lords, however, had to deal with a non selfcancelling tax avoidance scheme in Dawson (supra).	None
Dawsons, in that case, held shares in two operating companies which agreed in principle in September 1971 to sell their entire shareholding to Wood Bastow Holdings Ltd.	None
Acting on advice, to escape capital gains tax, Dawsons decided not to sell directly to Wood Bastow, rather arranged to exchange their shares for shares in an investment company to be incorporated in the Isle of Man.	None
Greenjacket Investments Ltd. was then incorporated in the Isle of Man on 16.12.1971 and two arrangements were finalized (i) Greenjacket would purchase Dawsons shares in the operating company for 152,000 to be satisfied by the issue of shares of Greenjacket and (ii) an agreement for Greenjacket to sell the shares in the operating company to Wood Bastow for 152,000.	None
The High Court and the Court of Appeal ruled that Ramsay principle applied only where steps forming part of the scheme were selfcancelling and they considered that it did not allow share exchange and sale agreements to be distributed as steps in the scheme, because they had an enduring legal effect.	None
The House of Lords, however, held that steps inserted in a preordained series of transactions with no commercial purpose other than tax avoidance should be disregarded for tax purposes, notwithstanding that the inserted step (i.e. the introduction of Greenjacket) had a business effect.	None
Lord Brightman stated that inserted step had no business purpose apart from the deferment of tax, although it had a business effect.	None
Even though in Dawson, the House of Lords seems to strike down the transaction by the taxpayer for the purpose of tax avoidance, House of Lords in Craven (supra) clarified the position further.	None
In that case, the taxpayers exchanged their shares in a trading company (Q Ltd) for shares in an Isle of Man holding company (M Ltd), in anticipation of a potential sale or merger of the business.	None
Taxpayers, in the meanwhile, had abandoned negotiations with one interested party, and later concluded a sale of Q Ltds shares with another.	None
M Ltd subsequently loaned the entire sale proceeds to the taxpayers, who appealed against assessments to capital gains tax.	None
The House of Lords held in favour of the taxpayers, dismissing the crowns appeal by a majority of three to two.	None
House of Lords noticed that when the share exchange took place, there was no certainty that the shares in Q Ltd would be sold.	None
Lord Oliver, speaking for the majority, opined that Ramsay, Burmah and Dawson did not produce any legal principle that would nullify any transaction that has no intention besides tax avoidance and opined as follows My Lords, for my part I find myself unable to accept that Dawson either established or can properly be used to support a general proposition that any transaction which is effected for avoiding tax on a contemplated subsequent transaction and is therefore planned, is for that reason, necessarily to be treated as one with that subsequent transaction and as having no independent effect.	None
Craven made it clear that (1) Strategic tax planning undertaken for months or possible years before the event (ofsale) in anticipation of which it was effected (2) A series of transactions undertaken at the time of disposal sale, including an intermediate transaction interposed into having no independent life, could under Ramsay principle be looked at and treated as a composite whole transaction to which the fiscal results of the single composite whole are to be applied, i.e. that an intermediate transfer which was, at the time when it was effected, so closely interconnected with the ultimate disposition, could properly be described as not, in itself, a real transaction at all, but merely an element in some different and larger whole without independent effect.	None
Later, House of Lords in Ensign Tankers (Leasing) Ltd. v. Stokes (1992) 1 AC 655 made a review of the various tax avoidance cases from Floor v. Davis (1978) 2	None
All ER 1079 (1978)	None
Ch 295 to Craven (supra).	None
In Ensign Tankers, a company became a partner of a limited partnership that had acquired the right to produce the film Escape to Victory.	None
75 of the cost of making the film was financed by way of a nonrecourse loan from the production company, the company claimed the benefit of depreciation allowances based upon the full amount of the production cost.	None
The House of Lords disallowed the claim, but allowed depreciation calculated on 25 of the cost for which the limited partnership was at risk.	None
House of Lords examined the transaction as a whole and concluded that the limited partnership had only incurred capital expenditure on the provision of machinery or plant of 25 and no more.	None
Lord Goff explained the meaning of unacceptable tax avoidance in Ensign Tankers and held that unacceptable tax avoidance typically involves the creation of complex artificial structures by which, as though by the wave of a magic wand, the taxpayer conjures out of the air a loss, or a gain, or expenditure, or whatever it may be, which otherwise would never have existed.	None
This, of course, led to further debate as to what is unacceptable tax avoidance and acceptable tax avoidance.	None
House of Lords, later in Inland Revenue Commissioner v. McGuckian (1997) BTC 346 said that the substance of a transaction may be considered if it is a tax avoidance scheme.	None
Lord Steyn observed as follows While Lord Tomlins observations in the Duke of Westminster case 1936 A.C. 1 still point to a material consideration, namely the general liberty of the citizen to arrange his financial affairs as he thinks fit, they have ceased to be canonical as to the consequence of a tax avoidance scheme.	None
McGuckian was associated with a tax avoidance scheme.	None
The intention of the scheme was to convert the income from shares by way of dividend to a capital receipt.	None
Schemes intention was to make a capital receipt in addition to a tax dividend.	None
Mc.Guckian had affirmed the fiscal nullity doctrine from the approach of United Kingdom towards tax penalties which emerged from tax avoidance schemes.	None
The analysis of the transaction was under the principles laid down in Duke of Westminster, since the entire transaction was not a tax avoidance scheme.	None
House of Lords in MacNiven v. Westmoreland Investments Limited (2003) 1 AC 311 examined the scope of Ramsay principle approach and held that it was one of purposive construction.	None
In fact, Ramsays case and case of Duke of Westminister were reconciled by Lord Hoffmann in MacNiven.	None
Lord Hoffmann clarified stating as follows if the legal position is that tax is imposed by reference to a legally designed concept, such as stamp duty payable on a document which constitute conveyance or sale, the court cannot tax a transaction which uses no such document on the ground that it achieves the same economic effect.	None
On the other hand, the legal position is that the tax is imposed by reference to a commercial concept, then to have regard to the business substance of the matter is not to ignore the legal position but to give effect to it.	None
In other words, Lord Hoffmann reiterated that tax statutes must be interpreted in a purposive manner to achieve the intention of the Legislature.	None
Ramsay and Dawson are said to be examples of these fundamental principles.	None
Lord Hoffmann, therefore, stated that when Parliament intended to give a legal meaning to a statutory term or phrase, then Ramsay approach does not require or permit an examination of the commercial nature of the transaction, rather, it requires a consideration of the legal effect of what was done.	None
MacNiven approach has been reaffirmed by the House of Lord in Barclays Mercantile Business Finance Limited v. Mawson (2005)	None
AC 685 (HL).	None
In Mawson, BGE, an Irish Company had applied for a pipeline and it sold the pipeline to (BMBF) taxpayer for 91.3 Million.	None
BMBF later leased the pipeline back to BGE which granted a sublease onwards to its UK subsidiary.	None
BGE immediately deposited the sale proceeds as Barclays had no access to it for 31 years.	None
Parties had nothing to loose with the transaction designed to produce substantial tax deduction in UK and no other economic consequence of any significance.	None
Revenue denied BMBFs deduction for depreciation because the series of transactions amounted to a single composite transaction that did not fall within Section 24(1) of the Capital Cost Allowance Act, 1990.	None
House of Lords, in a unanimous decision held in favour of the tax payer and held as follows driving principle in Ramsays line of cases continues to involve a general rule of statutory interpretation and unblinked approach to the analysis of facts.	None
The ultimate question is whether the relevant statutory provisions, construed purposively, were intended to apply to a transaction, viewed realistically.	None
On the same day, House of Lords had an occasion to consider the Ramsay approach in Inland Revenue Commissioner v. Scottish Provident Institution (2004 1 WLR 3172).	None
The question involved in Scottish Provident Institution was whether there was a debt contract for the purpose of Section 150A(1) of the Finance Act, 1994.	None
House of Lords upheld the Ramsay principle and considered the series of transaction as a composite transaction and held that the composite transaction created no entitlement to securities and that there was, thus, no qualifying contract.	None
The line drawn by House of Lords between Mawson and Scottish Provident Institution in holding that in one case there was a composite transaction to which statute applied, while in the other there was not.	None
Lord Hoffmann later in an article Tax Avoidance reported in (2005)	None
BTR 197 commented on the judgment in BMBF as follows the primacy of the construction of the particular taxing provision and the illegitimacy of the rules of general application has been reaffirmed by the recent decision of the House in BMBF.	None
Indeed, it may be said that this case has killed off Ramsay doctrine as a special theory of revenue law and subsumed it within the general theory of the interpretation of statutes.	None
Above discussion would indicate that a clearcut distinction between tax avoidance and tax evasion is still to emerge in England and in the absence of any legislative guidelines, there bound to be uncertainty, but to say that the principle of Duke of Westminster has been exorcised in England is too tall a statement and not seen accepted even in England.	None
House of Lords in McGuckian and MacNiven, it may be noted, has emphasised that the Ramsay approach as a principle of statutory interpretation rather than an overarching anti avoidance doctrine imposed upon tax laws.	None
Ramsay approach ultimately concerned with the statutory interpretation of a tax avoidance scheme and the principles laid down in Duke of Westminster, it cannot be said, has been given a complete go by Ramsay,Dawson or other judgments of the House of Lords.	None
PARTIII INDOMAURITIUS TREATY  AZADI BACHAO ANDOLAN The Constitution Bench of this Court in McDowell (supra) examined at length the concept of tax evasion and tax avoidance in the light of the principles laid down by the House of Lords in several judgments like Duke of Westminster, Ramsay, Dawson etc.	None
The scope of IndoMauritius Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (in short DTAA), Circular No. 682 dated 30.3.1994 and Circular No. 789 dated 13.4.2000 issued by CBDT, later came up for consideration before a two Judges Bench of this Court in Azadi Bachao Andolan.	None
Learned Judges made some observations with regard to the opinion expressed by Justice Chinnappa Reddy in a Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in McDowell, which created some confusion with regard to the understanding of the Constitution Bench judgment, which needs clarification.	None
Let us, however, first examine the scope of the IndiaMauritius Treaty and its followup.	None
IndiaMauritius Treaty was executed on 1.4.1983 and notified on 16.12.1983.	None
Article 13 of the Treaty deals with the taxability of capital gains.	None
Article 13(4) covers the taxability of capital gains arising from the sale transfer of shares and stipulates that Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of any property other than those mentioned in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of that Article, shall be taxable only in that State.	None
Article 10 of the Treaty deals with the taxability of Dividends.	None
Article 10(1) specifies that Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of other contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.	None
Article 10(2) stipulates that such dividend may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident but if the recipient was the beneficial owner of the dividends, the tax should not exceed (a) 5 of the gross amount of the dividends if the recipient of the dividends holds at least 10 of the capital of the company paying the dividends and (b) 15 of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.	None
CBDT issued Circular No. 682 dated 30.03.1994 clarifying that capital gains derived by a resident of Mauritius by alienation of shares of an Indian company shall be taxable only in Mauritius according to Mauritius Tax Law.	None
In the year 2000, the Revenue authorities sought to deny the treaty benefits to some Mauritius resident companies pointing out that the beneficial ownership in those companies was outside Mauritius and thus the foremost purpose of investing in India via Mauritius was tax avoidance.	None
Tax authorities took the stand that Mauritius was merely being used as a conduit and thus sought to deny the treaty benefits despite the absence of a limitation of benefits (LOB) clause in the Treaty.	None
CBDT then issued Circular No. 789 dated 13.04.2000 stating that the Mauritius Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) issued by the Mauritius Tax Office was a sufficient evidence of tax response of that company in Mauritius and that such companies were entitled to claim treaty benefits.	None
Writ Petitions in public interest were filed before the Delhi High Court challenging the constitutional validity of the above mentioned circulars.	None
Delhi High Court quashed Circular No. 789 stating that inasmuch as the circular directs the Income Tax authorities to accept as a certificate of residence issued by the authorities of Mauritius as sufficient evidence as regards the status of resident and beneficial ownership, was ultra vires the powers of CBDT.	None
The Court also held that the Income Tax Office was entitled to lift the corporate veil in India to see whether a company was a resident of Mauritius or not and whether the company was paying income tax in Mauritius or not.	None
The Court also held that the Treaty Shopping by which the resident of a third country takes advantage of the provisions of the agreement was illegal and necessarily to be forbidden.	None
Union of India preferred appeal against the judgment of the Delhi High Court, before this Court.	None
This Court in Azadi Bachao Andolan allowed the appeal and Circular No. 789 was declared valid.	None
Limitation of Benefit Clause (LOB) India Mauritius Treaty does not contain any Limitation of Benefit (LOB) clause, similar to the IndoUS Treaty, wherein Article 24 stipulates that benefits will be available if 50 of the shares of a company are owned directly or indirectly by one or more individual residents of a controlling state.	None
LOB clause also finds a place in IndiaSingapore DTA.	None
Indo Mauritius Treaty does not restrict the benefit to companies whose shareholders are noncitizens residents of Mauritius, or where the beneficial interest is owned by noncitizens residents of Mauritius, in the event where there is no justification in prohibiting the residents of a third nation from incorporating companies in Mauritius and deriving benefit under the treaty.	None
No presumption can be drawn that the Union of India or the Tax Department is unaware that the quantum of both FDI and FII do not originate from Mauritius but from other global investors situate outside Mauritius.	None
Maurtius, it is well known is incapable of bringing FDI worth millions of dollars into India.	None
If the Union of India and Tax Department insist that the investment would directly come from Mauritius and Mauritius alone then the IndoMauritius treaty would be dead letter.	None
Mr. Aspi Chinoy, learned senior counsel contended that in the absence of LOB Clause in the India Mauritius Treaty, the scope of the treaty would be positive from Mauritius Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) createdspecifically to route investments into India, meets with our approval.	Arguments of Respondent
We acknowledge that on a subsequent sale transfer disinvestment of shares by the Mauritian company, after a reasonable time, the sale proceeds would be received by the Mauritius Company as the registered holder owner of such shares, such benefits could be sent back to the Foreign Principal/100 shareholder of Mauritius company either by way of a declaration of special dividend by Mauritius company and or by way of repayment of loans received by the Mauritius company from the Foreign Principal shareholder for the purpose of making the investment.	None
Mr. Chinoy is right in his contention that apart from DTAA, which provides for tax exemption in the case of capital gains received by a Mauritius company shareholder at the time of disinvestment exit and the fact that Mauritius does not levy tax on dividends declared and paid by a Mauritius company subsidiary to its Foreign Shareholders Principal, there is no other reason for this quantum of funds to be invested from through Mauritius.	None
We are, therefore, of the view that in the absence of LOB Clause and the presence of Circular No. 789 of 2000 and TRC certificate, on the residence and beneficial interest ownership, tax department cannot at the time of sale disinvestment exit from such FDI, deny benefits to such Mauritius companies of the Treaty by stating that FDI was only routed through a Mauritius company, by a company principal resident in a third country or the Mauritius company had received all its funds from a foreign principal company or the Mauritius subsidiary is controlled managed by the Foreign Principal or the Mauritius company had no assets or business other than holding the investment shares in the Indian company or the Foreign Principal/100 shareholder of Mauritius company had played a dominant role in deciding the time and price of the disinvestment sale transfer or the sale proceeds received by the Mauritius company had ultimately been paid over by it to the Foreign Principal its 100 shareholder either by way of Special Dividend or by way of repayment of loans received or the real owner beneficial owner of the shares was the foreign Principal Company.	None
Setting up of a WOS Mauritius subsidiary SPV by Principals genuine substantial long term FDI in India from through Mauritius, pursuant to the DTAA and Circular No. 789 can never be considered to be set up for tax evasion.	None
TRC whether conclusive LOB and look through provisions cannot be read into a tax treaty but the question may arise as to whether the TRC is so conclusive that the Tax Department cannot pierce the veil and look at the substance of the transaction.	None
DTAA and Circular No. 789 dated 13.4.2000, in our view, would not preclude the Income Tax Department from denying the tax treaty benefits, if it is established, on facts, that the Mauritius company has been interposed as the owner of the shares in India, at the time of disposal of the shares to a third party, solely with a view to avoid tax without any commercial substance.	None
Tax Department, in such a situation, notwithstanding the fact that the Mauritian company is required to be treated as the beneficial owner of the shares under Circular No. 789 and the Treaty is entitled to look at the entire transaction of sale as a whole and if it is established that the Mauritian company has been interposed as a device, it is open to the Tax Department to discard the device and take into consideration the real transaction between the parties , and the transaction may be subjected to tax.	None
In other words, TRC does not prevent enquiry into a tax fraud, for example, where an OCB is used by an Indian resident for roundtripping or any other illegal activities, nothing prevents the Revenue from looking into special agreements, contracts or arrangements made or effected by Indian resident or the role of the OCB in the entire transaction.	None
No court will recognise sham transaction or a colourable device or adoption of a dubious method to evade tax, but to say that the IndoMauritian Treaty will recognise FDI and FII only if it originates from Mauritius, not the investors from third countries, incorporating company in Mauritius, is pitching it too high, especially when statistics reveals that for the last decade the FDI in India was US 178 billion and, of this, 42 i.e. US 74.56 billion was through Mauritian route.	None
Presently, it is known, FII in India is Rs.450,000 crores, out of which Rs. 70,000 crores is from Mauritius.	None
Facts, therefore, clearly show that almost the entire FDI and FII made in India from Mauritius under DTAA does not originate from that country, but has been made by Mauritius Companies SPV, which are owned by companies individuals of third countries providing funds for making FDI by such companies individuals not from Mauritius, but from third countries.	None
Mauritius, and India, it is known, has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) laying down the rules for information, exchange between the two countries which provides for the two signatory authorities to assist each other in the detection of fraudulent market practices, including the insider dealing and market manipulation in the areas of securities transactions and derivative dealings.	None
The object and purpose of the MOU is to track down transactions tainted by fraud and financial crime, not to target the bona fide legitimate transactions.	None
Mauritius has also enacted stringent Know Your Clients (KYC) regulations and AntiMoney Laundering laws which seek to avoid abusive use of treaty.	None
Viewed in the above perspective, we also find no reason to import the abuse of rights doctrine (abus de droit) to India.	None
The above doctrine was seen applied by the Swiss Court in A Holding Aps.	None
(8 ITRL), unlike Courts following Common Law.	None
That was a case where a Danish company was interposed to hold all the shares in a Swiss Company and there was a clear finding of fact that it was interposed for the sole purpose of benefiting from the SwissDenmark DTA which had the effect of reducing a normal 35 withholding tax on dividend out of Switzerland down to 0.	None
Court in that case held that the only reason for the existence of the Danish company was to benefit from the zero withholding tax under the tax treaty.	None
On facts also, the above case will not apply to the case in hand.	None
Cayman Islands, it was contended, was a tax heaven and CGP was a shell company, hence, they have to be looked at with suspicion.	None
We may, therefore, briefly examine what those expressions mean and understood in the corporate world.	None
TAX HAVENS, TREATY SHOPPING AND SHELL COMPANIES Tax Havens is not seen defined or mentioned in the Tax Laws of this country Corporate world gives different meanings to that expression, so also the Tax Department.	None
The term tax havens is sometime described as a State with nil or moderate level of taxation and or liberal tax incentives for undertaking specific activities such as exporting.	None
The expression tax haven is also sometime used as a secrecy jurisdiction.	None
The term Shell Companies finds no definition in the tax laws and the term is used in its pejorative sense, namely as a company which exits only on paper, but in reality, they are investment companies.	None
Meaning of the expression Treaty Shopping was elaborately dealt with in Azadi Bachao Andolan and hence not repeated.	None
Tax Justice Network Project (U.K.), however, in its report published in September, 2005, stated as follows The role played by tax havens in encouraging and profiteering from tax avoidance, tax evasion and capital flight from developed and developing countries is a scandal of gigantic proportions.	None
The project recorded that one per cent of the worlds population holds more than 57 of total global worth and that approximately US 255 billion annually was involved in using offshore havens to escape taxation, an amount which would more than plug the financing gap to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of reducing the world poverty by 50 by 2015.	None
(Tax Us If You Can September 2005, 78 available at http www.taxjustice.net).	None
Necessity of proper legislation for charging those types of transactions have already been emphasised by us.	None
Round Tripping India is considered to be the most attractive investment destinations and, it is known, has received 37.763 billion in FDI and 29.048 billion in FII investment in the year to March 31, 2010.	None
FDI inflows it is reported were of 22.958 billion between April 2010 and January, 2042011 and FII investment were 31.031 billions.	None
Reports are afloat that million of rupees go out of the country only to be returned as FDI or FII.	None
Round Tripping can take many formats like underinvoicing and overinvoicing of exports and imports.	None
Round Tripping involves getting the money out of India, say Mauritius, and then come to India like FDI or FII.	None
Art. 4 of the IndoMauritius DTAA defines a resident to mean any person, who under the laws of the contracting State is liable to taxation therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of business or any other similar criteria.	None
An Indian Company, with the idea of tax evasion can also incorporate a company offshore, say in a Tax Haven, and then create a WOS in Mauritius and after obtaining a TRC may invest in India.	None
Large amounts, therefore, can be routed back to India using TRC as a defence, but once it is established that such an investment is black money or capital that is hidden, it is nothing but circular movement of capital known as Round Tripping then TRC can be ignored, since the transaction is fraudulent and against national interest.	None
Facts stated above are food for thought to the legislature and adequate legislative measures have to be taken to plug the loopholes, all the same, a genuine corporate structure set up for purely commercial purpose and indulging in genuine investment be recognized.	None
However, if the fraud is detected by the Court of Law, it can pierce the corporate structure since fraud unravels everything, even a statutory provision, if it is a stumbling block, because legislature never intents to guard fraud.	None
Certainly, in our view, TRC certificate though can be accepted as a conclusive evidence for accepting status of residents as well as beneficial ownership for applying the tax treaty, it can be ignored if the treaty is abused for the fraudulent purpose of evasion of tax.	None
McDowell  WHETHER CALLS FOR RECONSDIERATION McDowell has emphatically spoken on the principle of Tax Planning.	None
Justice Ranganath Mishra, on his and on behalf of three other Judges, after referring to the observations of Justice S.C. Shah in CIT v. A. Raman and Co. (1968) 1 SCC 10, CIT v. B. M. Kharwar (1969) 1 CR 651, the judgments in Bank of Chettinad Ltd. v. CIT (1940) 8 ITR 522 (PC), Jiyajeerao Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax and Excess Profits Tax, Bombay AIR 1959 SC 270 CIT v. Vadilal Lallubhai (1973) 3 SCC 17 and the views expressed by Viscount Simon in Latilla v. IRC.	None
26 TC 107 (1943)	None
AC 377 stated as follows Tax planning may be legitimate provided it is within the framework of law.	None
Colourable devices cannot be part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage or entertain the belief that is honourable to avoid the payment of tax by resorting to dubious methods.	None
It is the obligation of every citizen to pay the taxes honestly without resorting to subterfuges.	None
Justice Shah in Raman (supra) has stated that avoidance of tax liability by so arranging the commercial affairs that charge of tax is distributed is not prohibited and a tax payer may resort to a device to divert the income before it accrues or arises to him and the effectiveness of the device depends not upon considerations of morality, but on the operation of the Income Tax Act.	None
Justice Shah made the same observation in B.N. Kharwar (supra) as well and after quoting a passage from the judgment of the Privy Council stated as follows  The Taxing authority is entitled and is indeed bound to determine the true legal relation resulting from a transaction.	None
If the parties have chosen to conceal by a device the legal relation, it is open to the taxing authorities to unravel the device and to determine the true character of the relationship.	None
But the legal effect of a transaction cannot be displaced by probing into the substance of the transaction.	None
In Jiyajeerao (supra) also, this Court made the following observation Every person is entitled so to arrange his affairs as to avoid taxation, but the arrangement must be real and genuine and not a sham or makebelieve.	None
In Vadilal Lalubhai (supra) this Court reaffirmed the principle of strict interpretation of the charging provisions and also affirmed the decision of the Gujarat High Court in Sankarlal Balabhai v. ITO (1975) 100 ITR 97 (Guj.), which had drawn a distinction between the legitimate avoidance and tax evasion.	None
Lalitas case (supra) dealing with a tax avoidance scheme, has also expressly affirmed the principle that genuine arrangements would be permissible and may result in an assessee escaping tax.	None
Justice Chinnappa Reddy starts his concurring judgment in McDowell as follows While I entirely agree with my brother Ranganath Mishra, J. in the judgment proposed to be delivered by me, I wish to add a few paragraphs, particularly to supplement what he has said on the fashionable topic of tax avoidance.	None
(emphasis supplied)	None
Justice Reddy has, the above quoted portion shows, entirely agreed with Justice Mishra and has stated that he is only supplementing what Justice Mishra has spoken on tax avoidance.	None
Justice Reddy, while agreeing with Justice Mishra and the other three judges, has opined that in the very country of its birth, the principle of Westminster has been given a decent burial and in that country where the phrase tax avoidance originated the judicial attitude towards tax avoidance has changed and the Courts are now concerning themselves not merely with the genuineness of a transaction, but with the intended effect of it for fiscal purposes.	None
Justice Reddy also opined that no one can get away with the tax avoidance project with the mere statement that there is nothing illegal about it.	None
Justice Reddy has also opined that the ghost of Westminster (in the words of Lord Roskill) has been exorcised in England.	None
In our view, what transpired in England is not the ratio of McDowell and cannot be and remains merely an opinion or view.	None
Confusion arose (see Paragraph 46 of the judgment) when Justice Mishra has stated after referring to the concept of tax planning as follows On this aspect, one of us Chinnappa Reddy, J. has proposed a separate and detailed opinion with which we agree.	None
Justice Reddy, we have already indicated, himself has stated that he is entirely agreeing with Justice Mishra and has only supplemented what Justice Mishra has stated on Tax Avoidance, therefore, we have go by what Justice Mishra has spoken on tax avoidance.	None
Justice Reddy has depreciated the practice of setting up of Tax Avoidance Projects, in our view, rightly because the same is was the situation in England and Ramsay and other judgments had depreciated the Tax Avoidance Schemes.	None
In our view, the ratio of the judgment is what is spoken by Justice Mishra for himself and on behalf of three other judges, on which Justice Reddy has agreed.	None
Justice Reddy has clearly stated that he is only supplementing what Justice Mishra has said on Tax avoidance.	None
Justice Reddy has endorsed the view of Lord Roskill that the ghost of Westminster had been exorcised in England and that one should not allow its head rear over India.	None
If one scans through the various judgments of the House of Lords in England, which we have already done, one thing is clear that it has been a cornerstone of law, that a tax payer is enabled to arrange his affairs so as to reduce the liability of tax and the fact that the motive for a transaction is to avoid tax does not invalidate it unless a particular enactment so provides (Westminster Principle).	None
Needless to say if the arrangement is to be effective, it is essential that the transaction has some economic or commercial substance.	None
Lord Roskills view is not seen as the correct view so also Justice Reddys, for the reasons we have already explained in earlier part of this judgment.	None
A five Judges Bench judgment of this Court in Mathuram Agrawal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1999) 8 SCC 667, after referring to the judgment in B.C. Kharwar (supra) as well as the opinion expressed by Lord Roskill on Duke of Westminster stated that the subject is not to be taxed by inference or analogy, but only by the plain words of a statute applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.	None
Revenue cannot tax a subject without a statute to support and in the course we also acknowledge that every tax payer is entitled to arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible and that he is not bound to choose that pattern which will replenish the treasury.	None
Revenues stand that the ratio laid down in McDowell is contrary to what has been laid down in Azadi Bachao Andolan, in our view, is unsustainable and, therefore, calls for no reconsideration by a larger branch.	None
PARTIV CGP AND ITS INTERPOSITION CGPs interposition in the HTIL Corporate structure and its disposition, by way of transfer, for exit, was for a commercial or business purpose or with an ulterior motive for evading tax, is the next question.	Issue
Parties, it is trite, are free to choose whatever lawful arrangement which will suit their business and commercial purpose, but the true nature of the transaction can be ascertained only by looking into the legal arrangement actually entered into and carried out.	None
Indisputedly, that the contracts have to be read holistically to arrive at a conclusion as to the real nature of a transaction.	None
Revenues stand was that the CGP share was a mode or mechanism to achieve a transfer of control, so that the tax be imposed on the transfer of control not on transfer of the CGP share.	Arguments of Petitioner
Revenues stand, relying upon Dawson test, was that CGPs interposition in the Hutchison structure was an arrangement to deceive the Revenue with the object of hiding or rejecting the tax liability which otherwise would incur.	Arguments of Petitioner
119.	Arguments of Petitioner
Revenue contends that the entire corporate structure be looked at as on artificial tax avoidance scheme wherein CGP was introduced into the structure at the last moment, especially when another route was available for HTIL to transfer its controlling interest in HEL to Vodafone.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further it was pointed out that the original idea of the parties was to sell shares in HEL directly but at the last moment the parties changed their mind and adopted a different route since HTIL wanted to declare a special dividend out of US 11 million for payment and the same would not have been possible if they had adopted Mauritian route.	Arguments of Petitioner
120. Petitioner pointed out that if the motive of HTIL was only to save tax it had the option to sell the shares of Indian companies directly held Mauritius entities, especially when there is no LOB clause in IndiaMauritius Treaty.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it was pointed out that if the Mauritius companies had sold the shares of HEL, then Mauritius companies would have continued to be the subsidiary of HTIL, their account could have been consolidated in the hands of HTIL and HTIL would have accounted for the accounts exactly the same way that it had accounted for the accounts in HTIL BVI nominated payee.	Arguments of Petitioner
Had HTIL adopted the Mauritius route, then it would have been cumbersome to sell the shares of a host of Mauritian companies.	Arguments of Petitioner
CGP was incorporated in the year 1998 and the same became part of the Hutchison Corporate structure in the year 2005.	None
Facts would clearly indicate that the CGP held shares in Array and Hutchison Teleservices (India) Holdings Limited (MS), both incorporated in Mauritius.	None
HTIL, after acquiring the share of CGP (CI) in the year 1994 which constituted approximately 42 direct interest in HEL, had put in place various FWAs, SHAs for arranging its affairs so that it can also have interest in the functioning of HEL along with Indian partners.	None
Self centred operations in India were with 3GSPL an Indian company which held options through various FWAs entered into with Indian partners.	None
One of the tests to examine the genuineness of the structure is the timing test.	None
that is timing of the incorporation of the entities or transfer of shares etc.	None
Structures created for genuine business reasons are those which are generally created or acquired at the time when investment is made, at the time where further investments are being made at the time of consolidation etc.	None
HTIL preferred CGP route rather than adopting any other method (why?) for which we have to examine whether HTIL has got any justification for adopting this route, for sound commercial reasons or purely for evasion of tax.	None
In international investments, corporate structures are designed to enable a smooth transition which can be by way of divestment or dilution.	None
Once entry into the structure is honourable, exits from the structure can also be honourable.	None
HTIL structure was created over a period of time and this was consolidated in 2004 to provide a working model by which HTIL could make best use of its investments and exercise control over and strategically influence the affairs of HEL.	None
HTIL in its commercial wisdom noticed the disadvantage of preferring Array, which would have created problems for HTIL.	None
Hutchison Teleservices (India) Mauritius had a subsidiary, namely 3GSPL which carried on the call centre business in India and the transfer of CGP share would give control over 3GSPL, an indirect subsidiary which was incorporated in the year 1999.	None
It would also obviate problems arising on account of call and put options arrangements and voting rights enjoyed by 3GSPL.	None
If Array was transferred, the disadvantage was that HTIL had to deal with call and put options of 3GSPL.	None
In the above circumstances, HTIL in their commercial wisdom thought of transferring CGP share rather than going for any other alternatives.	None
Further 3GSPL was also a party to various agreements between itself and the companies of AS, AG and IDFC Group.	None
If Array had been transferred the disadvantage would be that the same would result in hiving off the call centre business from 3GSPL.	None
Consolidation operations of HEL were evidently done in the year 2005 not for tax purposes but for commercial reasons and the contention that CGP was inserted at a very late stage in order to bring a pretax entity or to create a transaction that would avoid tax, cannot be accepted.	None
The Revenue has no case that HTIL structure was a device or an artifice, but all along the contention was that CGP was interposed at the last moment and applying the Dawson test, it was contended that such an artificially interposed device be ignored, and applying Ramsay test of purposive interpretation, the transaction be taxed for gain.	None
CGP, it may be noted, was already part of the HTILs Corporate Structure and the decision taken to sell CGP (Share) so as to exit from the Indian Telecom Sector was not the fall out of a tax exploitation scheme, but a genuine commercial decision taking into consideration the best interest of the investors and the corporate entity.	None
Principle of Fiscal nullity was applied by Vinelott, J. in favour of the assessee in Dawson, where the judge rejected the contention of the Crown that the transaction was hit by the Ramsay principle, holding that a transaction cannot be disregarded and treated as fiscal nullity if it has enduring legal consequences.	None
Principle was again explained by Lord Brightman stating that the Ramsay test would apply not only where the steps are precontracted, but also they are preordained, if there is no contractual right and in all likelihood the steps would follow.	None
On Fiscal nullity, Lord Brightman again explained that there should be a preordained series of transactions and there should be steps inserted that have no commercial purpose and the inserted steps are to be disregarded for fiscal purpose and, in such situations, Court must then look at the end result, precisely how the end result will be taxed will depend on terms of the taxing statute sought to be applied.	None
Sale of CGP share, for exiting from the Indian Telecommunication Sector, in our view, cannot be considered as preordained transaction, with no commercial purpose, other than tax avoidance.	None
Sale of CGP share, in our view, was a genuine business transaction, not a fraudulent or dubious method to avoid capital gains tax.	None
SITUS OF CGP Situs of CGP share stands where, is the next question.	Issue
Law on situs of share has already been discussed by us in the earlier part of the judgment.	None
Situs of shares situates at the place where the company is incorporated and or the place where the share can be dealt with by way of transfer.	None
CGP share is registered in Cayman Island and materials placed before us would indicate that Cayman Island law, unlike other laws does not recognise the multiplicity of registers.	None
Section 184 of the Cayman Island Act provides that the company may be exempt if it gives to the Registrar, a declaration that operation of an exempted company will be conducted mainly outside the Island.	None
Section 193 of the Cayman Island Act expressly recognises that even exempted companies may, to a limited extent trade within the Islands.	None
Section 193 permits activities by way of trading which are incidental of off shore operations also all rights to enter into the contract etc.	None
The facts in this case as well as the provisions of the Caymen Island Act would clearly indicate that the CGP (CI) share situates in Caymen Island.	None
The legal principle on which situs of an asset, such as share of the company is determined, is well settled.	None
Reference may be made to the judgments in Brassard v. Smith 1925 AC 371, London and South American Investment Trust v. British Tobacco Co.	None
(Australia) 1927 1	None
Ch. 107.	None
Erie Beach Co. v. AttorneyGeneral for Ontario, 1930 AC 161 PC 10, R. v. Williams 1942 AC 541.	None
Situs of CGP share, therefore, situates in Cayman Islands and on transfer in Cayman Islands would not shift to India.	None
PARTV Sale of CGP, on facts, we have found was not the fall out of an artificial tax avoidance scheme or an artificial device, preordained, or preconceived with the sole object of tax avoidance, but was a genuine commercial decision to exit from the Indian Telecom Sector.	None
HTIL had the following controlling interest in HEL before its exit from the Indian Telecom Sector HTIL held its direct equity interest in HEL amounting approximately to 42 through eight Mauritius companies.	Arguments of Petitioner
HTIL indirect subsidiary CGP(M) held 37.25 of equity interest in TII, an Indian Company, which in turn held 12.96 equity interest in HEL.	None
CGP(M), as a result of its 37.25 interest in TII had an interest in several downstream companies which held interest in HEL, as a result of which HTIL obtained indirect equity interest of 7.24 in HEL.	Issue
HTIL held in Indian Company Omega Holdings, an Indian Co., interest to the extent of 45.79 of share capital through HTIM which held shareholding of 5.11 in HEL, resulting in holding of 2.34 interest in the Indian Company HEL.	Arguments of Petitioner
HTIL could, therefore, exercise its control over HEL, through the voting rights of its indirect subsidiary Array (Mauritius) which in turn controlled 42 shares through Mauritian Subsidiaries in HEL.	None
Mauritian subsidiaries controlled 42 voting rights in HEL and HTIL could not however exercise voting rights as stated above, in HEL directly but only through indirect subsidiary CGP(M) which in turn held equity interest in TII, an Indian company which held equity interest in HEL.	None
HTIL likewise through an indirect subsidiary HTI(M), which held equity interest in Omega an Indian company which held equity interest in HEL, could exercise only indirect voting rights in HEL.	None
HTIL, by holding CGP share, got control over its WOS Hutchison Tele Services (India) Holdings Ltd (MS).	None
HTSH(MS) was having control over its WOS 3GSPL, an Indian company which exercised voting rights in HEL.	None
HTIL, therefore, by holding CGP share, had 52 equity interest, direct 42 and approximately 10 (pro rata) indirect in HEL and not 67 as contended by the Revenue.	None
HTIL had 15 interest in HEL by virtue of FWAs, SHAs Call and Put Option Agreements and Subscription Agreements and not controlling interest as such in HEL.	None
HTIL, by virtue of those agreements, had the following interests Rights (and Options) by providing finance and guarantee to Asim Ghosh Group of companies to exercise control over TII and indirectly over HEL through TII Shareholders Agreement and the Centrino Framework Agreement dated 1.3.2006 Rights (and Options) by providing finance and guarantee to Analjit Singh Group of companies to exercise control over TII and indirectly over HEL through various TII shareholders agreements and the N.D. Callus Framework Agreement dated 1.3.2006.	None
Controlling rights over TII through the TII Shareholders Agreement in the form of rights to appoint two directors with veto power to promote its interest in HEL and thereby hold beneficial interest in 12.30 of the share capital of the in HEL.	None
Finance to SMMS to acquire shares in ITNL (formerly Omega) with right to acquire the share capital of Omega in future.	None
Rights over ITNL through the ITNL Shareholders Agreement, in the form of right to appoint two directors with veto power to promote its interests in HEL and thereby it held beneficial interest in 2.77 of the share capital of the Indian company HEL Interest in the form of loan of US231 million to HTI (BVI) which was assigned to Array Holdings Ltd. Interest in the form of loan of US 952 million through HTI (BVI) utilized for purchasing shares in the Indian company HEL by the 8 Mauritius companies Interest in the form of Preference share capital in JKF and TII to the extent of US 167.5 million and USD 337 million respectively.	None
These two companies hold 19.54 equity in HEL.	None
Right to do telecom business in India through joint venture Right to avail of the telecom licenses in India and right to do business in India	None
Right to use the Hutch brand in India Right to appoint remove directors in the board of the Indian company HEL and its other Indian subsidiaries Right to exercise control over the management and affairs of the business of the Indian company HEL (Management Rights)	None
Right to take part in all the investment, management and financial decisions of the Indian company HEL Right to control premium Right to consultancy support in the use of Oracle license for the Indian business Revenues stand before us was that the SPA on a commercial construction brought about an extinguishment of HTILs rights of management and control over HEL, resulting in transfer of capital asset in India.	None
Further, it was pointed out that the assets, rights and entitlements are property rights pertaining to HTIL and its subsidiaries and the transfer of CGP share would have no effect on the Telecom operations in India, but for the transfer of the above assets, rights and entitlements.	Arguments of Petitioner
SPA and other agreements, if examined, as a whole, according to the Revenue, leads to the conclusion that the substance of the transaction was the transfer of various property rights of HTIL in HEL to Vodafone attracting capital gains tax in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it was pointed out that moment CGP share was transferred offshore, HTILs right of control over HEL and its subsidiaries stood extinguished, thus leading to income indirectly earned, outside India through the medium of sale of the CGP share.	Arguments of Petitioner
All these issues have to be examined without forgetting the fact that we are dealing with a taxing statute and the Revenue has to bring home all its contentions within the four corners of taxing statute and not on assumptions and presumptions.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vodafone on acquisition of CGP share got controlling interest of 42 over HEL VEL through voting rights through eight Mauritian subsidiaries, the same was the position of HTIL as well.	None
On acquiring CGP share, CGP has become a direct subsidiary of Vodafone, but both are legally independent entities.	None
Vodafone does not own any assets of CGP.	None
Management and the business of CGP vests on the Board of Directors of CGP but of course, Vodafone could appoint or remove members of the Board of Directors of CGP.	None
On acquisition of CGP from HTIL , Array became an indirect subsidiary of Vodafone.	None
Array is also a separate legal entity managed by its own Board of Directors.	None
Share of CGP situates in Cayman Islands and that of Array in Mauritius.	None
Mauritian entities which hold 42 shares in HEL became the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Array, on Vodafone purchasing the CGP share.	None
Voting rights, controlling rights, right to manage etc., of Mauritian Companies vested in those companies.	None
HTIL has never sold nor Vodafone purchased any shares of either Array or the Mauritian subsidiaries, but only CGP, the share of which situates in Cayman Islands.	None
By purchasing the CGP share its situs will not shift either to Mauritius or to India, a legal issue, already explained by us.	None
Array being a WOS of CGP, CGP may appoint or remove any of its directors, if it wishes by a resolution in the general body of the subsidiary, but CGP, Array and all Mauritian entities are separate legal entities and have decentralised management and each of the Mauritian subsidiaries has its own management personnels.	None
Vodafone on purchase of CGP share got controlling interest in the Mauritian Companies and the incident of transfer of CGP share cannot be considered to be two distinct and separate transactions, one shifting of the share and another shifting of the controlling interest.	None
Transfer of CGP share automatically results in host of consequences including transfer of controlling interest and that controlling interest as such cannot be dissected from CGP share without legislative intervention.	None
Controlling interest of CGP over Array is an incident of holding majority shares and the control of Company vests in the voting power of its shareholders.	None
Mauritian entities being a WOS of Array, Array as a holding Company can influence the shareholders of various Mauritian Companies.	None
Holding Companies like CGP, Array, may exercise control over the subsidiaries, whether a WOS or otherwise by influencing the voting rights, nomination of members of the Board of Directors and so on.	None
On transfer of shares of the holding Company, the controlling interest may also pass on to the purchaser along with the shares.	None
Controlling interest might have percolated down the line to the operating companies but that controlling interest is inherently contractual and not a property right unless otherwise provided for in the statue.	None
Acquisition of shares, may carry the acquisition of controlling interest which is purely a commercial concept and the tax can be levied only on the transaction and not on its effect.	None
Consequently, on transfer of CGP share to Vodafone, Vodafone got control over eight Mauritian Companies which owned shares in VEL totalling to 42 and that does not mean that the situs of CGP share has shifted to India for the purpose of charging capital gains tax.	None
Vodafone could exercise only indirect voting rights in VEL through its indirect subsidiary CGP(M) which held equity interests in TII, an Indian Company, which held equity interests in VEL.	None
Similarly, Vodafone could exercise only indirect voting rights through HTI(M) which held equity interests in Omega, an Indian Company which in turn held equity interests in HEL.	None
On transfer of CGP share, Vodafone gets controlling interest in its indirect subsidiaries which are situated in Mauritius which have equity interests in TII and Omega, Indian Companies which are independent legal entities.	None
Controlling interest, which stood transferred to Vodafone from HTIL accompany the CGP share and cannot be dissected so as to be treated as transfer of controlling interest of Mauritian entities and then that of Indian entities and ultimately that of HEL.	None
Situs of CGP share, therefore, determines the transferability of the share and or interest which flows out of that share including controlling interest.	None
Ownership of shares, as already explained by us, carries other valuable rights like, right to receive dividend, right to transmit the shares, right to vote, right to act as per ones wish, or to vote in a particular manner etc and on transfer of shares those rights also sail along with them.	None
Vodafone, on purchase of CGP share got all those rights, and the price paid by Vodafone is for all those rights, in other words, control premium paid, not over and above the CGP share, but is the integral part of the price of the share.	None
On transfer of CGP share situated in Cayman Islands, the entire rights, which accompany stood transferred not in India, but offshore and the facts reveal that the offshore holdings and arrangements made by HTIL and Vodafone were for sound commercial and legitimate tax planning, not with the motive of evading tax.	None
Vodafone, on purchase of CGP share also got control over its WOS, HTSH(M) which is having control over its WOS, 3GSPL, an Indian Company which exercised voting rights in HEL.	None
3GSPL, was incorporated on 16.03.99 and run call centre business in India.	None
The advantage of transferring share of CGP rather than Array was that it would obviate the problems arising on account of the call and put agreements and voting rights enjoyed by 3GSPL.	None
3GSPL was also a party to various agreements between itself and Companies of AS, AG and IDFC Groups.	None
AS , AG IDFC have agreed to retain their shareholdings with full control including voting rights and dividend rights.	None
In fact, on 02.03.2007 AG wrote to HEL confirming that his indirect equity or beneficial interest in HEL worked out to be as 4.68 and it was stated, he was the beneficiary of full dividend rights attached to his shares and he had received credit support and primarily the liability for repayment was of his company.	None
Further, it was also pointed out that he was the exclusive beneficial owner of his shares in his companies, enjoying full and exclusive rights to vote and participate in any benefits accruing to those shares.	None
On 05.03.2007 AS also wrote to the Government on the same lines.	None
Vodafone, on acquisition of CGP, is in a position to replace the directors of holding company of 3GSPL so as to get control over 3GSPL.	None
3GSPL has call option as well as the obligation of the put option.	None
Rights and obligations which flow out of call and put options have already been explained by us in the earlier part of the judgment.	None
Call and put options are contractual rights and do not sound in property and hence they cannot be, in the absence of a statutory stipulation, considered as capital assets.	None
Even assuming so, they are in favour of 3GSPL and continue to be so even after entry of Vodafone.	None
We have extensively dealt with the terms of the various FWAs, SHAs and Term Sheets and in none of those Agreements HTIL or Vodafone figure as parties.	None
SHAs between Mauritian entities (which were shareholders of the Indian operating Companies) and other shareholders in some of the other operating companies in India held shares in HEL related to the management of the subsidiaries of AS, AG and IDFC and did not relate to the management of the affairs of HEL and HTIL was not a party to those agreements, and hence there was no question of assigning or relinquishing any right to Vodafone.	None
IDFC FWA of August 2006 also conferred upon 3 GSPL only call option rights and a right to nominate a buyer if investors decided to exit as long as the buyer paid a fair market value.	None
June 2007	None
Agreement became necessary because the composition of Indian investors changed with some Indian investors going out and other Indian investors coming in.	None
On June 2007, changes took place within the Group of Indian investors, in that SSKI and IDFC went out leaving IDF alone as the Indian investor.	None
Parties decided to keep June 2007 transaction to effectuate their intention within the broad contours of June 2006 FWA.	None
On 06.06.2007 FWA has also retained the rights and options in favour of 3GSPL but conferred no rights on Vodafone and Vodafone was only a confirming party to that Agreement.	None
Call and put options, we have already mentioned, were the subject matter of three FWAs viz., Centrino, N.D. Callus, IDFC and in Centrino and	None
N.D. Callus FWAs, neither HTIL was a party, nor was Vodafone.	None
HTIL was only a confirming party in IDFC FWA, so also Vodafone.	None
Since HTIL, and later Vodafone were not parties to those SHAs and FWAs, we fail to see how they are bound by the terms and conditions contained therein, so also the rights and obligations that flow out of them.	None
HTIL and Vodafone have, of course, had the interest to see the SHAs and FWAs, be put in proper place but that interest cannot be termed as property rights, attracting capital gains tax.	None
We have dealt with the legal effect of exercising call option, put option, tag along rights, ROFR, subscription rights and so on and all those rights and obligations we have indicated fall within the realm of contract between various shareholders and interested parties and in any view, are not binding on HTIL or Vodafone.	None
Rights (and options) by providing finance and guarantee to AG Group of Companies to exercise control over TII and indirectly over HEL through TII SHA and Centrino FWA dated 01.03.2006 were only contractual rights, as also the revised SHAs and FWAs entered into on the basis of SPA.	None
Rights (and options) by providing finance and guarantee to AS Group of Companies to exercise control over TII and indirectly over HEL through various TII SHAs and N.D. Callus FWA dated 01.03.2006 were also contractual rights, and continue to be so on entry of Vodafone.	None
Controlling right over TII through TII SHAs in the form of right to appoint two Directors with veto power to promote its interest in HEL and thereby held beneficial interest in 12.30 of share capital in the HEL are also contractual rights.	None
Finance to SMMS to acquire shares in ITNL (ultimately Omega) with right to acquire share capital of Omega were also contractual rights between the parties.	None
On transfer of CGP share to Vodafone corresponding rearrangement were made in the SHAs and FWAs and Term Sheet Agreements in which Vodafone was not a party.	None
SPA, through the transfer of CGP, indirectly conferred the benefit of put option from the transferee of CGP share to be enjoyed in the same manner as they were enjoyed by the transferor and the revised set of 2007 agreements were exactly between the parties that is the beneficiary of the put options remained with the downstream company 3 GSPL and the counterparty of the put option remained with AG AS Group Companies.	None
Fresh set of agreements of 2007 as already referred to were entered into between IDFC, AG, AS, 3 GSPL and Vodafone andin fact, those agreements were irrelevant for the transfer of CGP share.	None
FWAs with AG and AS did not constitute transaction documents or give rise to a transfer of an asset, so also the IDFC FWA.	None
All those FWAs contain some adjustments with regard to certain existing rights, however, the options, the extent of rights in relation to options, the price etc.	None
all continue to remain in place as they stood.	None
Even if they had not been so entered into, all those agreements would have remained in place because they were in favour of 3GSPL, subsidiary of CGP.	None
The High Court has reiterated the common law principle that the controlling interest is an incident of the ownership of the share of the company, something which flows out of holding of shares and, therefore, not an identifiable or distinct capital asset independent of the holding of shares, but at the same time speaks of change in the controlling interest of VEL, without there being any transfer of shares of VEL.	None
Further, the High Court failed to note on transfer of CGP share, there was only transfer of certain offshore loan transactions which is unconnected with underlying controlling interest in the Indian Operating Companies.	None
The other rights, interests and entitlements continue to remain with Indian Operating Companies and there is nothing to show they stood transferred in law.	None
The High Court has ignored the vital fact that as far as the put options are concerned there were preexisting agreements between the beneficiaries and counter parties and fresh agreements were also on similar lines.	None
Further, the High Court has ignored the fact that Term Sheet Agreement with Essar had nothing to do with the transfer of CGP, which was a separate transaction which came about on account of independent settlement between Essar and Hutch Group, for a separate consideration, unrelated to the consideration of CGP share.	None
The High Court committed an error in holding that there were some rights vested in HTIL under SHA dated 5.7.2003 which is also an agreement, conferring no right to any party and accordingly none could have been transferred.	None
The High Court has also committed an error in holding that some rights vested with HTIL under the agreement dated 01.08.2006, in fact, that agreement conferred right on Hutichison Telecommunication (India) Ltd., which is a Mauritian Company and not HTIL, the vendor of SPA.	None
The High court has also ignored the vital fact that FIPB had elaborately examined the nature of call and put option agreement rights and found no right in presenti has been transferred to Vodafone and that as and when rights are to be transferred by AG and AS Group Companies, it would specifically require Government permission since such a sale would attract capital gains, and may be independently taxable.	None
We may now examine whether the following rights and entitlements would also amount to capital assets attracting capital gains tax on transfer of CGP share.	None
Debts Loans through Intermediaries SPA contained provisions for assignment of loans either at Mauritius or Cayman Islands and all loans were assigned at the face value.	None
Clause 2.2 of the SPA stipulated that HTIL shall procure the assignment of and purchaser agrees to accept an assignment of loans free from encumbrances together with all rights attaching or accruing to them at completion.	None
Loans were defined in the SPA to mean, all intercompany loans owing by CGP and Array to a vendor group company including accrued or unpaid interest, if any, on the completion date.	None
HTIL warranted and undertook that, as on completion, loans set out in Part IV of Schedule 1 shall be the only indebtedness owing by the Wider group company to any member of the vendor group.	None
Vendor was obliged to procure that the loans set out in Part IV of Schedule 1 shall not be repaid on or before completion and further, that any loan in addition to those identified will be noninterest bearing.	None
Clause 7.4 of the SPA stipulated that any loans in addition to those identified in Part IV of Schedule 1 of the SPA would be noninterest bearing and on terms equivalent to the terms of those loans identified in Part IV of Schedule 1 of the SPA.	None
The sum of such indebtedness comprised of US 672,361,225 (Loan 1)  reflected in a Loan Agreement (effective date of loan 31 December 2006 date of Loan Agreement 28 April 2007)	None
HK 377,859,382.40 (Loan 2)  reflected in a Loan Agreement (effective date of Loan 31st December 2006 date of Loan Agreement 28 April 2007)	None
(i) (ii) US 1,050,220,607.40 US 231,111,427.41 (Loan 3)  reflected in a Receivable Novation Agreement i.e. HTM owed HTI BVI Finance such sum, which Array undertook to repay in pursuance of an intergroup loan restructuring, which was captured in such Receivable Novation Agreement dated 28 April 2007.	None
HTI BVI Finance Limited, Array and Vodafone entered into a Deed of Assignment on 08.05.2007 pertaining to the Array indebtedness.	None
On transfer of CGP shares, Array became a subsidiary of VIHBV.	None
The price was calculated on a gross asset basis (enterprise value of underlying assets), the intra group loans would have to be assigned at face value, since nothing was payable by VIHBV for the loans as they had already paid for the gross assets.	None
CGP had acknowledged indebtedness of HTI BVI Finance Limited in the sum of US161,064,952.84 as at the date of completion.	None
The sum of such indebtedness was comprised of US 132,092,447.14, reflected in a Loan Agreement (effective date of loan 31 December 2006 date of Loan Agreement 28 April 2007)	None
US 28,972,505.70, reflected in a Loan Agreement (effective date of loan 14 February 2007 date of Loan Agreement 15 February 2007).	None
HTI BVI Finance Limited Limited, CGP and the Purchaser entered into the Deed of Assignment on 08.05.2007 pertaining to the CGP indebtedness.	None
In respect of Array Loan No. 3 i.e. US 231,111,427.41, the right that was being assigned was not the right under a Loan Agreement, but the right to receive payment from Array pursuant to the terms of a Receiveable Novation Agreement dated 28.04.2007 between Array, HTIL and HTI BVI Finance Limited.	None
Under the terms of the Receiveable Novation Agreement, HTILs obligation to repay the loan was novated from HTI BVI Finance to Array, the consideration for this novation was US 231,111,427.41 payable by Array to HTI BVI Finance Limited.	None
It was this right to receive the amount from Array that was assigned to VHI BV under the relevant Loan Assignment.	None
It was envisaged that, between signing and completion of the agreement, there would be a further loan up to US 29.7 million between CGP (as borrower) from a Vendor Group Company (vide Clause 6.4 of the SPA) and the identity of the lender has not been identified in the SPA.	None
The details of the loan were ultimately as follows BorrowerLenderAmount ofDate ofEffective date LoanAgreementof Agreement CGPHTI (BVI)US28,972,505.7015 February14 February Finance Ltd.20072007 Array and CGP stood outside of obligation to repay an aggregate US 1,442,396.987.61 to HTI BVI Finance Limited and VHIBV became the creditor of Array and CGP in the place and stepped off a HTI BVI Finance Limited on 8.5.2007 when VHIBV stepped into the shoes of HTI BVI Finance Limited.	None
Agreements referred to above including the provisions for assignments in the SPA, indicate that all loan agreements and assignments of loans took place outside India at face value and, hence, there is no question of transfer of any capital assets out of those transactions in India, attracting capital gains tax.	None
Preference Shares Vodafone while determining bid price had taken into consideration, inter alia8 its ownership of redeemable preference shares in TII and JFK.	None
Right to preference shares or rights thereto cannot be termed as transfer in terms of Section 2(47) of the Act.	None
Any agreement with TII, Indian partners contemplated fresh investment, by subscribing to the preference shares were redeemable only by accumulated profit or by issue of fresh capital and hence any issue of fresh capital cannot be equated to the continuation of old preference shares or transfer thereof.	None
NON COMPETE AGREEMENT SPA contains a Non Compete Agreement which is a pure Contractual Agreement, a negative covenant, the purpose of which is only to see that the transferee does not immediately start a compete business.	None
At times an agreement provides that a particular amount to be paid towards noncompete undertaking, in sale consideration, which may be assessable as business income under Section 28(va) of the IT Act, which has nothing to do with the transfer of controlling interest.	None
However, a noncompete agreement as an adjunct to a share transfer, which is not for any consideration, cannot give rise to a taxable income.	None
In our view, a noncompete agreement entered into outside India would not give rise to a taxable event in India.	None
An agreement for a noncompete clause was executed offshore and, by no principle of law, can be termed as property so as to come within the meaning of capital gains taxable in India in the absence of any legislation.	None
HUTCH BRAND HTIL did not have any direct interest in the brand.	None
The facts would indicate that brand Intellectual Property Right were held by Hutchison Group Company based in Luxemburg.	None
SPA only assured Vodafone that they would not have to overnight cease the use of the Hutch brand name, which might have resulted in a disruption of operations in India.	None
The bare license to use a brand free of charge, is not itself a property and, in any view, if the right to property is created for the first time and that too free of charge, it cannot give rise to a chargeable income.	None
Under the SPA, a limited window of license was given and it was expressly made free of charge and, therefore, the assurance given by HTIL to Vodafone that the brand name would not cease overnight, cannot be described as property rights so as to consider it as a capital asset chargeable to tax in India.	None
ORACLE LICENSE Oracle License was an accounting license, the benefit of which was extended till such time VEL replaced it with its own accounting package.	None
There is nothing to show that this accounting package, which is a software, was transferred to Vodafone.	None
In any view, this license cannot be termed as a capital asset since it has never been transferred to the petitioner.	None
We, therefore, conclude that on transfer of CGP share, HTIL had transferred only 42 equity interest it had in HEL and approximately 10 (prorata) to Vodafone, the transfer was offshore, money was paid offshore, parties were noresidents and hence there was no transfer of a capital asset situated in India.	None
Loan agreements extended by virtue of transfer of CGP share were also offshore and hence cannot be termed to be a transfer of asset situated in India.	None
Rights and entitlements referred to also, in our view, cannot be termed as capital assets, attracting capital gains tax and even after transfer of CGP share, all those rights and entitlements remained as such, by virtue of various FWAs, SHAs, in which neither HTIL nor Vodafone was a party.	None
Revenue, however, wanted to bring in all those rights and entitlements within the ambit of Section 9(1)(i) on a liberal construction of that Section applying the principle of purposive interpretation and hence we may examine the scope of Section 9.	None
PART VI SECTION 9 AND ITS APPLICATION Shri Nariman, submitted that this Court should give a purposive construction to Section 9(1) of the Income Tax Act when read along with Section 5(2) of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Referring extensively to the various provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1922, and also Section 9(1)(i), Shri Nariman contended that the expression transfer in Section 2(47) read with Section 9 has to be understood as an inclusive definition comprising of both direct and indirect transfers so as to expand the scope of Section 9 of the Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Nariman also submitted that the object of Section 9 would be defeated if one gives undue weightage to the term situate in India, which is intended to tax a nonresident who has a source in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Nariman contended that the effect of SPA is not only to effect the transfer of a solitary share, but transfer of rights and entitlements which falls within the expression capital asset defined in Section 2(14) meaning property of any kind held by the assessee.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it was stated that the word property is also an expression of widest amplitude and would include anything capable of being raised including beneficial interest.	Arguments of Respondent
Further, it was also pointed out that the SPA extinguishes all the rights of HTIL in HEL and such extinguishment would fall under Section 2(47) of the Income Tax Act and hence, a capital asset.	Arguments of Respondent
157.	Arguments of Petitioner
Shri Harish Salve, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, submitted that Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act deals with taxation on income deemed to accrue or arise in India through the transfer of a capital asset situated in India and stressed that the source of income lies where the transaction is effected and not where the economic interest lies and pointed out that there is a distinction between a legal right and a contractual right.	Arguments of Petitioner
Referring to the definition of transfer in Section 2(47) of the Income Tax Act which provides for extinguishment, it was submitted, that the same is attracted for transfer of a legal right.	Arguments of Petitioner
Placing reliance on the judgment of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Grace Collins and thers, 248 ITR 323, learned senior counsel submitted that SPA has not relinquished any right of HTIL giving rise to capital gains tax in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
158.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. S.P. Chenoy, senior counsel, on our request, argued at length, on the scope and object of Section 9 of the Income Tax Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned senior counsel submitted that the first four clauses parts of Section 9(1)(i) deal with taxability of revenue receipts, income arising through or from holding an asset in India, income arising from the transfer of an asset situated in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. Chenoy submitted that only the last limb of Section 9(1)(i) deals with the transfer of a capital asset situated in India and can be taxed as a capital receipt.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned senior counsel submitted to apply Section 9(1)(i) the capital asset must situate in India and cannot by a process of interpretation or construction extend the meaning of that section to cover indirect transfers of capital assets properties situated in India.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned senior counsel pointed out that there are cases, where the assets shares situate in India are not transferred, but where the shares of foreign company holding owning such shares are transferred.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Mohan Parasaran, Additional Solicitor General, submitted that on a close analysis of the language employed in Section 9 and the various expressions used therein, would selfevidently demonstrate that Section 9 seeks to capture income arising directly or indirectly from direct or indirect transfer.	Arguments of Respondent
Shri Parasaran submitted, if a holding company incorporated offshore through a maze of subsidiaries, which are investment companies incorporated in various jurisdictions indirectly contacts a company in India and seeks to divest its interest, by the sale of shares or stocks, which are held by one of its upstream subsidiaries located in a foreign country to another foreign company and the foreign company step into the shoes of the holding company, then Section 9 would get attracted.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel submitted that it would be a case of indirect transfer and a case of income accruing indirectly in India and consequent to the sale of a share outside India, there would be a transfer or divestment or extinguishment of holding companys rights and interests, resulting in transfer of capital asset situated in India.	Arguments of Respondent
160.	None
Section 9 of the Income Tax Act deals with the incomes which shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India.	Reasoning
Under the general theory of nexus relevant for examining the territorial operation of the legislation, two principles that are generally accepted for imposition of tax are (a) Source and (b) Residence.	None
Section 5 of the Income Tax Act specifies the principle on which tax can be levied.	None
Section 5(1) prescribes residence as a primary basis for imposition of tax and makes the global income of the resident liable to tax.	None
Section 5(2) is the source based rule in relation to residents and is confined to income that has been received in India and income that has accrued or arisen in India or income that is deemed to accrue or arise in India.	None
In the case of Resident in India, the total income, according to the residential status is as under Any income which is received or deemed to be received in India in the relevant previous year by or on behalf of such person Any income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise in India during the relevant previous year and Any income which accrues or arises outside India during the relevant previous year.	None
In the case of Resident but not Ordinarily Resident in India, the principle is as follows Any income which is received or deemed to be received in India in the relevant previous year by or on behalf of such person Any income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise in India to him during the relevant previous year and Any income which accrues or arises to him outside India during the relevant previous year, if it is derived from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India.	None
In the case of NonResident, income from whatsoever source derived forms part of the total income.	None
It is as follows Any income which is received or is deemed to be received in India during the relevant previous year by or on behalf of such person and Any income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during the relevant previous year.	None
Section 9 of the Income Tax Act extends its provisions to certain incomes which are deemed to accrue or arise in India.	Reasoning
Four kinds of income which otherwise may not fall in Section 9, would be deemed to accrue or arise in India, which are (a) a business connection in India (b) a property in India (c) an establishment or source in India and (d) transfer of a capital asset in India.	None
Income deemed to accrue or arise in India Section 9	Reasoning
The following incomes shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India  all income accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, through or from any business connection in India, or through or from any property in India, or through orfrom any asset or source of income in India, or through the transfer of a capital asset situate in India.	None
Explanation 1  For the purposes of this clause  (a) in the case of a business of which all the operations are not carried out in India, the income of the business deemed under this clause to accrue or arise in India shall be only such part of the income as is reasonably attributable to the operations carried out in India (b) in the case of a nonresident, no income shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India to him through or from operations which are confined to the purchase of goods in India for the purpose of export (c) in the case of a nonresident, being a person engaged in the business of running a news agency or of publishing newspapers, magazines or journals, no income shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India to him through or from activities which are confined to the collection of news and views in India for transmission out of India (a) in the case of a nonresident, being  (1) an individual who is not a citizen of India or (2) a firm which does not have any partner who is a citizen of India who is resident in India or (3) a company which does not have any shareholder who is a citizen of India or who is resident in India.	None
The meaning that we have to give to the expressions either directly or indirectly, transfer, capital asset and situated in India is of prime importance so as to get a proper insight on the scope and ambit of Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act.	None
The word transfer has been defined in Section 2(47) of the Income Tax Act.	None
The relevant portion of the same is as under 2(47) Transfer, in relation to a capital asset, includes.	None
the sale, exchange or relinquishment of the asset or the extinguishment of any rights therein or the compulsory acquisition thereof under any law or in a case where the asset is converted by the owner thereof into, or is treated by him as, stockintrade of a business carried on by him, such conversion or treatment or	None

The term capital asset is also defined under Section 2(14) of the Income Tax Act, the relevant portion of which reads as follows 2(14)	None
Capital asset means property of any kind held by an assessee, whether or not connected with the business or profession, but does not include any stockintrade, consumable stores or raw materials held for the purposes of his business or profession	None
xxx	None
xxx	None
xxx	None
xxx	None
xxx xxx	None
The meaning of the words either directly or indirectly, when read textually and contextually, would indicate that they govern the words those precede them, namely the words all income accruing or arising.	None
The section provides that all income accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, would fall within the category of income that is deemed to accrue or arise in India.	None
Resultantly, it is only where factually it is established that there is either a business connection in India, or a property in India, or an asset or source in India or a capital asset in India, the transfer of which has taken place, the further question arises whether there is any income deeming to accrue in India from those situations.	None
In relation to the expression through or from a business connection in India, it must be established in the first instance that (a) there is a nonresident (b) who has a business connection in India and (c) income arises from this business connection.	None
Same is the situation in the case of income that arises through or from a property in India, i.e. (a) there must be, in the first instance, a property situated in India and (b) income must arise from such property.	None
Similarly, in the case of transfer of a capital asset in India, the following test has to be applied (a) there must be a capital asset situated in India, (b) the capital asset has to be transferred, and (c) the transfer of this asset must yield a gain.	None
The word situate, means to set, place, locate.	None
The words situate in India were added in Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act pursuant to the recommendations of the 12th Law Commission dated 26.9.1958.	None
Section 9 on a plain reading would show, it refers to a property that yields an income and that property should have the situs in India and it is the income that arises through or from that property which is taxable.	None
Section 9, therefore, covers only income arising from a transfer of a capital asset situated in India and it does not purport to cover income arising from the indirect transfer of capital asset in India.	Reasoning
SOURCE Revenue placed reliance on Source Test to contend that the transaction had a deep connection with India, i.e. ultimately to transfer control over HEL and hence the source of the gain to HTIL was India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Source in relation to an income has been construed to be where the transaction of sale takes place and not where the item of value, which was the subject of the transaction, was acquired or derived from.	None
HTIL and Vodafone are offshore companies and since the sale took place outside India, applying the source test, the source is also outside India, unless legislation ropes in such transactions.	None
Substantial territorial nexus between the income and the territory which seeks to tax that income, is of prime importance to levy tax.	None
Expression used in Section 9(1)(i) is source of income in India which implies that income arises from that source and there is no question of income arising indirectly from a source in India.	None
Expression used is source of income in India and not from a source in India.	None
Section 9 contains a deeming provision and in interpreting a provision creating a legal fiction, the Court is to ascertain for what purpose the fiction is created, but in construing the fiction it is not to be extended beyond the purpose for which it is created, or beyond the language of section by which it is created.	None

Power to impose tax is essentially a legislative function which finds in its expression Article 265 of the Constitution of India.	None
Article 265 states that no tax shall be levied except by authority of law.	None
Further, it is also well settled that the subject is not to be taxed without clear words for that purpose and also that every Act of Parliament must be read according to the natural construction of its words.	None
Viscount Simon quoted with approval a passage from Rowlatt, J. expressing the principle in the following words In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said.	None
There is no room for any intendment.	None
There is no equity about a tax.	None
There is no presumption as to tax.	None
Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied.	None
One can only look fairly at the language used.	None
Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC (1921) 1 KB 64, P. 71 (Rowlatt,J.)	None
In Ransom (Inspector of Tax) v. Higgs 1974 3 All ER 949 (HL), Lord Simon stated that it may seem hard that a cunningly advised taxpayer should be able to avoid what appears to be his equitable share of the general fiscal burden and cast it on the shoulders of his fellow citizens.	None
But for the Courts to try to stretch the law to meet hard cases (whether the hardship appears to bear on the individual taxpayer or on the general body of taxpayers as represented by the Inland Revenue) is not merely to make bad law but to run the risk of subverting the rule of law itself.	None
The proper course in construing revenue Acts is to give a fair and reasonable construction to their language without leaning to one side or the other but keeping in mind that no tax can be imposed without words clearly showing an intention to lay the burden and that equitable construction of the words is not permissible Ormond Investment Co. v. Betts (1928)	None
All ER Rep 709 (HL), a principle entrenched in our jurisprudence as well.	None
In Mathuram Aggarwal (supra), this Court relied on the judgment in Duke of Westminster and opined that the charging section has to be strictly construed.	None
An invitation to purposively construe Section 9 applying look through provision without legislative sanction, would be contrary to the ratio of Mathuram Aggarwal.	None
Section 9(1)(i) covers only income arising or accruing directly or indirectly or through the transfer of a capital asset situated in India.	Reasoning
Section 9(1)(i) cannot by a process of interpretation or construction be extended to cover indirect transfers of capital assets property situate in India.	Reasoning
On transfer of shares of a foreign company to a nonresident offshore, there is no transfer of shares of the Indian Company, though held by the foreign company, in such a case it cannot be contended that the transfer of shares of the foreign holding company, results in an extinguishment of the foreign company control of the Indian company and it also does not constitute an extinguishment and transfer of an asset situate in India.	None
Transfer of the foreign holding companys share offshore, cannot result in an extinguishment of the holding company right of control of the Indian company nor can it be stated that the same constitutes extinguishment and transfer of an asset management and control of property situated in India.	None
The Legislature wherever wanted to tax income which arises indirectly from the assets, the same has been specifically provided so.	None
For example, reference may be made to Section 64 of the Indian Income Tax Act, which says that in computing the total income of an individual, there shall be included all such income as arises directly or indirectly to the sons wife, of such individual, from assets transferred directly or indirectly on and after 1.6.73 to the sons wife by such individual otherwise than for adequate consideration.	None
The same was noticed by this Court in CIT v. Kothari (CM), (1964) 2	None
SCR 531.	None
Similar expression like from asset transfered directly or indirectly, we find in Sections 64(7) and (8) as well.	None
On a comparison of Section 64 and Section 9(1)(i) what is discernible is that the Legislature has not chosen to extend Section 9(1)(i) to indirect transfers.	None
Wherever indirect transfers are intended to be covered, the Legislature has expressly provided so.	None
The words either directly or indirectly, textually or contextually, cannot be construed to govern the words that follow, but must govern the words that precede them, namely the words all income accruing or arising.	None
The words directly or indirectly occurring in Section 9, therefore, relate to the relationship and connection between a nonresident assessee and the income and these words cannot and do not govern the relationship between the transaction that gave rise to income and the territory that seeks to tax the income.	None
In other words, when an assessee is sought to be taxed in relation to an income, it must be on the basis that it arises to that assessee directly or it may arise to the assessee indirectly.	None
In other words, for imposing tax, it must be shown that there is specific nexus between earning of the income and the territory which seeks to lay tax on that income.	None
Reference may also be made to the judgment of this Court in IshikawajmaHarima Heavy Industries Ltd. v. Director of Income Tax, Mumbai (2007) 3 SCC 481 and CIT v. R.D. Aggarwal (1965) 1	None
SCR 660.	None
Section 9 has no look through provision and such a provision cannot be brought through construction or interpretation of a word through in Section 9.	None
In any view, look through provision will not shift the situs of an asset from one country to another.	None
Shifting of situs can be done only by express legislation.	None
Federal Commission of Taxation v. Lamesa Holdings BV (LN)  (1998) 157 A.L.R. 290 gives an insight as to how look through provisions are enacted.	None
Section 9, in our view, has no inbuilt look through mechanism.	None
Capital gains are chargeable under Section 45 and their computation is to be in accordance with the provisions that follow Section 45 and there is no notion of indirect transfer in Section 45.	None
Section 9(1)(i), therefore, in our considered opinion, will not apply to the transaction in question or on the rights and entitlements, stated to have transferred, as a fall out of the sale of CGP share, since the Revenue has failed to establish both the tests, Resident Test as well the Source Test.	None
Vodafone, whether, could be proceeded against under Section 195(1) for not deducting tax at source and, alternatively, under Section 163 of the Income Tax Act as a representative assessee, is the next issue.	Issue
SECTION 195 AND OFFSHORE TRANSACTIONS Section 195 provides that any person responsible for making any payment to a nonresident which is chargeable to tax must deduct from such payment, the income tax at source.	None
Revenue contended that if a nonresident enters into a transaction giving rise to income chargeable to tax in India, the necessary nexus of such nonresident with India is established and the machinary provisions governing the collection of taxes in respect of such chargeable income will spring into operation.	None
Further, it is also the stand of the Revenue that the person, who is a nonresident, and not having a physical presence can be said to have a presence in India for the purpose of Section 195, if he owns or holds assets in India or is liable to pay income tax in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it is also the stand of the Revenue that once chargeability is established, no further requirements of nexus needs to be satisfied for attracting Section 195.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vodafone had presence in India, according to the Revenue at the time of the transaction because it was a Joint Venture (JV) Partner and held 10 equity interest in Bharti Airtel Limited, a listed company in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, out of that 10, 5.61 shares were held directly by Vodafone itself.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vodafone had also a right to vote as a shareholder of Bharati Airtel Limited and the right to appoint two directors on the Board of Directors of Bharti Airtel Limited.	Arguments of Petitioner
Consequently, it was stated that Vodafone had a presence by reason of being a JV Partner in HEL on completion of HELs acquisition.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vodafone had also entered into Term Sheet Agreement with Essar Group on 15.03.2007 to regulate the affairs of VEL which was restated by a fresh Term Sheet Agreement dated 24.08.2007, entered into with Essar Group and formed a JV Partnership in India.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, Vodafone itself applied for IFPB approval and was granted such approval on 07.05.2007.	Arguments of Petitioner
On perusal of the approval, according to the Revenue, it would be clear that Vodafone had a presence in India on the date on which it made the payment because of the approval to the transaction accorded by FIPB.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it was also pointed out that, in fact, Vodafone had presence in India, since by mid 1990, it had entered into a JV arrangement with RPG Group in the year 199495 providing cellular services in Madras, Madhya Pradesh circles.	Arguments of Petitioner
After parting with its stake in RPG Group, in the year 2003, Vodafone in October, 2005 became a 10 JV Partner in HEL.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it was pointed out that, in any view, Vodafone could be treated as a representative assessee of HTIL and hence, notice under Section 163 was validly issued to Vodafone.	Arguments of Petitioner
180.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vodafone has taken up a specific stand that tax presence has to be viewed in the context of the transaction that is subject to tax and not with reference to an entirely unrelated matter.	Arguments of Petitioner
Investment made by Vodafone group in Bharti Airtel would not make all entities of Vodafone group of companies subject to the Indian Law and jurisdiction of the Taxing Authorities.	Arguments of Petitioner
Presence, it was pointed out, be considered in the context of the transaction and not in a manner that brings a nonresident assessee under jurisdiction of Indian Tax Authorities.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it was stated that a tax presence might arise where a foreign company, on account of its business in India, becomes a resident in India through a permanent establishment or the transaction relates to the permanent establishment.	Arguments of Petitioner
Vodafone group of companies was a JV Partner in Bharti Airtel Limited which has absolutely no connection whatsoever with the present transaction.	None
The mere fact that the Vodafone group of companies had entered into some transactions with another company cannot be treated as its presence in a totally unconnected transaction.	None
To examine the rival stand taken up by Vodafone and the Revenue, on the interpretation of Section 195(1) it is necessary to examine the scope and ambit of Section 195(1) of the Income Tax Act and other related provisions.	None
For easy reference, we may extract Section 195(1) which reads as follows Section 195.	None
OTHER SUMS.	None
(1) Any person responsible for paying to a nonresident, not being a company, or to a foreign company, any interest or any other sum chargeable under the provisions of this Act (not being income chargeable under the head Salaries shall, at the time of credit of such income to the account of the payee or at the time of payment thereof in cash or by the issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct incometax thereon at the rates in force Provided that in the case of interest payable by the Government or a public sector bank within the meaning of clause (23D) of section 10 or a public financial institution within the meaning of that clause, deduction of tax shall be made only at the time of payment thereof in cash or by the issue of a cheque or draft or by any other mode Provided further that no such deduction shall be made in respect of any dividends referred to in section 115O. Explanation For the purposes of this section, where any interest or other sum as aforesaid is credited to any account, whether called Interest payable account or Suspense account or by any other name, in the books of account of the person liable to pay such income, such crediting shall be deemed to be credit of such income to the account of the payee and the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.	None
Section 195 finds a place in Chapter XVII of the Income Tax Act which deals with collection and recovery of tax.	None
Requirement to deduct tax is not limited to deduction and payment of tax.	None
It requires compliance with a host of statutory requirements like Section 203 which casts an obligation on the assessee to issue a certificate for the tax deducted, obligation to file return under Section 200(3), obligation to obtain tax deduction and collection number under Section 203A etc.	None
Tax deduction provisions enables the Revenue to collect taxes in advance before the final assessment, which is essentially meant to make tax collection easier.	None
The Income Tax Act also provides penalties for failure to deduct tax at source.	None
If a person fails to deduct tax, then under Section 201 of the Act, he can be treated as an assessee in default.	None
Section 271C stipulates a penalty on the amount of tax which has not been deducted.	None
Penalty of jail sentence can also be imposed under Section 276B.	None
Therefore, failure to deduct tax at source under Section 195 may attract various penal provisions.	None
Article 246 of the Constitution gives Parliament the authority to make laws which are extraterritorial in application.	None
Article 245(2) says that no law made by the Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have extra territorial operation.	None
Now the question is whether Section 195 has got extra territorial operations.	Issue
It is trite that laws made by a country are intended to be applicable to its own territory, but that presumption is not universal unless it is shown that the intention was to make the law applicable extra territorially.	None
We have to examine whether the presumption of territoriality holds good so far as Section 195 of the Income Tax Act is concerned and is there any reason to depart from that presumption.	None
A literal construction of the words any person responsible for paying as including nonresidents would lead to absurd consequences.	None
A reading of Sections 191A, 194B, 194C, 194D, 194E, 194I, 194J read with Sections 115BBA, 194I, 194J would show that the intention of the Parliament was first to apply Section 195 only to the residents who have a tax presence in India.	None
It is all the more so, since the person responsible has to comply with various statutory requirements such as compliance of Sections 200(3), 203 and 203A. The expression any person, in our view, looking at the context in which Section 195 has been placed, would mean any person who is a resident in India.	None
This view is also supported, if we look at similar situations in other countries, when tax was sought to be imposed on nonresidents.	None
One of the earliest rulings which paved the way for many, was the decision in Ex Parte Blain In re Sawers (1879)	None
LR 12 ChD 522 at 526, wherein the Court stated that if a foreigner remain abroad, if he has never come into this country at all, it seems impossible to imagine that the English Legislature could ever have intended to make such a person subject to particular English Legislation.	None
In Clark (Inspector of Taxes) v. Oceanic Contractors Inc. (1983) 1 ALL ER 133, the House of Lords had to consider the question whether chargeability has ipso facto sufficient nexus to attract TDS provisions.	None
A TDS provision for payment made outside England was not given extra territorial application based on the principle of statutory interpretation.	None
Lord Scarman, Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill held so on behalf of the majority and Lord Edmond Davies and Lord Lowry in dissent.	None
Lord Scarman said unless the contrary is expressly enacted or so plainly implied as to make it the duty of an English court to give effect to it, United Kingdom Legislation is applicable only to British subjects or to foreigners who by coming into this country, whether for a long or short time, have made themselves during that time subject to English jurisdiction.	None
The above principle was followed in Agassi v. Robinson 2006 1 WLR 2126.	None
This Court in CIT v. Eli Lilly and Company (India) P. Ltd. (2009) 15 SCC 1 had occasion to consider the scope of Sections 192, 195 etc.	None
That was a case where Eli Lilly Netherlands seconded expatriates to work in India for an Indiaincorporated joint venture (JV) between Eli Lilly Netherlands and another Indian Company.	None
The expatriates rendered services only to the JV and received a portion of their salary from the JV.	None
The JV withheld taxes on the salary actually paid in India.	None
However, the salary costs paid by Eli Lilly Netherlands were not borne by the JV and that portion of the income was not subject to withholding tax by Eli Lilly or the overseas entity.	None
In that case, this Court held that the chargeability under Section 9 would constitute sufficient nexus on the basis of which any payment made to nonresidents as salaries would come under the scanner of Section 192.	None
But the Court had no occasion to consider a situation where salaries were paid by nonresidents to another nonresident.	None
Eli Lilly was a part of the JV and services were rendered in India for the JV.	None
In our view, the ruling in that case is of no assistance to the facts of the present case since, here, both parties were nonresidents and payment was also made offshore, unlike the facts in Eli Lilly where the services were rendered in India and received a portion of their salary from JV situated in India.	None
In the instant case, indisputedly, CGP share was transferred offshore.	None
Both the companies were incorporated not in India but offshore.	None
Both the companies have no income or fiscal assets in India, leave aside the question of transferring, those fiscal assets in India.	None
Tax presence has to be viewed in the context of transaction in question and not with reference to an entirely unrelated transaction.	Reasoning
Section 195, in our view, would apply only if payments made from a resident to another nonresident and not between two nonresidents situated outside India.	None
In the present case, the transaction was between two nonresident entities through a contract executed outside India.	None
Consideration was also passed outside India.	None
That transaction has no nexus with the underlying assets in India.	None
In order to establish a nexus, the legal nature of the transaction has to be examined and not the indirect transfer of rights and entitlements in India.	None
Consequently, Vodafone is not legally obliged to respond to Section 163 notice which relates to the treatment of a purchaser of an asset as a representative assessee.	None
PARTVIII CONCLUSION I, therefore, find it difficult to agree with the conclusions arrived at by the High Court that the sale of CGP share by HTIL to Vodafone would amount to transfer of a capital asset within the meaning of Section 2(14) of the Indian Income Tax Act and the rights and entitlements flow from FWAs, SHAs, Term Sheet, loan assignments, brand license etc. form integral part of CGP share attracting capital gains tax.	None
Consequently, the demand of nearly Rs.12,000 crores by way of capital gains tax, in my view, would amount to imposing capital punishment for cpital investment since it lacks authority of law and, therefore, stands quashed and I also concur with all the other directions given in the judgment delivered by the Lord Chief Justice.	None
