Issue
ONGC and the Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai are, thus, in appeal before us.	Issue

The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the ONGC would raise three contentions in support of these appeals.	None
The value of services, which are rendered under a pure service contract cannot be subjected to customs duties on the ground that the results of seismic surveys are recorded in tapes or discs and, thus, would not be goods within the meaning of provisions of Customs Act, 1962.(ii)	Arguments of Petitioner
The exemption notifications having been issued for exemption of goods imported in India for petroleum exploration subject, of course, to filing of the essentiality certificate issued by the Directorate of Hydrocarbons and as such an essentiality certificate had been produced even before this Court, it is entitled to such exemption.(iii)	Arguments of Petitioner
In any event, having regard to the fact that the Tribunal accepted such essentiality certificate in the case of Tullow, there is no reason why the same benefit would not be granted in its favour.	Arguments of Petitioner
In any event, as the tapes and discs are softwares within the meaning of Serial No. 231 of the Notification, it is entitled to the benefit of the aforementioned exemption Notification No. 20 of 1989 having regard to the fact that the same has liberally been construed in terms of the explanation appended thereto.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. V. Lakshmikumaran, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of Tullow relied upon a public notice issued by the Madras Custom House and would submit on the basis thereof, which reads as under The following clarifications are hereby notified for information of importers, Clearing Agents and others concernedSl.	Arguments of Respondent
No.SubjectClarification7.Applicability of various certificates required under different notifications issued after the date of importationIf the substantive Clauses of a notification are fulfilled by an importer, concessional assessment should not be denied on the ground of time factor.	Arguments of Respondent
Relying on or on the basis of said public notice, it was submitted that on the same reasoning production of the essentiality certificate even at a later stage could serve the purpose.	Arguments of Respondent
Mr. A.K. Ganguly, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Commissioner of Customs (Imports), Mumbai, on the other hand, submitted that the exemption notifications are required to be construed very strictly and in view of the fact that a condition precedent has been attached thereto, namely, production of essentiality certificate at the time of importation, triggering event cannot be shifted to a later date.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was submitted that if it be held that production of such certificate at any point of time is considered to be sufficient compliance for the purpose of obtaining benefit under the said exemption notification, the same will have to be read in the manner that it was not necessary to be produced at the time of importation.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even if such a construction is possible, the learned Counsel would contend that the same should be produced only within a reasonable time, particularly, in view of the fact that the exemption notification was valid for one year.20.	Arguments of Petitioner
As regard public notice issued by the Madras Customs House, the learned Counsel urged that one issued by a particular Customs House cannot be equated with the circular issued by the Board in exercise of its statutory power under Section 151A of the Customs Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
The exemption notification being a statutory one cannot be clarified by one customs house as the same must emanate from a notification issued by some authority.21.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Ganguly argued that the Customs Act makes a difference between the certificates which are conditions precedent and those which are conditions subsequent as would appear from Section 18 of the Act.	Arguments of Petitioner
Reliance in this behalf has been placed on Jindal Drilling and Indus.	Arguments of Petitioner
Ltd. v. Collector of Customs, Bombay, 2001 (138) ELT 1335.	Arguments of Petitioner
Our attention has been drawn to an order of this Court dated 11.5.2000 passed by this Court dismissing the SLP (Civil) CC No. 3364 of 2000 filed thereagainst by	Arguments of Petitioner
Modest Shipping Agency Pvt. Ltd. reported in 2002 (140) ELT A 95.22.	Arguments of Petitioner
It was further urged that the public notice issued by the Madras Customs House refers to certificates which may be necessary to be produced within the meaning of the provisions of the Customs Act as, for example, certificate to prove country of origin or certificate to prove valuation, as may be necessary, by reason of the conditions imposed for import which are not conditions precedent or exemption notification.	Arguments of Petitioner
Both the importers are licensees.	None
Indisputably, they were entitled to the benefit of the exemption notification subject, of course, to the condition that they would produce the essentiality certificate granted by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons at the time of importation of goods.	None
Grant of essentiality certificate was not in the hands of the assessees.	None
It was a function of a department of the Central Government.	None
The essentiality certificate admittedly was not granted by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons within a reasonable time.	None
The importers could not be blamed therefor.	None
It is possible that delay in granting the said essentiality certificate was by way of default on the part of the authorities concerned.	None
The essentiality certificate granted in favour of ONGC refers to the notification, the relevant certificate number of the table, list 11 and condition number 34 or 36, as the case may be, of the notification.	None
It even refers to the serial number of the consignments.	None
The serial number of the tapes had also been mentioned therein.	None
Except for the purpose of grant of benefits under the said exemption notification, the said essentiality certificate would not serve any other purpose whatsoever.	None
Construction of an eligibility clause contained in an exemption notification depends inter alia upon the purpose for which an exemption is sought to be granted.	None
The exemption notification was issued by the Central Government in exercise of its power conferred upon it under Subsection (1) of Section 25 of the Customs Act.	None
An exemption thereunder is granted, if the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary so to do in public interest.	None
Such exemption can be granted either absolutely or subject to such conditions, as may be specified therein.	None
Such conditions are required to be fulfilled before or after clearance as may be specified.	None
Such exemption would be in relation to the goods of specified description from the whole or any part of duty or customs leviable thereon.	None
Serial Nos. 182 and 184 of the notification refer to the goods falling under Chapter 84 and specified in List 11 required in connection with petroleum operations undertaken by a licensee.	None
ONGC is a licensee for exploration of petroleum products.	None
ONGC has specifically been mentioned at Serial No. 182 of the said notification.	None
It is not in dispute that importation, if any, has been made in connection with petroleum operations to be undertaken under petroleum exploration licences granted by the Government of India on nomination basis.	None
The benefit of exemption notification would inter alia be available to the licensee if it is shown in terms of a certificate granted by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that the imported goods are required for petroleum operation referred to in Clause (a) of Condition No. 34 and under the licence referred to herein.	None
The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons is under the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of the Government of India.	None
The functions performed by it are public functions.	None
The notification never contemplated that a public functionary, having regard to the importance of the subject matter and in particular when such importations are being made in public interest, would not dispose of the application for grant of essentiality certificate within a reasonable time so as to enable the importer to avail the benefit thereof.	None
Applicants for grant of such certificates, having regard to their importance, should have been processed by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons as expeditiously as possible but they did not choose to do so probably having regard to the fact that no time schedule therefor was prescribed.	None
It is trite that when a public functionary is required to discharge its public functions within a time specified therefor, the same would be construed to be directory in nature.	None
See P.T. Rajan v. T.P.M. Sahir and Others, VI (2003) SLT 144IV (2003) CLT 168 (SC)(2003) 8 SCC 498 and Punjab State Electricity Board Ltd. v. Zora Singh and Others, VI (2005)	None
SLT 243III (2005) CLT 177 (SC)(2005) 6 SCC 776 .	None
Both the Customs Department and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas are departments of the Central Government.	Reasoning
The substantive provisions which were required to be complied with for the purpose of obtaining the benefits under the said exemption notification have indisputably been complied with.	Reasoning
It is not the case of the department that the assesse has anything to do with the grant of certificate except to pursue the matter to the best of its abilities.	Reasoning
It is not in dispute that the importers were, but for production of the certificate, otherwise entitled to the grant of benefit in terms of the said notification.30.	Reasoning
The conditions referred to in Subsection (1) of Section 25 as regard time when such certificate is to be produced would, thus, mean those which were within the control and power of the importer.	Reasoning
If it is not within the power and control of the importer and depends upon the acts of other public functionaries, noncompliance of such condition, subject to just exception cannot be held to be a condition precedent which would disable it from obtaining the benefit therefrom for all times to come.31.	Reasoning
It is no doubt true that the fiscal liability has to be certain.	Reasoning
There cannot, however, be any doubt that in a case of this nature ONGC being a Government company for all intent and purport was also certain that it would get the requisite exemption, subject of course, to its fulfilling the condition of obtaining such essentiality certificate.32.	Reasoning
There is no universal law, as was suggested by Mr. Ganguly, that fiscal liability cannot be deferred.	Reasoning
In a statute where there is a provision for a provisional assessment and or provisional clearance, subject to compliance of certain conditions, such conditions may be fulfilled at a later stage, namely, at the stage of final clearance or final assessment.33.	Reasoning
The question may be considered from another angle.	Reasoning
The Directorate General of Hydrocarbons was indisputably aware about the existence of such exemption notification.	Reasoning
The certificate in accordance with law has not only been granted, the same expressly refers to the exemption notification, the entry of the table, the relevant clauses applicable therefor also the bills of entries dated 22.5.1999 and 22.6.1999.	Reasoning
Indisputably, therefore, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons was aware of all requisite requirements necessary therefor.	Reasoning
It may presume that the department was also aware of the provisions of the Customs Act and the consequences likely to be suffered by the importer in the event of its inability to produce the same before the Competent Authority at the time of importation.	Reasoning
The exercise undertaken by the said department, thus, was not to end in futility.	Reasoning
In almost a similar situation, the question came up before this Court in Commissioner of Central Excise v. M.P.V. Engg.	None
Industries, III (2003)	None
SLT 6302003 (153) ELT 485 , (wherein one of us, B.P. Singh, J. was a member) which was answered stating that an assessee although was otherwise entitled to obtain the benefit of an exemption certificate, the same should not ordinarily be denied to it because of any administrative delay over which he had no say in the following words In a case of this nature it is only reasonable to take the view that the benefit of exemption will accrue to a unit found to be a smallscale industrial unit from the date on which the application was made for the grant of registration certificate.	None
Such a unit should not be deprived of the benefit to which it is otherwise entitled as a smallscale industrial unit merely because the authorities concerned took their own time in disposing of the application.	None
We, therefore, agree with the majority view of the Tribunal and hold that the benefit of exemption under the notification in question should be extended to the respondent with effect from the date on which the application for grant of registration was made by it before the Competent Authority.	None
The essentiality certificate, thus, must be treated to be a proof of the fact that the importers have fulfilled the conditions enabling them to obtain the benefit under the exemption notification.36.	Reasoning
The principles as regard construction of an exemption notification are no longer res integra whereas the eligibility clause in relation to an exemption notification is given strict meaning wherefor the notification has to be interpreted in terms of its language, once an assessee satisfies the eligibility clause, the exemption clause therein may be construed liberally.	Reasoning
An eligibility criteria, therefore, deserves a strict construction, although construction of a condition thereof may be given a liberal meaning.37.	Reasoning
The decision of this Court in Jindal Drilling and Indus.	Reasoning
Ltd.	Reasoning
(supra), relied upon by Mr. Ganguly has no application to the facts and circumstances of the instant case.38.	Reasoning
It is true that ordinarily, the golden rule of literal interpretation must be given effect to.	Reasoning
But it is also wellsettled that where literal interpretation gives rise to an anomaly or absurdity, the same should be avoided.	Reasoning
See Ashok Lanka and Another v. Rishi Dixit and Others, IV (2005)	Reasoning
SLT 614(2005)	Reasoning
5 SCC 598 Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v. MRTP Commission and Others, VI (2002)	Reasoning
SLT 543III (2002) CPJ 18 (SC)(2003) 1 SCC 129 .39.	Reasoning
Furthermore, it is also wellsettled that the Legislature always intends to avoid hardship.	Reasoning
In a situation of this nature, the exemption notification cannot be construed in a way which would prove to be oppressive in nature.	Reasoning
However, we do not intend to lay down a law that delay on the part of the authorities in granting such certificates would automatically enable an assessee to obtain refund.	Reasoning
Each case has to be judged on its own facts.40.	Reasoning
We, however, do not agree with the contention of Mr. Lakshmikumaran that by reason of a public notice issued by a Customs House situated in a State, the effect and purport of statutory notification can be taken away.	Reasoning
In terms of Section 151A of the Customs Act, it is only the Board which may issue instructions.	Reasoning
Even under the aforementioned provision, the Board exercises a limited power.	Reasoning
See Pahwa Chemicals (P) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise, New Delhi, III (2005)	Reasoning
SLT 374(2005) 2 SCC 720.	Reasoning
41.	Reasoning
Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the opinion that the Tribunal has committed no illegality in remitting the matter back to the Commissioner.	Reasoning
Civil Appeal No. 5900 of 2004 is, therefore, dismissed.	Reasoning
We for the reasons aforementioned remit the matter to the Commissioner for similar purpose in the matter of ONGC for consideration of the matter afresh.	Decision
The Commissioner is directed to send a copy of its order to this Court.	Decision
Other contentions raised by the parties herein shall remain open.	Decision
It is made clear that in the event the order of the Commissioner goes against the contentions of the assessee Tullow, it will be open to it to question the correctness thereof before an appropriate Forum.43.	Decision
Civil Appeal Nos. 1882 of 2004 and 854 of 2005 are adjourned sine die.	Decision
These appeals shall be listed as and when the order of the Commissioner is received.	Decision
