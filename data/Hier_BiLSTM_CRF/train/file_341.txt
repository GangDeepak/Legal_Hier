The first ground was that the complaint was not filed within twentyfour hours of disconnection as mandated under proviso to Section 135(1A) of the Indian Electricity (Amendment) Act, 2007.	None
Section 135(1A) of the Indian Electricity (Amendment) Act, 2007, reads as under (1A) Without prejudice to the provisions of this Act, the licensee or supplier, as the case may be, may, upon detection of such theft of electricity, immediately disconnect the supply of electricity Provided further that such officer of the licensee or supplier, as the case may be, shall lodge a complaint in writing relating to the commission of such offence in police station having jurisdiction within twentyfour hours from the time of such disconnection The second ground was that the Special Court has taken cognizance without any order of committal and the same is in violation of Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	Facts
In support of the said contention, respondent No.1, before the High Court, relied on a decision in the case of State of Andhra Pradesh, represented by its Public Prosecutor v. M s. Shalini Steels Private Limited, Bollaram, Medak District 2011 CrlLJ 67 .	Facts

Facts
In the impugned order, the High Court, mainly on the ground that the Special Court has taken cognizance directly and the same is not disputed by the learned Public Prosecutor, quashed the proceedings.	Facts
We have heard Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by the Advocate on record for the appellant, and also Mr. A. Sirajudeen, learned Senior Advocate, assisted by the Advocate on record for respondent No.1.	None
6(a)	Arguments of Petitioner
In this appeal, mainly it is contended by Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant, that the High Court has passed the impugned order without examining the proviso to Section 151 of the Electricity Act, 2003.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the proviso to Section 151 of the Electricity Act, 2003, specially empowers the Special Court to take cognizance directly, as such, it cannot be said that taking cognizance by the Special Court is in violation of provision under Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	Reasoning
Further, by referring to the additional affidavit and other material placed on record, it is submitted that on 12.11.2009, when it was suspected that respondent No.1 has tampered the meter, the said meter was replaced with another meter on the same day i.e., 12.11.2009 and the supply was not disconnected on the said date and disconnection has taken place after receipt of the Lab report only, that is on 25.11.2009.	None
To substantiate the said plea, the learned Senior Advocate further submitted that a bill was issued for consumption of energy by respondent No.1 for the period from 12.11.2009 till 25.11.2009.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submission of the learned Senior Advocate that in the case of Shalini Steels Private Limited (supra), on which reliance was placed, the High Court has rendered it based on the decision of this Court in the case of Gangula Ashok (supra), which was a case arising out of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that there is no provision in the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, equivalent to Section 151 of the Electricity Act, 2003.	Arguments of Petitioner
In that context, considering the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, this Court has held that the Special Court cannot take cognizance directly unless the case has been committed to it by a Committal Court as contemplated under Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that though respondent No.1 herein is an offender of theft of electricity for the second time, the High Court has committed error in quashing the proceedings without taking into consideration the proviso to Section 151 of the Electricity Act, 2003 On the other hand, Sri Sirajudeen, learned Senior Advocate appearing for respondent No.1, referring to the counter affidavit and other material on record, has submitted that the disconnection was made on 12.11.2009 and the complaint was lodged on 24.11.2009 which is ex facie time barred and the same is contrary to the proviso to Section 135(1A) of the Electricity Act, 2003 (Amendment Act 26 of 2007).	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that the Court which has taken cognizance of the offence is not a Special Court within the meaning of the Electricity Act, 2003.	Arguments of Respondent
It is further submitted that merely because the Presiding Officer is of the rank of Additional Sessions Judge, it cannot be construed as a Special Court within the meaning of the Electricity Act, 2003.	Arguments of Respondent
It is submitted that as the Court lacks jurisdiction, further the complaint was not lodged within twentyfour hours from disconnection, the cognizance taken against respondent No.1 is rightly quashed by the High Court and there are no grounds to interfere.	Arguments of Respondent
Having heard the learned counsel on both sides, we have perused the impugned order and the other material placed on record.	None
From a perusal of the order passed by the High Court, it is clear that the petition for quashing under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, was filed by respondent No.1 only on two grounds viz., (i) the complaint was not lodged within twentyfour hours as contemplated under Section 135(1A) of the Electricity Act, 2003 (Amendment Act 26 of 2007), and (ii) the Special Court has taken cognizance directly without an order of committal as contemplated under Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	Reasoning
The High Court had relied on its earlier decision in Shalini Steels Private Limited (supra) which itself was rendered based on the decision of this Court in Gangula Ashok (supra).	Reasoning
The High Court, only on the ground that taking cognizance of the case by the Special Court is not disputed by the learned Public Prosecutor, has passed the impugned order, quashing the proceedings.	Reasoning
It is true that as per the procedure under Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, no Court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate except as otherwise expressly provided by the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, or any other law for the time being in force.	None
Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as under Cognizance of offences by Courts of Session Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force, no Court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under this Code.	None
Section 151 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is altogether a new provision.	Reasoning
Section 151 of the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under the Act except upon a complaint in writing made by the Appropriate Government or Appropriate Commission or any of their officer authorised by them or a Chief Electrical Inspector or an Electrical Inspector or licensee or the generating company, as the case may be, for this purpose.	Reasoning
Second proviso to Section 151 of the Electricity Act, 2003, specially empowers the Special Court constituted under Section 153 of the Electricity Act, 2003, to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed.	Reasoning
In view of the specific provision under Section 151 of the Electricity Act, 2003, we are of the view that Special Court is empowered to take cognizance without there being an order of committal as contemplated under Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	Reasoning
When there is express provision in the Special Act empowering the Special Court to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed, it cannot be said that taking cognizance of offence by Special Court is in violation of Section 193 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.	Reasoning
It appears that the High Court has not considered the said proviso to Section 151 and passed the impugned order.	Reasoning
As the impugned order is passed only on the said ground, we are of the view that the order impugned is liable to be set aside by this Court.	Reasoning
Further, Mr. A. Sirajudeen, learned Senior Advocate appearing for respondent No.1, has submitted that the complaint was not lodged within twentyfour hours as required under Section 135(1A) of the Electricity Act, 2003, and also submitted that the Court which has taken cognizance is not a Special Court within the meaning of the Electricity Act, 2003.	Arguments of Respondent
Ms. Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant, has submitted that the date of disconnection as mentioned earlier as 12.11.2009 is not correct and that the power supply was disconnected only on 25.11.2009, as such, complaint was filed within the timeframe.	Arguments of Petitioner
Further, it is submitted by the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant that the Government vide G.O.Ms.	Arguments of Petitioner
No.118, Energy (PowerII) Department, dated 18.10.2003, notified the 1st Additional District Judges Court as a Special Court for the purpose of cases arising under the Electricity Act, 2003, as such, the Special Court is having competent jurisdiction.	Arguments of Petitioner
The aforesaid both grounds raised by respondent No.1 cannot be accepted to sustain the impugned order.	Reasoning
In view of the submission made by the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant that the disconnection was within the specified time and further the Government has already issued notification notifying the 1st Additional District Judges Court as a Special Court, we are not inclined to accept the submission made by the learned Senior counsel appearing for respondent No.1.	Reasoning
For the aforesaid reasons, we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order dated 03.12.2018 in Criminal Petition No.13678 of 2011 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad.	Decision
We make it clear that we have not gone into merits of the matter and it is open for the trial Court to record its own findings based on the evidence during trial Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, with an observation as indicated above.	None
Since the occurrence is of the year 2009, the trial court shall expedite the hearing of the case	Decision
