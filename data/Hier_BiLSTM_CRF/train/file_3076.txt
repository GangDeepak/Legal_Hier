 RATNAVEL PANDIAN, J. This appeal under special leave is directed against the judgment passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur disposing Criminal Reference No. 1 of 1977 submitted by the learned Sessions Judge, Raipur under Section 366(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code for confirmation of the sentence of death awarded by him in Session Trial No. 5 of 1977 and the criminal Appeal No. 307 of 1977 preferred by the appellant, Ashok Kumar Chatterjee challenging the correctness and legality of the judgment made by the trial court convicting him under Section 302 and 201 IPC and sentencing him to death and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 3 years respectively The facts of the case briefly stated are as followsThe deceased Ravindra, who was 19 years of age at the time of occurrence in 1976 was the son of Pritosh Kumar Chatterjee who was employed in Bhatapara as Laboratory Assistant in Government MultiPurpose Higher Secondary School.	Issue
He hailed from West Bengal.	Facts
The appellant, aged about 22 years, is a cousin of Pritosh3.	Facts
Pritosh was living with his wife (PW 2), his only daughter, aged about 15 years namely Supriya Bina and the appellant in Bhatapara in the house of PW 11.	Facts
The deceased who was a student in Raipur College had come to Bhatapara during the summer vacation4.	Facts
Though the motive for the appellant to murder Ravindra, as put forth now by the prosecution, is that there was a quarrel between Ravindra and the appellant on some money matters, the real motive seems to be a story of shameful intrigue as disclosed from the evidence of PW 2, the wife of Pritosh.	Facts
According to PW 2, her husband Pritosh was a man of very bad and indecent character and he was living in a private hell of his own satisfying his lust with his own daughter, Supriya.	Facts
In the crossexamination also PW 2 affirms that her husband had illicit relations with Supriya.	Facts
On account of this abnormal sexual and obnoxious behaviour of Pritosh, there used to be frequent quarrels between PW 2 and her husband.	Facts
It further transpires from the evidence that the appellant who was none other than the cousin brother of Pritosh, was also making overtures to Supriya and this was resented by the deceased Ravindra who was in the prime of his youth5.	Facts

Among the letters seized, Exs. P13 to P15 (letters written in Bengali) and Ex.	Facts
P29 and Ex. P31 (letters written in Hindi) and the envelopes Exs.	None
P30 and P32 were found.	None
Exs.	None
P61 and P63 are the specimen Hindi writings of the appellant and Exs.	None
P18 to P20 are the specimen Bengali writing of the appellant.	None
These letters along with specimen handwriting were sent to PWs 22 and 23 who were the Additional and Assistant Station Examiners of Questioned Documents (i. e. handwriting experts) for comparison of the writings of these letters with the specimen writings of the appellant.	Facts
The experts on comparison have opined that all the seized letters were in the handwriting of the appellant16.	Facts
Besides the opinion of the experts, PW 2 who claims to have studied up to 3rd standard and to have been conversant with the handwriting of the appellant also has deposed that the writings in Exs.	Facts
P13 to P15, P29 and P31 are in the handwriting of the appellant.	None
In Exs. P13 and P15 (addressed to his father), and in Ex. P14 (addressed to Jamai Baboo), the appellant had given the detail of his love towards Supriya ( Bina) and of his guilt of murdering the deceased.	Facts
It may be pointed out that these letters were not posted.	Facts
Exs.	None
P29 and P31 (dated nil) found in the postal covers (Exs. P30 and P32) were addressed to the Collector and the Station House Officer	None
but they too were not posted.	None
The contents of those letters reveal that the appellant wanted to put an end to his life by committing suicide for the sin of murder he committed.	Facts
It seems that the appellant could not muster courage to end his life and so surrendered before the police.	Facts
Before leaving for the police station, the appellant wrote Ex.	None
P104 a postcard addressed to his father and posted the same.	None
This postcard (Ex. P104) written in Bengali was posted on July 13, 1976 at Bhatapara and it reached his father in Kalopur village on July 17, 1976.	Facts
This is an important document about which we shall discuss in the ensuing portion of the judgment17.	Facts
During the investigation, a knife and some letters inclusive of Ex. P104 were seized from the house of the father of the appellant in Kalopur village by PW 18.	Facts
Exs. P5 to P11, P16 and P17 are the letters proved to be in the handwriting of Pritosh through PWs 2, 3 and 22.	Facts
The contents of these letters show that after Pritosh and the appellant returned to Bhatapara from West Bengal the appellant confessed to Pritosh about his involvement in the murder of the deceased, and Pritosh who loved his son Ravindra and the appellant, without disclosing this confession of the appellant, decided to put an end to his life and ultimately did so.	Facts
Two other letters (Exs. P6 and P33) further show that at the initial stage both Pritosh and the appellant decided to commit suicide.	Facts
However, the sequence of events reveal that Pritosh alone committed suicide after his wife lodged the complaint with the police.	Facts
We may point out at this juncture that though the letters written by Pritosh cannot be made use of as legal evidence against the appellant, we are mentioning those letters and their contents only for the proper understanding of the sequence of events and the complete narration of the prosecution case18.	Facts
Exs. P184 and P185 are the reports of the Chemical Examiner and Serologist respectively.	None
As per the report of the Serologist the scrapings of the wall of the house and the pillow recovered from the house were stained with human blood.	Facts
The blood stains on some of the items of the properties were disintegrated and as such their origin could not be determined.	Facts
After completing the investigation PW 30 filed the chargesheet on October 28, 197619.	None
The appellant in his statement under Section 313 CPC has denied his complicity in the offence in question and added that he does not know anything about the letters produced by the prosecution and that he was tortured and pressurised to write certain letters and documents inclusive of a postcard at the police station and under pressure his signatures were obtained thereon20.	Facts
The trial court, as pointed supra, convicted the appellant under Sections 302 and 201 IPC and sentenced him to death and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 3 years.	Facts
The High Court for the reasons assigned in its judgment affirmed the convictions recorded by the trial court but modified the sentence of death to imprisonment for life while retaining the rigorous imprisonment for 3 years under Section 201	Facts
IPC The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant assailed the judgment of the High Court, inter alia, contending(1) That the prosecution has not satisfactorily established the guilt of the appellant through cogent, reliable and trustworthy evidence from which the guilt of the accused is to be drawn and the evidence available on record does not lead to any irresistible conclusion that the appellant alone, and none else, committed this heinous crime(2)	Arguments of Petitioner
All the letters except Ex. P104 have not been posted and they were all fabricated only at the police station under pressure brought on the appellant who was pressurised to sign those letters and as such the contents of all those letters should be rejected in toto(3)	Arguments of Petitioner
The date, July 11, 1976 mentioned in Ex.	None
P104 would indicate that the appellant had been taken into custody by the police either on July 11, 1976 or much earlier and that this letter had been fabricated while he was in the police custody and was posted on July 13, 1976.	None
This postcard (Ex. P104) raises a could of suspicion on the veracity of the prosecution case Incidentally, a feeble argument was advanced that the prosecution has not established the identity of the trunk, limbs and the severed head as that of Ravindra beyond all reasonable doubt This Court in a series of decisions has laid down the principles of law governing the exercise of powers by this Court to interfere in an appeal against conviction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India of which we shall make reference to a few In Hem Raj v. State of Ajmer this Court has clearly made the position of law thus (SCR pp. 113435)	None
Unless it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist that substantial and grave injustice has been done and the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against, this Court does not exercise its overriding powers under Article 136(1) of the Constitution In Ramaphupala Reddy v. State of Andhra Pradesh this Court expressed its view on this proposition of law thus (SCC p. 478, para 14)	None
Although the powers of this Court under that article (Article 136 of the Constitution) are very wide, this Court following the practice adopted by the Judicial Committee has prescribed limits on its own power and in criminal appeals, except under exceptional circumstances it does interfere with the findings of facts reached by the High Court unless it is of the opinion that the High Court had disregarded the forms of legal process or had violated the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has resulted.	None
This Court does not ordinarily reappraise the evidence if the High Court has approached the case before it in accordance with the guidelines laid down by this Court unless some basic error on the part of the High Court is brought to the notice of this Court.	None
It is best to bear in mind that except in certain special cases, the High Court is the final court of appeal and this Court is only a court of special jurisdiction Chandrachud, J as he then was in Balak Ram v. State of U. P. speaking for the bench said (SCC p. 227, para 26)	None
The powers of the Supreme Court under Article 136 are wide but in criminal appeals this Court does not interfere with the concurrent findings of fact save in exceptional circumstances.	None
In Ramaphupala Reddy v. State of A. P., it was observed that it was best to bear in mind that normally the High Court is a final court of appeal and the Supreme Court is only a court of special jurisdiction.	None
This Court would not therefore reappraise the evidence unless, for example, the forms of legal process are disregarded or principles of natural justice are violated or substantial and grave injustice has otherwise resulted This Court in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat wherein the High Court had affirmed the pure findings of facts recorded by the Sessions Court, observed (SCC p. 222, para 5) Such a concurrent finding of fact cannot be reopened in an appeal by special leave unless it is established (1) that the finding is based on no evidence or (2) that the finding is perverse, it being such as no reasonable person could have arrived at even if the evidence was taken at its face value or (3) the finding is based and built on inadmissible evidence, which evidence, if excluded from vision, would negate the prosecution case or substantially discredit or impair it or (4) some vital piece of evidence which would tilt the balance in favour of the convict has been overlooked, disregarded or wrongly discarded In a recent decision in Appabhai v. State of Gujarat the following dictum is laid down (SCC p. 244, para 8) Before we consider the contentions urged for the appellants, we may recall that these are appeals by special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution.	None
If conclusions of the courts below are supported by acceptable evidence, this Court will not exercise its overriding powers to interfere with the decision appealed against.	None
This Court also will not consider the contentions relating to reappreciation of the evidence which has been believed by the courts below.	None
The fact that the special leave has been granted should not make any difference to this practice.	None
The grant of special leave does not entitle the parties to open out and argue the whole case.	None
The parties are not entitled to contest all findings recorded by the courts below unless it is shown by error apparent on the record that substantial and grave injustice has been done to them We shall now, bearing in mind the scope of interference by this Court in an appeal against concurrent findings, dispose this appeal in this light of the principle of law enunciated by this Court in the abovementioned authoritative judicial pronouncements This appeal arises against the concurrent findings of facts except for the modification of the sentence made by the High Court.	None
There is no direct evidence to prove this case and the conviction is founded solely on circumstantial evidence.	None
This Court in a line of decisions has consistently held that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such evidence must satisfy the following tests (1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly established (2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused (3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else, and (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence.	None
(See Gambhir v. State of Maharashtra.)	None
See also Rama Nand v. State of Himachal Pradesh, Prem Thakur v. State of Punjab, Earabhadrappa v. State of Karnataka, Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Balwinder Singh v. State of Punjab Before adverting to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel, we shall first of all dispose of the contention with reference to the identity of the victim The unfortunate victim in this case is one Ravindra who was aged about 19 years at the time of the occurrence and who was the only son of Pritosh and PW 2.	None
According to the prosecution, the scene of occurrence was the house of the deceased himself and he was done away with at about 4.45 a. m. on June 10, 1976.	None
Indisputably, it is a very macabre incident in which the deceased had been brutally parts of Bhatapara city.	None
Though the headless body and the various limbs were seen and recovered on June 11, 1976, the decapitated head was seen and recovered only on June 12, 1976.	None
A photograph of the head was taken under Ex. P12.	None
Though PW 2, the mother of Ravindra on seeing Ex.	None
P12 identified it to be that of her son, the learned Judges held that since the features of the face in x. P12 cannot be deciphered, it is impossible for any person to identify the deceased from Ex. P12.	None
In view of this, they were reluctant to place reliance on the identification by PW 2 on seeing Ex. P12.	None
However, the High Court relying on other facts of the case concurring with the trial court came to the conclusion that the deceased was Ravindra.	None
According to the evidence, Ravindra was of a fair complexion aged about 19 years.	None
The Medical Officer has deposed that the skin of the deceased was of fair complexion.	None
In the postmortem certificate (Ex. P45), the approximate age of the male body is given as 18 to 29 years and the skin was of fair colour.	None
The Medical Officer has further stated that the decapitated head was that of the body recovered on the earlier day.	None
The scrapings of the wall of the kitchen portion of the scene house are proved to have been stained with human blood.	None
The pillow recovered from the house also is proved to have been stained with human blood.	None
These circumstances indicate that the occurrence had taken place inside the house of the deceased.	None
In the number of letters inclusive of Ex.	None
P104 the appellant himself has unequivocally conferred that the deceased was Ravindra.	None
The letters written by Pritosh about which we have made reference in the narrative portion of this judgment also refers to the murder of Ravindra.	None
In view of the above unassailable circumstances, we are fortified in our view that both the courts have rightly found that the dead body was that of Ravindra and we do not see any reason to dislodge that concurrent finding The prosecution rests its case on a number of attending circumstances, which establish the guilt of the appellant.	None
As was pointed out during the earlier part of this judgment though the prosecution has suggested the motive for the accused to commit this murder on a money dealing, the real motive behind the occurrence seems to be a gross indecent behavior of the appellant towards Supriya Bina, who is done other than the sister of the deceased.	None
It is in the evidence of PW 2 that even Pritosh, the father of Supriya had sexually assaulted his own daughter on earlier occasions and that this appellant was also making overtures towards Supriya thereby exhibiting his asinine behaviour.	None
Therefore, it is but natural that the deceased should have taken a strong objection to the conduct of the appellant and this had resulted in the murder of Ravindra At the time when the victim was murdered except the appellant and the deceased, there was none in the scene house because PW 2 had left Bhatapara with her daughter and Pritosh and followed them some time later.	None
In the evidence of PW 11 who is the landlord of the scene house it is said that Ravindra was seen in the house in the company of the appellant up to June, 1976.	None
The appellant was not found in the village after this murder till he surrendered before the police i. e. on June 13, 1976.	None
After this incident, the appellant went to Mongram where his parents and brothers reside and met Pritosh and PW 2.	None
When PW 2 asked the appellant at Mongram about her sons whereabouts, the appellant falsely replied that Ravindra had gone to Bombay in search of some employment.	Facts
The conduct of the appellant in giving this manifestly blatant false reply to PW 2s enquiry, spells out his guilty conscience.	None
The number of letters namely Exs. P13 to P15, Exs.	None
P29 and P31 written in Bengali and Hindi were seized from the house.	None
These letters are proved to be in the handwriting of the appellant, as seen from the evidence of PW 22 and PW 23 who were the State Examiners of Questioned Documents.	None
PW 2 who claims to have studied up to 3rd standard has also deposed that the writing of those letters are in the handwriting of the appellant.	Facts
In fact the accused also did not deny his handwriting but would try to explain that those letters were got written under pressure brought by the police on him.	None
In these letters which were not posted, the accused had confessed that he had murdered the deceased.	None
There is one more clinching evidence connecting the appellant with the crime in question is the contents of the postcard (Ex. P104).	None
This postcard had been posted at Bhatapara on July 13, 1976 i. e. on the very same day of the suicidal death of Pritosh.	None
Much argument was advanced on this postcard.	None
According to the prosecution this postcard which was posted at Bhatapara on July 13, 1976 reached the appellants father on July 17, 1976 at Kalopur.	None
This postcard is written in Bengali.	None
PW 23 has testified that the writing in the postcard is that of the appellant.	None
This Ex. P104 is dated July 11, 1976.	None
The learned counsel for the defence advanced his argument contending that since the postcard is dated July 11, 1976, the appellant should have been taken to the police custody even much earlier to July 13, 111976 and this letter was fabricated.	None
We are unable to accept this contention.	None
In fact, a similar argument was raised before the High Court which repelled the same.	None
Admittedly Pritosh committed suicide on July 13, 1976.	None
In the postcard there is reference to the death of Pritosh Therefore, it is evident that this postcard should have been written after the death of Pritosh and then posted.	None
Presumably, the appellant would have put the date on the postcard as July 11, 1976 by mistake.	None
In view of the surrounding circumstances and the contents found in the postcard we are in total agreement with the finding of the High Court that the appellant should have put the date by mistake, and hold that this argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is not acceptable.	None
The contents of this letter clearly show that Ravindra was murdered by the appellant on June 10, 1976 and that the appellant coming to know about the suicide of his cousin brother, Pritosh had decided to surrender before the police and suffer the consequences.	None
Though the appellant in general had stated that he was tortured by the police and pressurised to write certain letters and documents and to sign them, he when specifically questioned under Section 313 CPC answered that he did not know anything about those letters The learned defence counsel in support of his contention that there was police torture would draw the attention of this Court to certain admissions of PW 2 in the crossexamination admitting that the police had harassed all of them and persistently enquired about the reason for Pritosh to commit suicide, and that the appellant on being arrested by the police was highly perplexed and all of them went on admitting what the police said.	None
We have carefully scanned these admissions of PW 2 but found that these admissions could not in any way affect the veracity of the prosecution case.	None
As we have pointed out Pritosh committed suicide in very tragic circumstances by throwing himself before a running train only after PW 2 had approached the police by lodging Ex. P82 and handing over two photographs of her son with the request to make an investigation about the missing of her son.	Reasoning
Evidently Pritosh who on being put to painful ignominy by his obnoxious conduct of having sexual relationship with his own daughter should have resorted to putting an end to his life apprehending that the whole shameful intrigue would come out and he would be exposed to the public.	Reasoning
PW 2 by then had not come out with the story of her husbands abnormal sexual behaviour.	Reasoning
Therefore, the police in order to unearth the real cause for the suicidal death Pritosh would have taken all the inmates of the house to the police station and subjected them to intensive and searching examination.	Reasoning
It was only during such examination of these witnesses over the cause of the death of Pritosh, the whole truth about this case came out.	Reasoning
It is not surprising that the appellant would have been in an agitated and perplexed state of mind because he was in exclusive knowledge of his own conduct of having committed the murder of the deceased which led to the suicidal death of Pritosh who on account of his uncivilized and filthy conduct in our opinion was only a beast in the human form37.	Reasoning
Hence we hold that this argument of the earned counsel does not merit consideration38.	Reasoning
For all the discussions made above we are of the view that there are number of impelling circumstances attending this case leading to an irresistible and inescapable conclusion that it was the appellant and the appellant alone who caused the death of the deceased, Ravindra in a very ghastly manner by cutting him into pieces and throwing his various parts of body at different parts of the city, Bhatapara and there cannot be any dispute that this coldblooded murder is diabolical in conception and extremely cruel in execution.	Reasoning
The evaluation of the findings of the High Court does not suffer from any illegality, or manifest error or perversity nor it has overlooked or wrongly discarded any vital piece of evidence.39.	Reasoning
Hence was hold that the findings of facts recorded by the courts below do not call for any interference40.	Decision
In the result, the appeal is dismissed.	Decision
