None
However, there was no response from the SRA.	None
On 02.06.2006, Sigtia wrote a letter to SRA enclosing a cheque for a sum of Rs.2.5 crores towards the interest free deposit with SRA as the performance related guarantee as directed by the High Court in its judgment dated 11.03.2005.	None

Sigtia was again not made a party in the special leave petition.	None
This Court, on 27.06.2006, passed an order directing SRA to issue Letter of Intent in favour of Keya within two weeks.	None
Mr. Arun Jaitley, learned senior counsel strenuously contended that before issuance of the Letter of Intent certain conditions ought to be fulfilled by a developer as per the rules and regulations of SRA and as per the guidelines and regulations of SRA, a developer needs to obtain AnnexureII and AnnexureIII from SRA.	Arguments of Petitioner
Annexure II is issued when the developer shows that he has consent from atleast 70 eligible hutment dwellers and Annexure III is issued when SRA is satisfied about the financial and technical capability of the developer.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is not disputed that the applicant has obtained both the Annexures and therefore there is no reason for not issuing LOI to the applicant.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that the Keya Developer does not have consent of atleast 70 hutment dwellers and therefore is not entitled to get LOI issued in its favour for the said project.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover SRA having been set up by the State in exercise of its powers under the Slum Act, it is ultimately for it to decide as to who should be permitted to undertake the redevelopment of slum and the SRA has shown confidence in the applicant by filing affidavits before the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No.988 of 2004.According to Mr. Arun Jaitley, the purported termination of the development agreement with Sigtia by the society is illegal, without authority of law as the society has no authority to do so.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted that 1054 slum dwellers filed consent affidavits in favour of the applicant in the year 2002 itself and therefore the Chief Promoter and few Committee members of the Society cannot terminate the appointment of the developer.	Arguments of Petitioner
In fact the original Writ Petitioner who filed Writ Petition No. 988/2004, namely, Nazir Khan Yakub Khan and others made serious allegations against the Chief Promoter  Shri Vichare and few Managing Committee members that they have manipulated the records and got the extra units to their family members.13.	Arguments of Petitioner
He would further submit that as per Section 3(k) of the Maharashtra Slum Area (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, the SRA is bound to follow the directions given by the Government of Maharashtra for the implementation of provisions under the Act and that the Government issued directions to SRA to issue letter of intent to Sigtia way back on 20.06.2005 but those directions have not been complied with.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Jaitley further submitted that the main grievance of the slum dwellers in the I.As filed in this Court and in the Writ Petition No.1277 of 2006 is that no steps have been taken by Sigtia Constructions towards the completion of the project.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted that after obtaining Annexure II and Annexure III from SRA, when the applicant was about to get LOI the writ petition No. 988 of 2005 was filed on 31.3.2004 challenging the technical and financial capability of the applicant.	Arguments of Petitioner
After the said Writ Petition was dismissed, the applicant approached SRA many times to get LOI but it received no response and this fact has been recorded by the Principal Secretary, Housing in its order dated 20.06.2005.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thereafter, stay order was passed by this Court in SLP(C)	Arguments of Petitioner
No.19848 of 2005 staying the order of the High Court dated 11.03.2005 passed in Writ Petition No. 988 of 2004.	Arguments of Petitioner
After the said SLP was dismissed by this Court on 13.04.2006 the applicant has written several letters to SRA to issue LOI and also sent a cheque of Rs. 2.51 crores but the same was not accepted by SRA.	Arguments of Petitioner
That there has been no delay on the part of the applicant in the implementation of the development work but it is due to frivolous litigations filed by some slum dwellers who were put up by rival developers that the project was stalled.14.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Arun Jaitely further submitted that the applicant was a necessary party in the Writ Petition No.1277 of 2006 and also to the above special leave petition as it was appointed as developer by the society and is at having consent of more than 70 of the slum dwellers in the area and therefore, any order passed issuing Letter of Intent to some other developer gravely injures the applicant and therefore no such order can be passed without giving an opportunity to the applicant to be heard.15.	Arguments of Petitioner
Concluding his arguments, Mr. Jaitley submitted that the order has been obtained behind the back of the applicant Sigtia and that the order is contrary to the order of the High Court dated 11.03.2005 passed in writ petition No. 988 of 2004 which has become final with the dismissal of Special Leave Petition No. 11318 of 2005 and 19848 of 2005.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this context, Mr. Arun Jaitley invited our attention to the order dated 11.03.2005 passed in Writ Petition No. 988 of 2004.16.	Arguments of Petitioner
At the time of hearing, Mr. Jaitley also invited our attention to the order passed by the High Court in Writ Petition No. 1277 of 2006 dated 04.05.2006.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is useful to reproduce the said short order which reads thus CORAM F.I. REBELLO ANOOP V. MOHTA,	Arguments of Petitioner
JJ.DATE 4th	Arguments of Petitioner
May,2006.P.C.In the ordinary course, we would not have entertained this petition when there is a society who is responsible for the development.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, on behalf of respondent No.2, their learned counsel makes a statement that they had already communicated to Respondent No.1 to appoint respondent No.3 as a developer and that the application is pending before the Respondent No.1 pursuant to the termination of the first developer by Respondent No.2.

He also drew our attention to para 12 of the order in Writ Petition No. 988 of 2004 passed by the High Court which reads thus The SRA having been set up by the State in exercise of its power under the Slum Act, it is ultimately, for it to decide as to who should be permitted to undertake the redevelopment of slum.	None
In this behalf, perusal of the relevant statutory provisions including Section 13 would make it abundantly clear that the SRA is empowered to permit land holders of occupants of an area which is declared as slum rehabilitation area to undertake scheme of development of such land and if they do not come forward with a scheme for redevelopment within a reasonable time, the SRA may decide to redevelop such land by entrusting it to any other Agency.	None
In the instant case, respondent No.7 has been selected by respondent No.6.	None
The SRA is satisfied that the requisite 70 numbers occupiers of slum area have come forward and reposed confidence in respondent no.7.	None
Since petitioners raised objections to the capacity and capability of respondent No.7, this Court issued directions that these aspects be scrutinized and verified once again.	None
Even that exercise is now complete and a report is submitted by the CEO of SRA.	None
In such circumstances, we are of the view that all aspects have been considered by the SRA and its decision cannot be faulted.	None
More so, when the proposal is at a primary stage.	None
Our attention has also been drawn to the order of this Court in Special Leave Petition No. 19848 of 2005 dated 13.04.2006 dismissing the writ petition as withdrawn filed by Mr. Nilesh Wakadey and Ors. preferred against the judgment and order dated 11.03.2005 in Writ Petition No. 988 of 2004.	None

Mr. Goolam E. Vahanvati, learned Solicitor General appeared for the Slum Rehabilitation Authority.	Arguments of Respondent
He placed before us the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971.	Arguments of Respondent
He also invited our attention to the procedure for submission, processing and approval of Slum Rehabilitation Schemes which reads thus All slums and pavements whose inhabitants names and structures appear in the electoral roll prepared with reference to 1st January, 1995 or a date prior thereto and who are actual occupants of the hutments are eligible for the slum rehabilitation scheme.2. 70 or more of the eligible hutmentdwellers in a slum or pavement in a viable stretch at one place have to show their willingness to join slum rehabilitation scheme and come together to form a cooperative housing society of all eligible hutmentdwellers through a resolution to that effect.	Arguments of Respondent
The following resolution should be adopted(a) Resolution electing a chief Promoter.(b)	Arguments of Respondent
Resolution giving the chief promoter authority to apply for reservation of name for cooperative housing society.(c)	Arguments of Respondent
To collect share capital (Rs. 50/ per member for slum societies) and Re. 1/ as entrance fee and to open account in Mumbai District Central Cooperative Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank Ltd (any branch)3.	Arguments of Respondent
The chief promoter, office bearers and the members of the proposed society should collect the documents such as 7/12 extract and the PR card of the plot on which the slum is situate.	Arguments of Respondent
They should then get the plot surveyed measured and prepare map of the plot showing slum structures therein with the help of surveyors attached to the office of Additional Collector (Encroachment) or the Deputy Collector (Encroachment) or the Deputy Collector (Encroachment of the zone.4.	Arguments of Respondent
While undertaking the survey, they should collect the information of the proposed members slumdwellers and fill up land occupied by the slumdwellers, number and type of structures such as residential, industrial, commercial, amenity structures etc. and the list of eligible and ineligible occupants and consent of the slumdwellers to join the scheme.	Arguments of Respondent
Earlier the promoter cooperative housing society had to first approach the different Competent Authorities namely Additional Collector for the slums on government and private lands and the land owning authorities for the slums on different public authority lands, for obtaining certified AnnexureII, before they could put in application for slum rehabilitation scheme SRA.	Arguments of Respondent
As a simplification measure, this procedure is now discontinued and AnnexureII format is now required to be filled by the promoter cooperative housing society itself for submitting building proposal to SRA, so that the scrutiny of the proposal and certification of AnnexureII can start simultaneously.	None
AnnexureII needs to be submitted in duplicate.	None
As a measure of further simplification, Additional Collector (Encroachment) is being designated as the sole Competent Authority for deciding eligibility and for taking eviction action against nonparticipants in slum rehabilitation schemes.5.	Arguments of Respondent
The chief promoter and the office bearers of the proposed society should then apply for name reservation of the proposed cooperative housing society along with the selfprepared AnnexureII and the required resolutions to the Assistant Registrar of Cooperative Societies.	Arguments of Respondent
To facilitate this, office of the Assistant Registrar has been started in SRA itself.	Arguments of Respondent
It is no longer necessary to approach different offices of the Cooperation Department for this purpose.	None
The assistant Registrar SRA will issue a letter reserving the name for the proposed cooperative housing society and permission to open a bank account in the proposed societys name.6.	Arguments of Respondent
While the above steps are being taken, the decision to search a competent developer to act as a promoter has to be taken up by the proposed cooperative housing society of slumdwellers.	None
The society itself or an NGO developer owner can take up slum rehabilitation scheme as a promoter.7.	Arguments of Respondent
The promoter so chosen has to enter into agreement with every eligible slumdweller while putting up slum rehabilitation proposal to SRA for approval.	Arguments of Respondent
SRA is in the process of trying to evolve standard formats for the following four types of agreements required in the scheme, with the approval of the State Government.a)	Arguments of Respondent

The promoter has also to appoint an architect in consultation with the proposed cooperative housing society of slumdwellers to prepare the plans of development of the slum area as per the DCR33(10).	Arguments of Respondent
It is expected that the architect ensures community participation in preparation of the building plans.	None
All required documents such as building plan, layout plan, PR Card etc. along with AnnexureI, AnnexureII and AnnexureIII are to be submitted to SRA by the architect along with an application for the slum rehabilitation scheme.	Arguments of Respondent
A checklist of all such documents required for submission is available in SRA office.10.	None
AnnexureIII is prescribed to asses the financial capability of the promoter.	None
The items contained in AnnexureIII are self explanatory.	None

The SRA also to verify the resolution passed by the general body of the slum dwellers, proposed society by majority for appointing or replacing the developer for the development of the scheme.	Arguments of Respondent
It is also necessary to verify by the SRA to see whether the plot under the development is not affected by any reservation such as playground or recreation ground in view of the interim stay order in writ Petition No. 1152 of 2002 of the High Court.	Reasoning
The SRA has to verify whether the proposed appointed developer has the financial capacity to undertake and complete the same.	None
Therefore, in the context of the submissions made above by the learned Solicitor General further directions with regard to this Courts order dated 27.06.2006 should be given to SRA.	None
As already noticed, the writ petition No. 1277 of 2006 was filed by the very same petitioner in SLP No. 10281 of 2006 Sigtia was not made a party to the writ petition No. 1277 of 2006.	None
However, the High Court, by order dated 04.05.2006 in writ petition No. 1277 of 2006 has directed the SRA to call the parties in terms of the judgment of the High Court dated 11.03.2005 in writ petition No. 988 of 2004 and after hearing the parties disposed of the application of the society respondent No.2 according to law within 6 weeks from 04.03.2006.	None
It is also useful to refer to the direction given in the order dated 11.03.2005 in para 20 in writ petition No. 988 of 2004.	None
The High Court, by the said order, has observed that it is not necessary to quash or set aside the Scheme or issue further directions as sought and that final approval have not been granted by SRA and if SRA decides not to issue the Letter of Intent in favour of respondent No.7 (Sigtia), it will always be open for the parties to submit a fresh development scheme.	None
In view of the order dated 11.03.2005 and 04.05.2006 of the High Court, the learned Solicitor General submitted that the SRA has to call both Sigtia and Keya in order to dispose of the application of the society according to law.	None
Mr. Harish Salve appearing for the petitioner in special leave petition Shri Ramchandra Mahadev Jagpat submitted that SRA cannot decide any contractual dispute and that the order dated 11.03.2005 put certain obligations on Sigtia and that the Society in its general body meeting dated 29.05.2005 terminated the agreement with Sigtia and decided to invite other builders.

He also drew our attention to the subsequent events in the appointment of Keya Developers and the letter dated 10.06.2005 issued to Keya Developers made in the I.A. in 19848 of 2005 filed by Babita Baliram.	None
He also invited our attention to the second round of litigation on the nondeposit of the amount by Sigtia.	None
He also submitted that Sigtia have acted on termination and have not challenged the termination of the agreement.	None
Mr. Salve also submitted that there is no question of fraud having played upon by this Court as alleged or told and that the applicant Sigita has conveniently not mentioned that his agreement with the society had come to an end by efflux of time and stood cancelled on 24.04.2005 and that the society had also unanimously terminated the appointment of Sigtia as the developer and that the prayer in writ petition No. 1277 of 2006 was directed against the SRA and that there was no prayer or relief sought against the Sigtia and, therefore, Sigtia was not arrayed as a party in the said writ petition and that there was also no reason to make Sigtia as a party as they had been replaced by a new developer as far back as June, 2005 of which the Sigtia had notice.	None
Mr. Salve further submitted that it is incorrect to say that the parties before this Court in special leave petition (C) No. 10281 of 2006 were not the affected parties.	None
In fact all the parties are affected parties excepting the Sigtia who has undertaken no development work from 1997 and even after agreement dated 2002 was entered into with the society and therefore, Sigtia has no subsisting legal or other rights whatsoever and the present I.A. to recall the order deserves to be dismissed.	None

9 of 2006 Mr. Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel filed an application for impleadment in I.A. No. 9 of 2006 on behalf of Nazeer Khan Yakub Khan who is also slum dweller.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned senior counsel submitted even that in 1997 Sigtia was appointed by the Society as a developer for the slum and the appointment was approved by SRA.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, no efforts were taken by Sigtia for development.	Arguments of Petitioner
As per the agreement Sigtia the agreement has to complete the entire development work within 3 years and if the development work was not so completed the agreement was to be treated as cancelled automatically.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further argued that Sigtia had taken no efforts for development of the slum and in fact had no financial or technical capability to carry out the development.	Arguments of Petitioner
Sigtia had also not deposited the 2.5 crores as interest free deposit and, therefore, the applicant in I.A.	Arguments of Petitioner
No. 9 of 2006 filed special leave petition No. 11318 of 2005 before this Court challenging the order dated 11.03.2005 and in the meantime, the agreement of Sigtia with the society to develop the slum itself came to an end on the expiry of 3 years from the date of agreement and, thereafter, the Society at a general body meeting dated 29.05.2005 resolved to terminate the appointment of Sigtia as the developer and the SRA was also informed of such decision since the appointment of Sigtia stood terminated and a new developer had been appointed the applicant Nazeer Khan Yakub Khan had no further grievance as it was apparent that the development work of the slum would finally commence and in these circumstances the applicant withdraw special leave petition (C) No. 11318 of 2005 on 26.09.2005.31.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. Dave further submitted that the applicant in IA No. 9 of 2006 had always opposed the appointment of Sigtia as developers as they had no technical capability to carry out the development work and in fact undertook no work whatsoever for over 8 years to the department of the slum dwellers and other similar situate slum dwellers.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted the order in special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006 is fair and just and in the interest of the slum dwellers who will finally be able to see the development work of their slum being undertaken and that the Sigtia have no legal right for undertaking the development of the slum in view of the termination and automatic cancellation of their agreement with the Society.

We have perused the intervention application.	Arguments of Petitioner
The applicant was not a party to the earlier writ petition.	Arguments of Petitioner

Ltd. intervened in the matter by representing that another society by name Ville Parle Premnagar Cooperative Society (proposed) had appointed the said Sigtia as developer.	Arguments of Petitioner
The applicant was not a party to the writ petition No. 988 of 2004 filed by some of the hutment dwellers not to issue annexure3 and Letter of Intent in favour of Sigtia.	Arguments of Petitioner
The applicant or the original society was not a party to the said writ petition upon knowledge the applicant has taken out chamber summons in the petition to intervene in the matter.	Arguments of Petitioner
The High Court dismissed the writ petition and also the chamber summons as it was too late for the applicant to apply to joint as party to the said writ petition.	Arguments of Petitioner
The applicant again made a representation to the SRA.	Arguments of Petitioner
The applicants are agreeable to obtain similar agreement from slum dwellers in support of the said proposal with a view to develop the property.33.	Arguments of Petitioner
Writ petition No. 1277 of 2006 was also filed by the petitioners without impleading the applicant before the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is submitted without making the applicant a party the petitioner has obtained an order dated 27.06.20906 whereby this Court has directed the SRA to issue a Letter of Intent in favour of Keya Developers.	Arguments of Petitioner
Hence the applicant is making the present intervention application for recalling the said order dated 27.06.2006.	Arguments of Petitioner
In our opinion, the above I.A. has no merits and is belated.	Arguments of Petitioner
No relief can, therefore, be granted to the applicant.	Arguments of Petitioner
I.A.	Arguments of Petitioner
No. 8 of 2006 stands dismissed.	Arguments of Petitioner
Dr. Abhishek Singhvi, learned senior counsel appearing for Keya Developers submitted that Sigtia did not take any recourse to any legal proceedings to challenge the termination and by letter dated 10.06.2005 Keya was informed of the resolution appointing it as developer to develop the property on the terms and conditions mentioned therein.	Arguments of Petitioner
In view of the termination of Sigtia as developer two groups of slum dwellers who had filed special leave petition before this Court against the order of the High Court dated 11.03.2005 withdrew the special leave petition on 26.09.2005 and 13.04.2005 respectively.	Arguments of Petitioner
Sigtia was represented in the proceedings and did not represent the factum of expiry termination of the agreement between Sigtia and the society.	Arguments of Petitioner
Keyas since the intimation of the resolution of the society has been taking all steps within its power to prepare for the development of the property including the appointment of M s Anil Chawla and Associates as architects and made arrangements for a transit camp for residence of the members of the society during the period of redevelopment.	Arguments of Petitioner
The Keyas has also made arrangements with HDFC Bank Ltd. for provision of loan of over Rs. 12 crores towards the implementation of the project and is also ready and willing to deposit such amount as this Court may determine by way of security deposit.	None
Keyas has also approached the SRA for grant of Letter of Intent in its favour for the purpose of transit accommodation and has also already incurred an expenditure of Rs.45,56,720/	Arguments of Petitioner
Keyas has also not been served with any notice or order of any Court with respect to any challenge to the termination of the Sigtia or appointment of the Keyas as developer of the property.	None
In these circumstances, Dr. Singhvi submitted that the SRA was bound to consider the application for issue of Letter of Intent to Keyas and Keyas has also been approached from time to time by the society and its members for taking further steps to commence the actual work of redevelopment of the property.	Arguments of Petitioner
However, Keyas was unable to commence the actual work of redevelopment for want of Letter of Intent from the authority in the present special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006.	Arguments of Petitioner
This Court passed the order in the presence of the counsel for all the parties and deny that any fraud has been played upon this Court as alleged.	Arguments of Petitioner
It is further submitted Sigtia has been terminated as developer of the property long before the writ petition was filed in the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to learned senior counsel Sigtia is not a necessary party to the special leave petition and that it had the consent of more than 70 of the slum dwellers and that the same is in any event irrelevant after the termination of the contract with the society.	Arguments of Petitioner
Concluding his submission, learned senior counsel submitted that the applicant has failed to make out any good ground for the recall of the order dated 27.06.2006 and, therefore, the said application is liable to be dismissed.34.	Arguments of Petitioner
Mr. T.L. Nageswara Rao, learned senior counsel appearing for Vile Parle Premnagar Society submitted that in view of the termination of the agreement given to Sigtia, Sigtia is not a necessary party to the special leave petition 10281 and that the SRA should be directed to consider only the application made by Keyas.	Arguments of Petitioner
We have given our anxious and careful consideration to the lengthy submissions made by all the learned senior counsel appearing for the respective parties with reference to the pleadings, annexures etc.	None
The applicant Sigtia have explained to this Court as to how the deposit of Rs.2.5 crores was not be deposited with SRA.	Reasoning
It also denied that the agreement entered into between Sigtia and the society came to an end on 25.04.2005 by efflux of time.	Reasoning
In this context, Clause 22 of the agreement must be read as a whole and when so read, it would be clear that the developer was to start the actual construction after the issuance of the commencement certificate by the authority.	Reasoning
Therefore, the period of 3 years must be construed to begin from the date when commencement certificate is issued and not from the date of execution of the agreement.	Reasoning
It was also submitted that the letters dated 25.04.2005 and 06.06.2005 were issued by 2 or 3 members of the society who were acting with ulterior motive and in collusion with the rival developer.	Reasoning
Even the SRA to whom the letter dated 06.06.2005 was addressed in its counter affidavit filed before this Court in the present proceedings has stated that they did not take notice of the said letter of termination as the letter was not supported by the relevant resolution of the society.	Reasoning
After 11.03.2005, Sigtia approached the SRA on several occasions requesting for the issuance of the Letter of Intent but since no response was coming from the Housing Department of Government of Maharashtra on 10.06.1995.	Reasoning
In our view after the dismissal of the special leave petition No. 19848 of 2005, the order of the High Court dated 11.03.2005 attained finality and there was no proposal of M s Keya Developers before the SRA on 13.04.2006 and, therefore, there was no question of SRA considering the proposal made by the new developer.	Reasoning
In our view, Sigtia was a necessary party to the writ petition and to the special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006 as it directly affected by any order appointing Keya as developer.	Reasoning
The society has also entered into an agreement and also executed an irrevocable general Power of Attorney dated 19.03.2004 wherein expressed its satisfaction with the progress in the work made by the Sigtia and also by the undertaking dated 26.02.2004 where the society undertook to continue with Sigtia as developer till the completion of the SRA project.	Reasoning
Though it is contended by Sigtia that the termination by the society on 29.04.2005 was illegal and without authority, the Sigtia has not so far challenged the order of termination by the society.	Reasoning
This important factor has also to be taken note off by the SRA at the time of considering the case of Sigtia along with Keya Developers.	Reasoning
It is also stated that the consent affidavits of more than 70 of the slum dwellers had already been obtained by Sigtia.	Reasoning
It is also submitted in the rejoinder affidavit that Sigtia did have the technical expertise and financial capability to complete the work and that all these issues were decided in favour of Sigita by the High Court in writ petition No. 988 of 2004 by order dated 11.03.2005 which order has attained finality in view of the dismissal of special leave petition Nos. 11318 of 2005 and 19848 of 2005.	Reasoning
Sigtia, after receiving the copy of the letters dated 24.05.2006 and 06.06.2005 sent a reply dated 15.06.2005 wherein the Sigtia submitted that the purported termination is illegal and without any authority and no further reply was sent by the society to the said letter.	Reasoning
Moreover, in the hearing held before the Principal Secretary dated 20.06.2005, the representative of the society made no arguments with regard to the purported termination of the agreement.	Reasoning
Therefore, it is contended that the society has not acted on the letter of termination and that the matter has come to an end and, therefore, Sigtia did not file any petition to challenge the purported termination.	Reasoning
It is also argued that the prayer in the writ petition No. 1277 of 2006 adversely affects the interests of the Sigtia.	Reasoning
It is stated that with the dismissal of special leave petition No. 19848 of 2005 all the applications filed in the said petition also stood dismissed and, therefore, the petitioners in the special leave petition had no right to approach this Court by way of writ petition making the same prayer which was made in the application for directions filed in special leave petition No. 19848 of 2005 and that the effect of the order dated 13.04.2006 is that the order of the High Court dated 11.03.2005 which was not challenged in the special leave petition attained finality and that in the application for directions filed in the special leave petition No. 19848 of 2005 the society had raised the issue of termination of agreement of Sigtia and appointment of Keya developers and the same stood dismissed with the dismissal of the said special leave petition.	Reasoning
Therefore, as rightly pointed out by Mr. Arun Jaitley in any subsequent proceedings where the termination of the agreement of applicant Sigtia with the society and replacement of Sigtia a new developer is a subjectmatter, Sigtia is a proper and necessary party to it.	Reasoning
We see much force and substance in the said argument.	Reasoning
In our view, the applicant Sigtia has also the right to have a hearing before the SRA along with Keya Developers, the new appointee.	Reasoning
It must also be seen that the relief sought in the special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006 though only against SRA but in effect against the applicant Sigtia and, therefore, Sigtia is the necessary party to any proceedings wherein the replacement of the Sigtia with a new developer and the termination of the agreement with the Sigtia is in issue and, therefore, Sigtia should have been made a party respondent in the writ petition No. 1277 of 2004 as well as special leave petition	Reasoning
No. 10281 of 2006.	Reasoning
It is also not in dispute that Sigtia was impleaded as party respondent No. 7 in the special leave petition which came to be withdrawn by the petitioner therein on 26.09.2005 on which date Sigtia appeared through their advocate in this Court.	Reasoning
As rightly submitted by the learned Solicitor General after the withdrawal of special leave petition No. 11318 of 2005 by the petitioner Nazeer Khan Yakub Khan both the developers i.e. M s Sigtia and Keya Developers kept on submitting applications with the SRA.	Reasoning
However, due to pendency of the special leave petition in this Court, SRA was not able to take any decision on the representations of the developers as well as the society.	Reasoning
At the time of hearing, our attention was also drawn to the guidelines and the several conditions to be fulfilled by the slum dwellers the society as well as the developers and the remarks required to be obtained on the proposal from the concerned authorities before issuing Letter of Intent.	Reasoning
The SRA has also to verify the resolution as passed by the general body of the slum dwellers proposed society by majority for appointing or replacing the developers for the development of the scheme.	Reasoning
It is also necessary for SRA to verify and to see whether the plot under the development is not affected by any reservation such as playground or recreation ground in view of the stay granted by the High Court in writ petition No. 1152 of 2002 and also to verify whether the proposed appointed developer has the financial capacity to undertake and complete the scheme.	Reasoning
Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, we hold that Sigtia is a necessary and proper party to the special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006 filed by Ramchandra Mahadev Jagpat Ors.	Reasoning
We say that the order dated 27.06.2006 was passed in S.L.P. No. 10281/2006 on the basis of representation made by all the respective senior counsel appearing at that time.	Reasoning
The order was not obtained as playing fraud on Court as alleged by the applicant herein.	Reasoning
Now, it is brought to our notice and made out a clear case as to why Sigtia was a necessary party to the special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006 and in the light of the directions given by the High Court dated 11.03.2005 in writ petition No. 988 of 2004 and of the order dated 04.05.2006 in writ petition No. 77 of 2006.	Reasoning
We have, therefore, no hesitation to recall our order dated 27.06.2006 in special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006.	Reasoning
Since the entire matter was argued at length now by all the respective senior counsel, there is no necessity to rehear special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006.	Reasoning
This apart in the concluding portion of our order dated 27.06.2006 in special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006, this Court directed the SRA to issue proper orders within two weeks from 27.06.2006.	Reasoning
The said direction is also not correct.	Reasoning
This Court ought to have directed the SRA, if at all, to consider issuing of the Letter of Intent in favour of Keya Developers in view of the replacement of previous Developers M s Sigtia.	Reasoning
We, therefore, allow the application I.A.	Decision
No. 3 of 2006 filed by the applicant Sigtia and recall our order dated 27.06.2006 passed in special leave petition No. 10281 of 2006 and pass the following order As directed by the order in writ petition No. 988 of 2004 dated 11.03.2005 and order dated 04.05.2006 in writ petition No. 1277 of 2006 the SRA is directed to call the two developers, namely, M s Keya and M s Sigtia and dispose of their application for issuing the Letter of Intent and to pass appropriate orders and in accordance with the Maharashtra Slum Areas Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment Act, 1971 and also strictly following the procedure for submission processing and approval of Slum Rehabilitation Scheme and to Award the Letter of Intent to the developer who satisfies the required qualifications and conditions and regulations and the provision of the Act, 1971.37.	Decision
The SRA is also directed to consider as to whether the guidelines and other conditions are fulfilled by the slum dwellers the society as well by the developers and issue notice to the society also and hear them and pass appropriate speaking order within 3 months from today.	Decision
The above direction is issued in the larger interest of the slum dwellers and in order to rehabilitate the poor slum dwellers and needy slum dwellers at the earliest.	Decision
We place on record the very valuable assistance and guidance of all the learned senior counsel rendered to this Court and, in particular, the learned Solicitor General inviting our attention to the proper procedure, guidelines and conditions to be followed by SRA while granting the Letter of Intent to the Developer.38.	Decision
All the IAs are disposed off as above.	Decision
No costs.	Decision
