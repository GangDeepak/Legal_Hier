Facts
Dissatisfied with the order of acquittal passed by the High Court, the brother of the deceased informant filed the present appeals by way of special leave.10.	Issue
We have heard Shri Viswajit Singh, learned counsel for the appellant and Shri Ranjit Rao, learned Additional Advocate General for the State and Shri Pramod Swarup, learned senior counsel for the accusedprivate respondents herein.	None
Shri Vishwajit Singh, learned counsel for the appellant vehemently contended that the High Court committed a manifest and grave error in analyzing the evidences of PW1 and PW2 and acquitted the accused without proper application of mind.	Arguments of Petitioner
It ought not to have rejected the ocular evidence of the informant PW 1 Bhola Singh, the ultimate victim and father of the three deceased persons.	Arguments of Petitioner
The finding of the High Court that PW1 was not present on the spot is untenable and treating his evidence as unreliable, is totally perverse and bad in law in view of the true nature and circumstances of the case.	Arguments of Petitioner
A prudent analysis of evidence of PW1 would clearly suggest that there are no discrepancies in his evidence and rather it abundantly makes clear that he is a wholly reliable witness and his evidence is trustworthy.12.	Arguments of Petitioner
Similarly, the view expressed by the High Court that the presence of PW 2Baijnath Singh at the scene of occurrence is doubtful and it is an afterthought, cannot be sustained as perusal of FIR lodged by PW1 Bhola Singh unequivocally shows that the name of PW2 Baijanth Singh was referred in the FIR and his presence at the place of occurrence was established beyond any reasonable doubt.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, nothing has been elicited in his examinationinchief or crossexamination mounting a doubt on the veracity of his statement.	Arguments of Petitioner
Moreover, the witness has been consistent in his statement fully supporting the prosecution story.13.	Arguments of Petitioner
Lamenting on the view taken by the High Court in disregarding the abduction of Ganga Singh, the injured witness, learned counsel explained that Ganga Singh could not be produced in the witness box by the prosecution for the reason that he was kidnapped by the accused persons after being threatened and beaten up by them.	Arguments of Petitioner
In this regard, two FIRs, i.e. one on 6.10.1997 and before that another on 12.9.1997 were also lodged which would show that Ganga Singh was purposely kidnapped during the period when the evidence of the witnesses were going on and the High Court has wrongly mentioned that a photocopy of the final report would show that the allegation of kidnapping was fabricated and although no such document was either exhibited before the Trial Court or before the High Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, the timing of the aforesaid kidnapping and threatening also coincided with the fact that the statement of PW1 Bhola Singh was completed on 24.7.1997 and the statement of PW2 Baijnath Singh was completed on 13.11.1997.	Arguments of Petitioner
Regarding the minor inconsistency between medical and ocular evidence, it is argued that it cannot derail the case of the prosecution as the inconsistency is not of an extreme nature and weightage has to be given to the evidence of eyewitness as per settled law.	Arguments of Petitioner
Merely for the reason that no blunt injuries were found on the bodies, even when the complainant had alleged, is of no consequence.14.	Arguments of Petitioner
Negating the finding of the High Court as to the place of occurrence, learned counsel submitted that the High Court did not consider the case in its proper perspective.	Arguments of Petitioner
A perusal of entire evidence on record would clearly establish the place of occurrence and that the prosecution has succeeded in proving the guilt beyond all reasonable doubt.	Arguments of Petitioner
The evidence on record clearly reveals that the Investigating Officer had recovered the blood stained roll of the clay and the plain clay from the place of incident, which was sent for examination wherein on analysis, human blood was found on the same.	Arguments of Petitioner
Even the evidence of eyewitnesses PW1 Bhola Singh and PW2 Baijnath Singh is very much consistent on the said aspect and, therefore, the High Court was wrong to raise a dispute on the place of occurrence.	Arguments of Petitioner
Contending further on the doubt raised by the High Court on the timing of incident, learned counsel submitted that the High Court has laid a lot of emphasis on the presence of semidigested food in the medical report and has held that it totally contradicts the case of prosecution with regard to the time of occurrence of the offence, whereas the doctors (PWs 6 7) in their examinationinchief have clearly stated that the incident might have taken place at	Arguments of Petitioner
8 a.m.	Arguments of Petitioner
Thus the High Court erred in recording a finding contrary to the evidence, particularly for the reason that in villages generally people wake up early in the morning and start work early after having breakfast and, therefore, presence of halfdigested food cannot be a probable ground to arrive at a conclusion that the deceased must have died at night.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel finally submitted that for all the aforesaid reasons, the High Court ought not to have interfered with the wellreasoned judgment of the trial Court.	Arguments of Petitioner
In support of his submissions, learned counsel placed reliance on various authorities of this Court.15.	Arguments of Petitioner
The learned counsel for the State supported the contentions of the appellant and conceded that the High Court erred in acquitting the respondentsaccused ignoring certain relevant circumstances and material evidence which clearly established the guilt of the accused.	Arguments of Petitioner
According to him, the High Court has utterly failed to consider the genuine facts that the FIR was lodged at 9.15 a.m. immediately after the incident without any unreasoned delay, evidence of both the eyewitnesses i.e. PW1 AND PW2 were reliable as their statements were completely corroborated by the medical evidence the injured Ganga Singh though could not be examined by the prosecution but had been medically examined by PW6 on the same day corroborating the prosecutions story and the motive of the accused to commit the crime was established as they were having enmity with the victim party in respect of a land dispute.	Arguments of Petitioner
Learned counsel, therefore, prayed that considering the abundant and cogent evidence available on record, this Court should exercise its powers under Article 136 of the Constitution of India and set aside the impugned judgment and order by convicting the accused.	Arguments of Petitioner
Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the accused respondents submitted that the prosecution case is unreliable for the reasons that the place of occurrence and lodging of FIR is very much disputed, there is difference between the medical and oral evidence of the witnesses, the so called injured witness Ganga Singh despite being a relative of the informant, has not been examined before the Court and the presence of semidigested food in the stomach of the deceased suggests that the incident could have occurred between 2.00 to 4.00 a.m. totally controverting the stand taken by the prosecution.	Arguments of Respondent
The High Court has prudently appreciated these facts and rightly held that the investigation department was hand in glove with the complainant who wanted to implicate the accused in the alleged crime.	Arguments of Respondent
The alleged FIRs purporting to establish kidnapping story of Ganga Singh cannot be of any consequence as the same were concocted and was rightly disregarded by the High Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Moreover, from the statements of PW1 Bhola Singh and PW2 Baijnath Singh, it cannot be inferred that they were actually present at the scene of offence at the time of occurrence of the incident since their evidence does not support the same.	Arguments of Respondent
Disputing the scene of occurrence, learned counsel contended that as per prosecution version, all the three deceased were laying clay on the nand but PW4 Riyatullah Khan, who has prepared the panchnama had not found any clay on the deadbodies of the deceased nor in the postmortem no clay was found by PW7 Dr. Jitendra Kumar.	Arguments of Respondent
Another clinching factor in this regard is that the place of firing as shown in the sketch map prepared by the I.O. is contradictory to the place referred by PW1 and P.W.2.	Arguments of Respondent
in their statements.	Arguments of Respondent
The motive factor also stood not proved beyond reasonable doubt, considering the statement of PW1 who had categorically stated in his evidence that there was no dispute with regard to haudi and the land abutted to that.17.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel further contended that General Diary of the case has been prepared on the plain paper, contrary to the provisions of the Police Regulation Act.	Arguments of Respondent
Apart from this, entry of sending the case diary to the Superintendent of Police has not been made in the G.D., whereas under para 295(16) of the Police Regulation Act, it was necessary that the documents which are received in the G.D. in the police station, are sent to the police station after making entries thus the IO has not complied with the provisions of para 107 of the Police Regulation Act and due to this reason, the investigation is vitiated.	Arguments of Respondent
Learned counsel for the accused therefore strenuously urged that there is no error in the acquittal order passed by the High Court which does not call for any interference by this Court.	Arguments of Respondent
Generally, an appeal against acquittal has always been altogether on a different pedestal from that of an appeal against conviction.	None
In an appeal against acquittal where the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is reinforced, the appellate Court would interfere with the order of acquittal only when there is perversity of fact and law.	None
However, we believe that the paramount consideration of the Court is to do substantial justice and avoid miscarriage of justice which can arise by acquitting the accused who is guilty of an offence.	None
A miscarriage of justice that may occur by the acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent.	None
This Court, while enunciating the principles with regard to the scope of powers of the appellate Court in an appeal against acquittal, in the case of Sambasivan and Others V. State of Kerala, (1998) 5 SCC 412 , has held The principles with regard to the scope of the powers of the appellate Court in an appeal against acquittal are well settled.	None
The powers of the appellate Court in an appeal against acquittal are no less than in an appeal against conviction.	None
But where on the basis of evidence on record two views are reasonably possible the appellate Court cannot substitute its view in the place of that of the trial Court.	None
It is only when the approach of the trial Court in acquitting an accused is found to be clearly erroneous in its consideration of evidence on record and in deducing conclusions therefrom that the appellate Court can interfere with the order of acquittal.	None
This Court, in several cases, has taken the consistent view that the appellate Court, while dealing with an appeal against acquittal, has no absolute restriction in law to review and relook the entire evidence on which the order of acquittal is founded.	None
If the appellate Court, on scrutiny, finds that the decision of the Court below is based on erroneous views and against settled position of law, then the interference of the appellate Court with such an order is imperative.	None
This Court in Chandrappa V. State of Karnataka, (2007) 4 SCC 415 , after referring to a catena of decisions, has laid down the following general principles with regard to powers of the appellate Court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal From the above decisions, in our considered view, the following general principles regarding powers of the appellate Court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal emerge (1) An appellate Court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded.(2)The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power an appellate Court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law.(3) Various expressions, such as, substantial and compelling reasons, good and sufficient grounds, very strong circumstances, distorted conclusions, glaring mistakes, etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate Court in an appeal against acquittal.	None
Such phraseologies are more in the nature of flourishes of language to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate Court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the Court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion.(4)An appellate Court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused.	None
Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent Court of law.	None
Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial Court.(5)If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate Court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial Court.	None
Reason is the heartbeat of every conclusion, without proper reason the conclusion becomes lifeless.	None
Having carefully considered the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court as also that of the Trial Court and after perusing the records and giving anxious consideration to the facts of the case on hand in the light of wellsettled law, in our considered opinion the judgment of the High Court deserves to be set aside on the ground of lack of reasoning and for the following compelling and substantial reasons The High Court had taken a view that PW 1 Bhola Singh, father of the deceased (brother of the appellant before us) had changed his version at the time of second Chief Examination.	Reasoning
Upon giving our anxious consideration to the chronology of events, we find that after commencement of the trial, the evidence of PW1 was started on 9.8.1996 and the chiefexamination was concluded on 21.8.1996.	Reasoning
On 9.1.1997 the crossexamination was started and further on 29.5.1997 the second Examinationinchief was started as some of the accused had surrendered before the Court in the meanwhile.	Reasoning
Second time Examinationinchief was conducted on 29.5.1997 and ended up on 19.06.1997.	Reasoning
Second Crossexamination started on 17.07.1997 which was further conducted on 24.7.1997.	Reasoning
As seen from the various dates, the record indicates that the first chiefexamination of PW 1, which started on 09.08.1996, was concluded after completing the second crossexamination on 24.7.1997.	Reasoning
So, it is clear from the evidence of PW 1 itself that the examination and crossexamination had taken place several times in a piecemeal manner and the Court was forced to conduct the chiefexamination repeatedly because of the subsequent surrender of some of the accused persons.	Reasoning
While appreciating the evidence of PW1, the Courts must be conscious of the length of time consumed in recording the evidence of the prosecution witness.	Reasoning
From a perusal of the evidence of PW1, the High Court was of the opinion that there were discrepancies and deviations in the evidence of PW1.	Reasoning
In our considered opinion, the evidence of PW 1, who is an eyewitness who lost three sons in the fateful incident was consistent and there are no major deviations or discrepancies and if at all any minor discrepancies that occurred in the evidence of PW1 might have been due to the long gap between the date of incident and the long delay in examination, more so, those discrepancies are not material in bringing home the guilt of the accused, we find no reason whatsoever to disbelieve his evidence.	Reasoning
The statements of PW 1 are fairly corroborated by the statements of PW 2.	Reasoning
Hence, we are of the considered opinion that the occurrence had taken place in front of Baithaka of PW1Bhola Singh and he had witnessed the said occurrence along with PW2 Baijnath and the injured Ganga Singh.ii)	Reasoning
Similarly, we find no reason whatsoever to disbelieve the evidence of PW2 (brotherinlaw of PW1 Bhola Singh), another key eyewitness present at the time of incident.	Reasoning
A valiant attempt is also made by the defence to discredit his evidence that he is only a chance witness and not an eyewitness to the incident and his presence is doubtful.	Reasoning
But, nothing has come out in his examinationinchief or in crossexamination which creates a doubt on the veracity of his statement.	Reasoning
Moreover, he has been consistent in his version and fully supported the prosecution story.	Reasoning
However, his admission that at the time of panchnama, he has signed as suggested by the Darogaji and PW1 asked him as to whose names should be written and whose names should be left out in the panchnama, have to be seen in the context of preparing the panchnama and shall not be attributed otherwise to disbelieve his evidence.iii)	Reasoning
We are of the view that the High Court, for acquitting the respondents, had mainly relied upon the medical evidence in a very inappropriate manner.	Reasoning
When the doctor (PW 7) in his examinationinchief had categorically stated that the incident could have occurred at 8.00 a.m. which corroborated the case of the informant, there was no reason to disbelieve this fact to hold that the incident occurred between 2.00 to 4.00 a.m.	Reasoning
merely basing on a vague statement made by the Doctor in the crossexamination.	Reasoning
Also we believe that merely for the reason that no blunt injuries were present on the deceased, the whole evidence of PW 1 cannot be discarded as primacy has to be given to the ocular evidence particularly in the case of minor discrepancies.	Reasoning
This Court in Darbara Singh Vs. State of Punjab, (2012) 10 SCC 476 , wherein this Court has held .	None
So far as the question of inconsistency between the medical evidence and the ocular evidence is concerned, the law is well settled that, unless the oral evidence available is totally irreconcilable with the medical evidence, the oral evidence would have primacy.	Reasoning
In the event of contradictions between medical and ocular evidence, the ocular testimony of a witness will have greater evidentiary value visvis medical evidence and when medical evidence makes the oral testimony improbable, the same becomes a relevant factor in the process of evaluation of such evidence.	Reasoning
It is only when the contradiction between the two is so extreme that the medical evidence completely rules out all possibilities of the ocular evidence being true at all, that the ocular evidence is liable to be disbelieved.iv) We are also of the opinion that the place of occurrence is proved beyond doubt in the light of evidences of PW 1 (Bhola Singh), PW 2 (Baijnath), PW 3 (Constable Ram Manohar Maurya) and PW 4 (Riyayatullah KhanSub Inspector).	Reasoning
Apart from this, the investigating officer had recovered blood stained roll of the clay and plain clay from the place of incident (Ext.Ka8) and also had recovered cartridges from the place of the incident.	Reasoning
Even as per the forensic report human blood was found on the roll of clay (Ext.Ka37).	Reasoning
The aforesaid circumstance would clearly establish that the place of incident was the baithka of the informant and not the village pakvainar as alleged by the defence.v) Coming to the issue of nonexamination of the injured witness Ganga Singh, it is relevant to point out that the trial Court had appreciated the fact that though the prosecution had made an attempt to produce Ganga Singh, they failed to do so as he was kidnapped at the relevant period.	Reasoning
This stands proved by the registration of two FIRs dated 12.09.1997 and 06.10.1997 which establish the fact that Ganga Singh was threatened and kidnapped.	Reasoning
Therefore, nonexamination of injured Ganga Singh could not be fatal to the case of the prosecution and the same cannot be a ground to disregard the evidence of PWs 1 2.	Reasoning
Thus, no adverse inference can be drawn against the prosecution for not examining Ganga Singh, the injured witness Also see Rajan Rai v. State of Bihar, 2006(1) SCC 191.vi) As far as the nonexamination of any other independent witness is concerned, there is no doubt that the prosecution has not been able to produce any independent witness.	Reasoning
But, the prosecution case cannot be doubted on this ground alone.	Reasoning
In these days, civilized people are generally insensitive to come forward to give any statement in respect of any criminal offence.	Reasoning
Unless it is inevitable, people normally keep away from the Court as they feel it distressing and stressful.	Reasoning
Though this kind of human behaviour is indeed unfortunate, but it is a normal phenomena.	Reasoning
We cannot ignore this handicap of the investigating agency in discharging their duty.	Reasoning
We cannot derail the entire case on the mere ground of absence of independent witness as long as the evidence of the eyewitness, though interested, is trustworthy.vii)	Reasoning
It has been vehemently argued by the accused respondents that the prosecution has failed to establish any motive for the alleged incident.	Reasoning
However, the complainant had deposed about existence of land dispute between the parties and regarding the same complaints were made prior to the incident also.	Reasoning
The Trial Court had held that there was land dispute between the parties and for the same the complainant had made complaints to the police (Ext. Ka2 and Ka3).	Reasoning
We concur with the view of the Trial Court that the accusedrespondents had enmity with the complainant party over a land dispute and that Ext.Ka2 and Ka3, the complaints made prior to the incident, could not be an afterthought as both the exhibits bear signature and dates on which these were received by the police.	Reasoning
Thus, in the light of above discussion, it can be safely held that the accused respondents had strong motive to commit the offence against the complainant party.viii)	Reasoning
The High Court, while passing the impugned judgment and order, has failed to consider that the two respondentsaccused Ramashray Singh and Kamla Singh had not succeeded in proving their plea of alibi.	Reasoning
It is evident from the letter of Ministry of Defence addressed to the District Sessions Judge, Mau (Doc.263 Ka.) where it has been specifically mentioned that the accused Ramashray Singh and one Virender Singh (DW1) had been directed to proceed to Secunderabad from Pathankot on 4.9.1994.	Reasoning
It is mentioned that on 6.10.1994 said Virender Singh had deposited the fused missile and Ramashray Singh accused respondent was not present on the said date and he presented himself at Secunderabad on 11.10.1994.	Reasoning
As far as accused Kamla Singh is concerned, he had taken a plea of alibi stating that he was posted as a Hawaldar in Jammu.	Reasoning
However, he has failed to mark any evidence in this behalf.	Reasoning
Also it was stated by him that he was present at his quarter in Jammu.	Reasoning
However, DW4 Onkar Singh has stated that he, along with the accused Kamla Singh, had gone to Vaishno Devi but fails to prove the same by adducing cogent evidence.	Reasoning
Thus, on perusal of the material on record, we concur with the finding of the trial Court that the accused have failed to establish their plea of alibi.ix)	Reasoning
We are also of the considered opinion that the reasons given by the High Court to reverse the conviction and sentence of the accused are flimsy, untenable and bordering on perverse appreciation of evidence.x)	Reasoning
The trial Court has awarded death sentence to Ramashraya Singh and Kamla Singh.	Reasoning
On this issue, we are not able to concur with the view taken by the trial Court as the reasoning of the trial Court does not convince us that this is the rarest of the rare cases which warrants the penalty of death sentence.	Reasoning
For the aforesaid reasons, we reach to the irresistible conclusion that these appeals deserve to be allowed and the impugned judgment and order has to be set aside.	None
Accordingly, we allow these appeals by setting aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court and modify the judgment and order passed by the Trial Court by convicting all the accused respondents to life imprisonment under Section 302/149 IPC with a fine of Rs.10,000/. In default, they are directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months.	Decision
They are also convicted under Section 307/149 IPC and sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.5,000/.	Decision
In default, they shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months.	Decision
Conviction under Section 148 IPC is also recorded against the accused respondents and they are sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1,000/. In default, they have to undergo three months rigorous imprisonment.	Decision
All the sentences shall run concurrently.	Decision
