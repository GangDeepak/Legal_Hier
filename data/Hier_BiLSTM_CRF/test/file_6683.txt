Brief facts leading to the filing of these appeals are as underThe Board of Directors of SGL and of Ekaterina (a company based in Mauritius), in their respective meetings held on 25/02/2012 approved the concurrent scheme including the share exchange ratio.
On the same date the Board of Directors of SGL and of SIIL, MALCO, SEL and VAL, in their respective meetings approved the composite scheme and the share exchange ratio.
The approval of both the schemes was after considering the joint valuation report of M s. Grant Thornton India, LLP and KPMG India Private Limited, independent valuers and the Fairness Opinion Report of Citigroup Global Markets India Private Limited (given to the Board of Directors of SGL) and DSP Merrill Lynch Private Limited (given to the Board of Directors of SIIL) on 02/04/2012 and 12/04/2012, respectively.

The appellant filed his objections to the said schemes on various grounds.
The company petitions and objections raised by the appellant were extensively heard by the learned Company Judge and upon appraisal of the entire material on record, the learned Judge allowed the company petitions and rejected the objections of the appellant.
The said common judgment and order dated 3/4/2013 is impugned in the present appeals.5.
Section 391 of the Act provides as under391.
Power to compromise or make arrangements with creditors and members.(1) where a compromise or arrangement is proposed(a) between a company and its creditors or any class of them or(b) between a company and its members or any class of them the court may, on the application of the company or of any creditor or member of the company, or, in the case of a company which is being wound up, of the liquidator, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, or of the members or class of members, as the case may be, to be called, held and conducted in such manner as the court directs.(2)

The appellant as well as the SGL, amongst others, have relied upon the following cases in which the principles laid down, are as under(a) In the case of Miheer H. Mafatlal Vs. Mafatlal Industries Ltd. reported in 1996 (Vol. 87) Comp.
Cases, 792, in the matter of sanctioning the scheme of amalgamation, the Apex Court has held that the compromise or arrangement between the company and the creditors and members is the commercial wisdom of the parties to the scheme who have taken an informed decision about the usefulness and propriety of the scheme by supporting it by requisite majority vote that has to be kept in view by the Court.
The Court certainly would not act as a court of appeal and sit in judgment over the informed view of the parties concerned to the compromise as the same would be in the realm of corporate and commercial wisdom of the parties concerned.
The Court has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction to delve deep into the commercial wisdom exercised by the creditors and members of the company who have ratified the scheme by the requisite majority.
Consequently the Company Courts jurisdiction to that extent is peripheral and supervisory and not appellate.
The Court acts like an umpire in a game of cricket who has to see that both the teams play their game according to the rules and do not overstep the limits.
But subject to that how best the game is to be played is left to the players and not to the umpire.
The supervisory jurisdiction of the Company Court can also be culled out from the provisions of Section 392 of the Act.
Of course this section deals with postsanction supervision.
But the said provision itself clearly earmarks the field in which the sanction of the Court operates.
It is obvious that the supervisor cannot ever be treated as the author or a policymaker.
Consequently the propriety and the merits of the compromise or arrangement have to be judged by the parties who as sui Juris with their open eyes and fully informed about the pros and cons of the scheme arrive at their own reasoned judgment and agree to be bound by such compromise or arrangement.
The following are the broad contours of the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the Company Court enumerated by the Apex Court in the case of Miheer Mafatlal,(supra) which are stated to be illustrative and not exhaustive1.
The sanctioning court has to see to it that all the requisite statutory procedure for supporting such a scheme has been complied with and that the requisite meetings as contemplated by Section 391(1) (a) have been held.2.
That the scheme put up for sanction of the Court is backed up by the requisite majority vote as required by Section 391 subsection (2).3.
That the meetings concerned of he creditors or members or any class of them had the relevant material to enable the voters to arrive at an informed decision for approving the scheme in question.
That the majority decision of the concerned class of voters is just and fair to the class as a whole so as to legitimately bind even the dissenting members of that class.4.
That all the necessary material indicated by Section 393(1)(a) is placed before the voters at the concerned meetings as contemplated by Section 391(1).5.
That all the requisite material contemplated by the proviso to subSection (2) of Section 391 of the Act is placed before the Court by the concerned applicant seeking sanction for such a scheme and the court gets satisfied about the same.6.
That the proposed scheme of compromise and arrangement is not found to be violative of any provision of law and is not unconscionable, nor contrary to public policy.
For ascertaining the real purpose underlying the Scheme with a view to be satisfied on this aspect, the court, if necessary, can pierce the veil of apparent corporate purpose underlying the scheme and can judiciously xray the same.7.
That the Company Court has also to satisfy itself that members or class of members or creditors or class of creditors, as the case may be, were acting bona fide and in good faith and were not coercing the minority in order to promote any interest adverse to that of the latter comprising of the same class whom they purported to represent.8.
That the scheme as a whole is also found to be just, fair and reasonable from the point of view of prudent men of business taking a commercial decision beneficial to the class represented by them for whom the scheme is meant.9.
Once the aforesaid broad parameters about the requirements of a scheme for getting sanction of the Court are found to have been met, the Court will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the commercial wisdom of the majority of the class of persons who with their open eyes have given their approval to the scheme even if in the view of the Court there could be a better scheme for the company and its members or creditors for whom the scheme is framed.
The Court cannot refuse to sanction such a scheme on that ground as it would otherwise amount to the Court exercising appellate jurisdiction over the scheme rather than its supervisory jurisdiction.(b)
In the case of Hindustan Lever and another Vs. State of Maharashtra and another reported in (2004) 9 SCC 438 , the Apex Court reiterated the said contours and further observed as under12.
Two broad principles under lying a scheme of amalgamation which have been brought out in this judgment are1.
that the order passed by the court amalgamating the company is based on a compromise or arrangement arrived at between the parties and2.
that the jurisdiction of the Company Court while sanctioning the scheme is supervisory only i.e. to observe that the procedure set out in the Act is met and complied with and that the proposed scheme of compromise or arrangement is not violative of any provision of law, unconscionable or contrary to public policy.
The Court is not to exercise the appellate jurisdiction and examine the commercial wisdom of compromise or arrangement arrived at between the parties.
The role of the court is that of an umpire in a game, to see that the teams play their role as per rules and do not overstep the limits.
Subject to that how best the game is to be played is left to the players and not to the umpire.
Both these principles indicate that there is no adjudication by the court on the merits as such.(c)
In the case of Bedrock Ltd. reported in 1998 (4) Bom.
C.R. 710, it has been held that a party seeking discretionary relief from the Court must come with clean hands must not suppress any relevant fact from the Court must refrain from making misleading statements and from giving incorrect information to the Court and that such conduct of the party is sufficient to entail an outright dismissal of the petition without going into the merits.(d)
In the case of T. Mathew Vs. Smt.
Saroj G. Poddar reported in (1996) 22 CLA Section II, 200 , it has been held that one who comes to the Court must come with clean hands and that this position is well settled in S. P. Chengalavarya Naidu V s. Jagannath AIR 1994 SC 853 wherein, inter alia, it is observed that the courts of law are meant for imparting justice between the parties that one who comes to the court must come with clean hands and that it can be said without hesitation that a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to approach the court and he can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation.9.
Mr. Chagla, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1 submitted that before proceeding to deal with the objections raised by the appellant, it would be advisable to look into his conduct and bona fides.
He vehemently urged that the present appeals require something more than dismissal as there is lack of bona fides suppression of material facts and an attempt to mislead the Court, which ought not to be encouraged.
He submitted that the appellant has not approached with clean hands.
The learned Counsel pointed out that the appellant has filed Writ Petition No. 840/2012 before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay for enforcement of Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO) report and for other reliefs, which is still pending.
He further submitted that the appellant has filed Civil Suit no. 69 of 2012 before the District Court, at PanajiGoa, based on the SFIO report, for a direction to the Registrar of Companies, Goa to delete the name of SGL from the register maintained by his office, for recovery of money and other reliefs, in which even interim relief for stay of amalgamation proceedings was asked for.
He pointed out that in the Company Petitions, the judgment was reserved on 08/02/2013 but the said suit no.
60 of 2012 was filed before the District Judge on 07/12/2012 which shows that there is suppression of material facts.
He submitted that the above facts have been suppressed from this Court and also they were suppressed from the Company Court.
According to SGL, the material fact of filing of the said Writ Petition and Civil Suit has been suppressed with ulterior motive and malafide intention and with an attempt to procure orders from this Court.
Learned Counsel pointed out that the appellant and his family members have increased their equity shareholding in SGL by purchasing additional shares after the court convened meeting of SGL and still the appellant says that the scheme is bad and detrimental to him and others.
He submitted that the present appeals are filed with ulterior motive and that there is no ground for challenge of the impugned judgment and order.
Learned Senior Counsel submitted that it is well settled that when a person comes with unclean hands, he is not entitled to any relief.
In this regard, he relied upon Bedrock Ltd. and Smt.
Saroj G. Poddar (supra).
The appellant, in answer, submitted that the said Writ Petition and the Suit have no corelation with the issues raised in the present proceedings.
According to him, by the Writ Petition, he is trying to enforce the recommendations in terms of filing prosecutions under Indian Penal Code against delinquent officers of SGL and the Suit pertains to a contract that had been entered into by SGL in terms of buying shares of its erstwhile subsidiary viz Sesa Industries Ltd. and both do not come in the way of amalgamation proceedings.
The Writ Petition No. 840/2012 was filed in or around April 2012 by the minority shareholders of SGL, including the appellant praying therein inter alia for a direction to the respondents therein to file proceedings under relevant provisions of Indian Penal Code and the Companies Act, on the basis of SFIO reports dated 29/4/2011, against the persons named therein and to reimburse the funds siphoned away from the Company (a mention of which is made in the reports dated 29/4/2012 of SFIO), back into its books.
In Suit No. 69/2012, filed in December 2012, the appellant and his family members have, inter alia, prayed for direction to the Registrar Of Companies to take action against SGL under the relevant provisions of the Companies Act and to delete the name of SGL from the register and to restrain SGL from amalgamating or merging itself with any other company or voluntarily winding up itself, pending the hearing and final disposal of the suit.
The learned Company Judge had reserved the Judgment in Company Petitions on 8/2/2013 and had sanctioned the schemes of amalgamation by order dated 3/4/2013.
One of the objections taken by the appellant is that SFIO report, wherein siphoning of more than Rs. 1,000 crores has been discovered, was not considered by valuers.
In our considered opinion, there is no merit in the submission canvassed by the appellant that the said Writ Petition and the Suit have no corelation with the issues raised in the present proceedings.10.
The learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL further submitted that the appellant and his family members who had opposed the sanctioning of the concurrent scheme, represented only 0.17 in number and 0.01 in value of the Equity shareholders present and voting at the Court convened meetings held on 19/6/2012 and insofar as composite scheme is concerned, they represented only 0.43 in number and 0.01 of the value of the Equity Shareholders present and voting at the court convened meeting held on 19/6/2012.
Learned Senior Counsel then pointed out that the appellant and his family members have now purchased approximately 10,000 shares of SGL and have thus increased their equity shareholding in SGL after the Court convened meetings of SGL.
Relying upon Hindalco Industries Limited, In re reported in (2009) 151 Comp.
Cases 446 (Bom), learned Counsel, submitted that the appellant lacks bonafides.
The appellant, on the other hand, submitted that he and his family members had sold more than 50,000 shares of SGL before the announcement of amalgamation and that they deal in stocks and shares on a regular basis and since the value of the shares of SGL plummeted post announcement of amalgamation and further once the appellant on reading the Explanatory Statement and on ascertaining the other facts of the case was convinced that the present amalgamations could never pass the test of law, they repurchased approximately 10,000 shares of SGL, which were available at discount rate of Rs.
60/ per share.
According to the appellant, frivolous arguments have been advanced by SGL only to prejudice this Court.
Nobody trades into the shares knowing that they would ultimately go into loss.
When it is the case of appellant that the schemes of amalgamation are detrimental to the minority shareholders and only the promoters and majority shareholders would stand to gain and when he wants that the schemes should not be sanctioned, purchasing of shares of SGL after amalgamation is contrary to the above case and prayer.
In case of the appellant and his family members who claim to be dealing in stocks and shares, who sold more than 50,000 shares prior to the announcement of amalgamation, again purchasing 10,000 shares of the same company after amalgamation is all the more conspicuous and this certainly reveals lack of bona fides.
In the case of Hindalco Industries Ltd.(supra), the second objector had only one share of the petitionercompany.
He participated in the meeting and registered his objection.
But the resolution was passed with overwhelming majority.
On the one hand, he objected to the proposed scheme and on the other hand, after the meeting of the Equity Shareholders, he purchased additional 50 Equity Shares of the petitionercompany and that reflected his bona fides.
Learned Company Judge held that no prudent person who had opposed the proposed scheme would think of acquiring additional shares of the same company.
No doubt, It was observed that the fact that the objector possessed only one share on the relevant date does not mean that he is denuded of his right of raising objection.
However still, substance was found in the stand taken by the petitionercompany that the complaint filed by this objector was not bona fide.
It has been held that the person who has not approached with clean hands and have traded in the shares of the target company, cannot be heard to make grievance about the scheme.
Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that there is a serious doubt about the bona fides of the appellant in challenging the Scheme.11.
We now proceed to deal with the objections raised by the appellant, on merits.12.
The appellants first objection is that there is violation of the provisions of Section 391 of the Act, on account of following (a) the schemes have been modified twice firstly after the valuation was done and placed before the shareholders for approval and secondly after the filing of the Company Petitions in the Court (b) the report of SFIO was not placed before the Company Court and hence there was violation of the proviso to Section 391(2) of the Act (c) since one of the members who had allegedly cast a vote in favour of the scheme had died long back, there was misrepresentation of the shareholders of SGL (d) the majority of the minority shareholders who were present and who had voted in the Court convened meetings had opposed the schemes and (e) the majority of the Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) who held shares in SGL had voted against the scheme.
His second objection is that the valuations are skewed and predetermined.
In this regard, he has contended as follows (a) SFIO report has discovered siphoning of more than Rs. 1,000/ crores but the same has not been considered by the valuers (b) the valuers had considered the valuation of Cairns India Ltd.(CIL) and its associated debt but CIL is not part of merger which shows that there is modification (c) Scheme that had been approved by the shareholders have been modified inasmuch as SGL has undertaken to take over Residual VALs liabilities (d) the principles of the methodologies applied by the valuers whilst valuing the schemes and more specifically the Price of Recent Investment(PRI) methodology insofar as the valuation of VAL is concerned, has been most incorrectly applied by the valuers (e) the subsequent developments in terms of the complete stoppage of operations at VAL post December, 2012 i.e during the course of the hearing of the present Petitions by this Court have completely rendered the valuations arrived at by the valuers as otiose (f) the nondisclosure of many of the contingent liabilities of the transferor companies in their balance sheets have also rendered the valuations arrived at by the valuers as meaningless (g) the valuations arrived at by the valuers only benefit the promoters of SGL at the cost of its minority shareholders (h) the valuations arrived at by the valuers are arithmetically incorrect inasmuch as the shares of SIL have been valued differentially while valuing the said Company and whilst valuing the same as an investment made by another transferor company viz.
MALCO and (i) the valuations arrived at by the valuers were predetermined inasmuch as the merchant bankers were already having draft reports of the schemes which were prepared at least two days prior to the issuance of the valuation report.
Even the report submitted by the parent company of SGL to the London Stock Exchange was based on information that was gathered by it one day prior to the valuation report.13.
The next objection is that there is violation of the provisions of Section 393 of the Act inasmuch as (a) SFIO report was not shown to the shareholders despite being available with SGL (b) the fairness opinion reports were not disclosed in the Explanatory Statement despite an undertaking given by SGL to the National Stock Exchange(NSE) and (c) Misleading statement made by SGL in the Explanatory Statement to the effect that the financial position of SGL would not be adversely affected if Ekaterina was merged into it.
The fourth objection is that there is violation of Public Policy and Public Interest because of following (a) SFIO report exhibits the fact that the affairs of SGL have been managed by its management in a manner contrary to public policy and public interest(b) the schemes mooted by SGL are a colourable device inasmuch as by the said schemes SGL and SIL are trying to claim refund of the taxes paid by them for yester years owing to the accumulation of the losses accrued in the other transferor companies which would then be transferred into the books of SGL and claiming of tax refunds otherwise is impermissible in law (c) there is no element of public interest in the schemes mooted by SGL inasmuch as by the said schemes the interests of the minority shareholders of SGL would be severely affected.
The fifth objection is that the schemes mooted by SGL are completely unconscionable in nature inasmuch as onthe sanction of the same, SGL would be reduced to a debt laden status having no means to cater to the said debt and would thus be in no capacity to churn out any profits for distribution amongst its minority shareholders but the promoters of SGL would be relieved of the said debt and the responsibility to service the same.
Sixth and the last objection of the appellant is that the schemes of arrangement have been proposed by SGL so as to somehow circumvent the action that is required to be taken by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on the recommendations made by SFIO in its report since once a sanction is accorded by a Court to a scheme, it is presumed that the companies amalgamating were managing their affairs in a manner not prejudicial to their respective shareholders.14.
The appellant has relied upon the following judgments(a) Vodafone International Holdings BV Vs Union of India and another.

Per contra, it is the contention of learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL that it is well settled that a Company Court is not expected to sit in appeal over the commercial wisdom of the majority shareholders of the company who have given their seal of approval to the schemes of amalgamation.
The court is expected to act as an umpire and dispassionately consider whether the procedure which is laid down under the section has been followed meticulously, fairly and impartially and proper opportunity is given to all shareholders and the creditors of the company to ensure that sanction and approval is not obtained by suppression of material facts or that a decision is contrary to the interest of minority shareholders or creditors.
It is submitted that the contours of the jurisdiction of the Company Court whilst sanctioning the scheme of amalgamation have been laid down by the Apex Court.
Learned Counsel invited our attention to paragraphs 27, 28 and 29 of the judgment in the case of Miheer Mafatlal paragraphs 3, 4 and 6 of the judgment in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees Union Vs.
Hindustan Lever Ltd. and others (AIR 1995 SC 470 ) and paragraphs 11, 12, 13, 18 and 32 of the judgment in the case of Hindustan lever and another(supra).
It is submitted that in the present case, the concurrent and composite schemes have been approved by the equity shareholders of SGL in accordance with the mandate of Section 391(2) of the Act and in accordance with the well settled position of law.
According to the learned Counsel for SGL, there is no impediment to the sanction of the schemes in view of the following facts(a) SGL has complied with the statutory procedures under the Act and the Rules and the requisite meetings as directed by the Court have been convened(b)
The scheme has been approved by majority of the equity shareholders in terms of Section 391(2) of the Act(c) All relevant material as stipulated by Section 391 of the Act was provided to the equity shareholders and or made available for inspection as to enable the equity shareholders to arrive at an informed decision on the scheme(d) The scheme is not violative of any provisions of law and is not contrary to public policy(e)
The scheme is just, fair and advances the interest of SGL and their shareholders and stakeholders.16.
Mr. Chagla, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent no.1, further submitted that the petitioner has argued all the objections before this Appellate Court as if these are original Petitions.
He pointed out that almost all the objections which are now taken by the appellant before this Court were taken before the Company Court and havebeen dealt with by the said Court.
He submitted that the judgment in the case of Miheer Mafatlal (supra) and Hindustan Lever (supra) were cited before the learned Company Court and have been duly considered by it.
It was therefore submitted that no interference is called for.17.
Mr. Ferreira, the learned Assistant Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the respondent no. 2, submitted that the respondent no. 2 has no role to play in these proceedings.18.
According to the appellant, the valuers who have arrived at swap exchange ratio and the merchant bankers who have ascertained the fairness of the said valuation, have considered the valuation in terms of transfer of 38.8 stake in Cairn India Ltd.(CIL) from one of the subsidiaries of Vedanta Resources Plc.
viz Twin Star Energy Holdings Ltd.(THEL) into one of the 100 subsidiaries of SGL along with the associated debt of 5,924 million.
It is the contention of the appellant that this fact has been acknowledged by SGL in paragraph 25 of the SurSurRejoinder, filed by it on 6/10/2012 read with a chart which is a part of Exhibit Jcolly to the affidavit in rejoinder of SGA dated 13/9/2012.
It is contended that the figures of SGL in respect of revenue, EBITDA and cash and current investment post the merger as mentioned therein correspond axiomatically with the figures stated in the said chart annexed to the rejoinder dated 13/9/2012, which aptly demonstrate the inclusion of financials related to CIL whilst arriving at the said figures of revenue, EBIDTA and cash and current investments of SGL, post merger.
It is further submitted that the above fact is clear from the valuation report dated 24/2/2012 of Grant Thornton and KPMG India Pvt. Ltd., wherein according to the appellant, at page 1, the valuation of Twinstar Holding Ltd., which is not a part of the amalgamating companies has been considered.
It was pointed out that at page 7, the valuers have used the word transaction whilst qualifying that they have not, by the said valuation, addressed the relative merits of the said amalgamation and that the word transaction as defined in the Fairness Opinion Reports include the valuation of CIL.
The appellant further submitted that in the valuation report dated 24/2/2012, at page 8, the words proposed restructuring, which include the proposed schemes of amalgamation as also the inclusion of CIL and its associated debt, have been used whilst qualifying the report.
It is further submitted that the merchant bankers (DSP Merrill Lynch and Citygroup), in their Fairness Opinion Reports, have mentioned that CIL and Cairns Forecasts have been considered by them whilst appreciating the valuation report dated 24/2/2012.
The appellant canvassed that in the statutory report filed by Vedanta Resources Plc with London Stock Exchange, the entire scheme of amalgamation and the valuations conducted by SGL in respect thereto have been laid out in detail and CIL being part of the said valuations has been expressly stated in the said report.
The appellant submitted that SGL whilst seeking approval of the proposed schemes from its shareholders as also from the Company Court varied the terms of the said schemes inasmuch as the original valuations arrived at by the joint valuers in respect of the companies forming part of the said schemes included the valuation of 38.8 stake in CIL and its associated debt whereas CIL was ultimately excluded from the gamut of companies forming a part of the proposed amalgamation and hence the swap exchange ratio arrived at by the joint valuers was rendered meaningless in terms of the said modification rendered to the proposed schemes that were placed for approval before the shareholders of SGL and also before the Company Court.19.
Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL, during the course of arguments, made it clear that the Fairness Opinion dated 25/2/2012 of Citigroup Global Markets India Limited, which is at page
no.
163A Set IV has been inadvertently filed before the Court.
He submitted that the opinion dated 25/02/2012 given by Citigroup Global Markets India Private Limited relied upon by the appellant is not for merger but for purchase of CIL.
As pointed out by him, the said opinion finally says that based upon and subject to the foregoing, the experience of the Citigroup Global Markets India Private Limited, as Investment Bankers, their work as described above and other factors deemed relevant by them, they are of the opinion that as on the date mentioned in the report, the consideration is fair, from financial point of view to the SGL.
Learned Senior Counsel submitted that the said 38.8 stake of cairn was to be purchased and that was a totally independent transaction.
He further submitted that 20.1 of CIL was taken as investment in valuation.
He submitted that said transfer of Vendantas direct holding of 38.8 in CIL to Sesa Goa was not a condition to the merger.
According to him, the statement in the Affidavit in Sur Sur Rejoinder dated 6/10/2012, filed by SGL, with regard to CIL is read out of context.
A perusal of the said opinion of Global Markets India Pvt. Ltd., pointed out by the appellant, reveals that it is in respect of the acquisition of the shares of CIL and has nothing to do either with the concurrent scheme or the composite scheme.
With regard to the acquisition of CIL, it is seen that in the press release note issued by SGL on 25/2/2012, on Allshare Merger of Sesa Goa and Sterlite Industries, and Vedanta Group Consolidation, on of the transaction highlights is mentioned as transfer of Vedantas direct holding of 38.8 in CIL to SGL, together with the associated debt of 5.9 billion, at cost and that post the transfer, Sesa Sterlite will have a 58.9 shareholding in Cairn India.
Further, one of the proposed transaction steps has been stated as followsVedanta will transfer its 38.8 direct shareholding in Cairn India to a whollyowned subsidiary of Sesa Goa at a nominal consideration of 1, together with the associated acquisition debt of 5.9 bn (through the transfer of companies in which such debt and shareholdings are held).
The debt will continue to be guaranteed by Vedanta.
This transfer is not interconditional on the merger of Sesa, Sterlite, MALCO and VAL.Thus, it can be said that transfer of Vedantas direct holding of 38.8 in CIL to Sesa Goa, is an independent transaction.
At page no. 3 of the joint valuation report dated 24/2/2012 of Grant Thornton and KPGD India Pvt. Ltd., with regard to proposed restructuring, it is specifically mentioned that the relative valuation of the equity shares of SGL, SIIL, MALCO and Ekaterina has been carried out with a view to arriving at a fair share exchange ratio of the equity shares of SIIL, MALCO and Ekaterina for the equity shares of SGL.
At page no. 6 of the said report, it is mentioned that the Price of Recent Investment (PRI) approach has been considered in cases where an investment transaction has taken place recently or the company has been acquired recently.
It is stated that in such case the cost of such investment acquisition has been considered as the fair market value and that PRI has been used to derive value of SGLs investments in CIL.
In view of the above, there is force in the submission of Mr. Chagla, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of SGL that the 38.8 stake of CIL is not the subject matter of the valuation report dated 24/2/2012 prepared by joint valuers and that what has been considered is only the investment in CIL.20.
The appellant further submitted that as per clause 3.3 of Chapter III of the Scheme in Company petition No. 12 of 2012, Residual VAL was supposed to take care of his own liabilities and the petitionerCompany was not required to own any liabilities of Residual VAL.
The appellant submitted that in spite of above, in paragraph 3 of the affidavit dated 02/10/2012 filed by the petitionerCompany in Madras High Court it has been stated that all contractual legal remedies including appellate remedies by Residual VAL shall be discharged by the amalgamating company to the extent that the Residual VAL is entitled to discharge the same.
As provided in the composite scheme, the aluminium business of VAL will be demerged and transferred into SGL whereas Residual VAL will operate the power undertaking.
In terms of Clause 3.3 of Chapter 6 of the Composite Scheme, in Company Petition No. 12/2012, Residual VAL which concerns the power business of VAL and MALCO (post merger), was supposed to take care of its own liabilities and SGL would in no circumstances be required to honour any liabilities of Residual VAL towards its secured unsecured creditors.
However, in an affidavit filed by SGL before the Madras High Court in Company Petition No. 167/2012, filed by VAL, SGL has undertaken to discharge the liabilities of Residual VAL to the extent Residual VAL was unable to discharge the same.
On account of the above, it is the contention of the appellant that SGL has expressly modified the terms of the schemes of amalgamation, after having sought the approval from its shareholders.
We find that there is absolutely no substance in the above objection of the appellant on alleged modification of the schemes.
Insofar as, the affidavit filed before the Madras High Court, is concerned, the learned Counsel on behalf of SGL, submitted that the said undertaking given to the Court cannot be held as modification of the scheme.
We agree with the learned Counsel, because, admittedly, there is no amendment moved to the Court for modification of the scheme.
What is stated in the affidavit is postmerger and about taking over all liabilities post amalgamation.
This point has been elaborately considered by the learned Company Judge.
The learned Judge has observed that a perusal of the affidavit discloses that in order to give comfort to the Residual VAL which would become subsidiary of the amalgamated Company and to give assurance to its creditors that they would be taken care of, it was stated that after the scheme was sanctioned if the Residual VAL was not in a position to repay the debts of its creditors, in that event the said debts would be paid by the amalgamating company.
Even otherwise, as pointed out by the learned Senior Counsel, as per the clause 3.3.1 of the scheme of Residual VAL, all the assets, liabilities and obligations pertaining thereto shall continue to belong to and be vested in and be managed by VAL.
Clause 3.3.2 (ii) mentions that if proceedings are taken up against SGL in respect of the matters referred to in subclause 1(i) above, it shall defend the same in accordance with the advice of VAL and at the cost of VAL, and the latter shall reimburse and indemnify SGL against all liabilities and obligations incurred by SGL in respect thereof.21.
There can be no dispute that the procedural requirements of Section 391 of the Act must be satisfied before the Court can consider the acceptability of a scheme.
Section 392 of the Act only gives power to the Court to make such modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it may consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or arrangement and this cannot be understood as a power to make substantial modifications in the scheme approved by the members in a meeting called in terms of Section 391 of the Act.
In the present case there is no violation of the provisions of Section 391 of the Act, as there is no modification of the schemes as alleged by the appellant.
Reliance placed by the appellant in the cases of M s. Meghal Homes Pvt. Ltd. and Bengal Bank Ltd.(supra) is misplaced.
As pointed out by Mr Chagla, the learned Senior Counsel, in paragraph 11 of the judgment in the case of M s. Meghal Homes Pvt. Ltd.(supra), the Apex Court has observed that the Division Bench had allowed the appeals, set aside the judgment of the Company Court and sanctioned the scheme as modified and as further modified during the course of hearing before the Division Bench, by way of two affidavits filed by the Director of Lodha Builders Pvt.
Ltd.
and therefore the said scheme with modification had to go back to the General Meeting of the members, called in accordance with Section 391 of the Act and for obtaining requisite majority.
Therefore, the judgment of the Apex Court in the case supra is clearly distinguishable.
The learned Company Court, in paragraph 34 of the impugned judgment, has distinguished the facts of the present cases with those in Meghal Homes Pvt. Ltd.(supra).
There is no modification of the schemes in the present cases.
The ratio of the judgment in case supra is not applicable to the facts of the present cases.
In the case of Bengal Bank Ltd., a scheme was sanctioned by the majority under Section 153(2) of the Companies Act, 1913.
But that scheme was modified by the Reserve Bank.
The changes were substantial and not just nominal.
It was held by the Calcutta High Court that if a scheme has been sanctioned under Section 153(2) of the Companies Act and that scheme has not been certified as it is, but has been modified by the Reserve Bank and that modified scheme is presented to the Court for confirmation, without being sanctioned as required under Section 153(2), the Court has no jurisdiction to grant sanction to such a scheme.
No such thing has happened in cases before us.
Hence, the case of Bengal Bank Ltd.(supra) is also not applicable.22.
In view of the discussion supra, the contention of the appellant that there is violation of the provisions of Section 391 of the Act inasmuch as SGL has modified the schemes with regard to CIL and that CIL is considered for valuation therefore there was modification to the proposed schemes before seeking approval of the shareholders of SGL as also before the Company Court and further that the schemes have been modified after filing the petitions before the Company Court in view of affidavit filed in Madras High Court, is without legal sanctity, and liable to be rejected.23.
Further, for the same reasons as above, the contention of the appellant that since the scheme had been valued by considering the valuation of CIL and its associated debt though CIL is not part of merger, due to which the scheme is modified and therefore the joint valuation is skewed and predetermined, has no force.
Similarly, the submission that since Residual VALs liabilities have been undertaken by SGL, the scheme stands modified and hence the joint valuation is skewed and predetermined, has also no merit.24.
The appellant submits that there is violation of the provisions of Section 391(2) of the Act inasmuch as SGL has suppressed the SFIO report which pertains to the investigation regarding SGL under Section 235 of the Act, from the Company Court as well as the shareholders.
According to the appellant, SGL has misled them by making false statements in the Explanatory Statement thereby driving them to take an uninformed decision.
It is contended that despite being in possession of the SFIO report, SGL failed to even refer to the same in the Explanatory Statement but on the contrary made a statement that the investigation before the SFIO was pending.
Thus, the appellant submitted that there is violation of the provisions of Section 393 of the Act.
It is further the contention of the appellant that SFIO report, dated 29/4/2011, wherein a siphoning of more than Rs. 1,000 crores has been discovered, has not been considered by the valuers, and therefore the valuation is skewed, predetermined, disproportionate and belies even the methodologies used by the valuers and such ratios cannot be imposed upon the minority shareholders of SGL by sanctioning the schemes.
It is also a contention of the appellant that the said SFIO Report exhibits the fact that the affairs of SGL have been managed by its management in a manner contrary to public policy and public interest since the said siphoning of amount of more than Rs. 1,000 crores is in respect of iron exports of iron ore which is a national wealth.25.
As far as the SFIO report dated 29/4/2011, is concerned, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL, submitted that the said report had not culminated into prosecution and had to go to the Central Government for approval.
He submitted that the said report was only provisional and therefore not required to be disclosed.
The learned Counsel further submitted that in spite of the same being provisional, SGL had disclosed to the National Stock Exchange that there was investigation.
He submitted that it was for National Stock Exchange to raise objection, if any, about the nondisclosure of the SFIO Report.
He also stated that in the Explanatory Statement as also in the Company Petition filed before the Company Court, SGL had disclosed the pendency of the proceedings, before the SFIO, under Sections 235 to 251 of the Act.26.
A perusal of the Explanatory Statement dated 19/5/2012 reveals that there is reference to the pending investigation.
It is further mentioned in this Statement that any voter could take inspection of the document referred to in this Statement, by visiting Companys office.
According to the appellant there was no investigation pending since SFIO had already submitted its report dated 29/4/2012.
But the said report, unless approved by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, could not have attained finality.
SGL had sent its representations against the allegations made in the said provisional report.
The learned Company Judge has observed that it is quite well settled that even if the report is filed and if any action has to be taken, further investigations have to be done for the purpose of taking recourse to criminal proceedings and the report has to be filed in the Court.
Therefore, merely because the word pending has been used in the Explanatory Statement, it cannot be said that there is suppression of material fact and an attempt to mislead the equity shareholders.
We do not find anything wrong in the above observations made by the Company Court.
Be that as it may, the said SFIO report could not have come in the way of amalgamation, since Company remains and the erring directors, officers, etc of SGL would be subject to the consequences that would arise from that report.
During the course of arguments, the appellant had fairly conceded that the SFIO report is not relevant and does not come in the way of sanction of the schemes.
Hence, there cannot be any need to file the SFIO report along with the Company Petitions for sanction of Schemes.
The appellant had himself filed the report along with his reply to the Petition.
According to the appellant, though the SFIO report was with him, however, the same was not with any other shareholder.
As has been rightly contended by the learned Senior Counsel for SGL, the other equity shareholders had not raised any objection regarding non disclosure of SFIO report.27.
The joint valuation report is dated 24/2/2012.
The valuers, in the letters dated 9/1/2013 and 14/1/2013, have specifically mentioned that they had received the copy of SFIO report dated 29/4/2011 and representations made by SGL to the Secretary, Ministry of corporate Affairs in response to the SFIO report and that they have considered the information provided by SGL including the SFIO report while recommending the swap exchange ratio vide joint swap letter dated 24/2/2012 and that this should be read along with the joint swap letter dated 24/2/2012.
These letters were produced by SGL before the learned Company Court.
Besides the above, there are subsequent events.
The SFIO has prepared another report after considering the representations and submissions sent by SGL to the Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, thereby explaining the stand of SGL on the allegations made in SFIOs report and denying those allegations.
In the fresh report, it is stated that had these representations been there prior to the preparation of the first report, then the conclusions in that report would have been different with regard to under invoicing, over invoicing and other aspects and these conclusions would have been in favour of SGL.
By letter dated 10/5/2013, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has stated that they have advised SFIO not to file prosecution against SGL, for alleged violations.28.
Therefore, there is no merit in the objection raised by the appellant, regarding the alleged suppression of the SFIO report dated 29/4/2011 from the shareholders or the Company Court or about the alleged nonconsideration of the same by the joint valuers.
Further, the contention of the appellant that the joint valuation is skewed since the valuers have not considered the alleged siphoning of more than Rs. 1,000/ crores disclosed in the SFIO report dated 29/4/2012, has also no merit at all.
There is also no substance in the allegation that there is violation of public policy and public interest, since alleged siphoning of huge amount was in respect of national wealth i.e. iron ore.29.
Next contention of the appellant is that in the only methodology that could apply for arriving at the valuation of Ekaterina as per the valuation report submitted by the joint valuers was the PRI methodology since neither the Company Ekaterina is a listed Company nor does it have any positive net asset value and also it does not have any positive cash flow for any other methodologies, used by valuers to arrive at the valuations, to apply to Ekaterina.
According to the appellant, Ekaterina had valued the shares of VAL at the rate of Rs. 16.50/ per share as on 24/2/1012 whilst issuing its own shares in exchange for the acquisition of shares of 70.50 stake in VAL from other subsidiaries of Vedanta Resources Plc.
It is further stated that this was the most recent investment made by any company in the shares of VAL.
It is contended that despite making a categorical statement that the cost of any such investment made by the said amalgamating companies has been considered by the valuers as fair value, however, the valuers have on the same day valued the shares of VAL at Rs. 27.
60/ per share thereby completely defying the application of their methodology in terms of PRI.
It is therefore contended that the entire valuation report is untrustworthy and unreliable.
It has been further contended that the valuers have arithmetically arrived at some absurd valuations and swap exchange ratios.30.
With regard to the above difference between the value of VAL shares at Rs. 16.50 per share by Ekaterina and the value of VAL at Rs. 27.60/ per share arrived at by the Jointvaluers for the amalgamation, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL submitted that the comparison is wholly incorrect since the prior transfer of VALs share from the said subsidiaries of Vedanta Resources Plc, namely Twinstar Holdings Ltd. and Welter Trading Ltd. to Ekaterina was a transfer amongst the holding Company and wholly owned subsidiaries and no one else was concerned.
It was not a market value but a notional value and therefore, not required to be at a fair value.
It is contended that the jointvaluers had arrived at a valuation of VAL based on the inherent value of VALs shares, in determining the share exchange ratio which was based on factors stated in the joint valuation report.
swap value was Rs. 27.60/ and that was relevant.31.
Learned Company Judge has observed that the above submissions of the objector (appellant) are nothing but conjectures and surmises and the own opinion of the objector in respect of the valuation and fairness report and his own analysis as to how the swap ratio which is arrived at by the valuers is incorrect.
The Company Court has observed that there is no material on record to show that minority shareholders would suffer by this ratio whereas the promoters would stand to gain, since this ratio is applicable to all the equity shareholders without making any exception either in respect of promoter shareholders or any other category of equity shareholders.
The valuers were not before the Company Court.
There may not be any provision in the Act enabling the objector to propose an amendment to the scheme in the Court convened meeting, but he can very well produce his own valuation report prepared by some experts, for showing that the valuations considered for schemes were not correct.
In the present cases in addition to Joint valuation report prepared by experts, there are fairness opinion reports prepared by other experts stating that the share exchange ratio as arrived in the joint valuation report is fair.
Therefore the appellant cannot be heard to say that the valuation is skewed since the methodology insofar as the valuation for VAL is concerned, has been incorrectly applied.32.
It is further submitted by the appellant that the balance sheets of VAL and SEL (which are the transferor companies in the present schemes of amalgamation) have not shown, either in the liability and or the contingent liability heads, many of the claims of persons who are the creditors of the said companies (some of whom had also sought to intervene in the present proceedings).
According to the appellant, the claims of such persons which amounted to more than Rs. 2,000 crores do not reflect in the financial statements of any of the aforesaid amalgamating companies.
Thus, the appellant says that the valuers as also the merchant bankers who have assessed the said valuation report whilst giving their opinion have not been able to assess such hidden claims against the amalgamating companies and have therefore been misled whilst arriving at their respective valuations of either of these companies.
This, according to the appellant, renders the said valuations a nullity.
Learned Counsel for SGL, in answer to the above, has alleged that there has been necessary disclosure of the contingent liabilities of the transferor companies in their audited financial statements and the joint valuers have appropriately considered these contingent liabilities.
We have serious doubts whether contingent liabilities need to be taken into account.
Even otherwise, in this regard, a perusal of the joint valuation report dated 24/2/2012 at its page no. 6, reveals that based on the information made available to the valuers, contingent liabilities as on the date of valuation have been considered.
Thus, there is no force in the contention of the appellant that the joint valuers and the merchant bankers have been misled whilst arriving at the valuation.
The valuation report cannot be held to be skewed on such ground.33.
It is then contended by the appellant that the valuations arrived at by the valuers and affirmed by the merchant bankers only subserve the interests of the ultimate promoters of Vedanta Resources Plc. and enriches them at the cost of minority shareholders of SGL.
According to the appellant, a perusal of the charts disclose that the relative holding of the minority shareholders in SGL would come down from 100 to 29.30 whereas the relative holding of the promoters of Vedanta Resources Plc. would increase from 55.1 to 58.3 and the relative holding of the minority shareholders of SGL in VAL and SEL(financially sick companies) go up from 0 to 29.30 whereas that of the promoters in VAL would come down from 87.60 to 58.30, if the present schemes of amalgamation are sanctioned.
Therefore, according to the appellant, the entire scheme is so orchestrated that the ultimate promoters of Vedanta Resources Plc. gain at the cost of the minority shareholders of SGL and the liabilities of the transferor companies(especially that of VAL, SIIL and SEL) which at present are the sole responsibilities of either of the said companies and or the ultimate parent company viz.
Vedanta Resources Plc. is shifted and transferred to SGL much to the detriment of its minority shareholders.
Indisputably, the valuers namely KPMG India Pvt. Ltd. and Grant Thornton India LLP have independently worked on the analysis of the swap exchange ratio and then have arrived at a consensus swap ratio.
Thereafter the merchant bankers namely Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, have assessed the joint valuation report and opined that the Exchange Ratio provided for in the Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Sterlite Shareholders and the merchant bankers
namely Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt. Ltd. have assessed the said joint valuation report and opined that the Exchange Ratio is fair from a financial point of view to SGL.
The capabilities and also bona fides of the valuers and the merchant bankers have not been challenged.
As submitted by the learned Counsel for SGL, the swap exchange ratio arrived at by the joint valuers is equally applicable to all classes of the shareholders, without making any exception either in respect of promoter shareholders or any other category of equity shareholders.
The learned Company Judge has observed that there is no material on record to show that minority shareholders would suffer whereas the promoters would stand to gain by the ratio.
There is no convincing reason for us to differ from the said view of the Company Court.34.
The appellant has further contended that the valuers have even arithmetically arrived at some absurd valuations and swap exchange ratios for some transferor companies and that the said valuations even mathematically do not tally with the swap exchange ratios arrived at by them for inter related transferor companies that contain identical nature of shares as that of companion transferor companies.
The appellant, by way of an example, has taken the valuation of the shares of SIIL and MALCO.
During the course of arguments, the appellant sought to explain by figures as to how the valuers have allegedly arrived at absurd valuations.
According to him, there is a difference of approximately Rs. 2,619 crores in the valuation of the shares of Sterlite Industries Ltd., if the swap exchange ratios arrived at by the valuers for the shares of SIIL and MALCO(which essentially is an investment company and holds 3.56 in the shares of Sterlite Industries Ltd.) with SGL are considered on their standalone basis.
In this regard, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL rightly submitted that the two values cannot be compared as the valuation of the joint valuers based on the market price as contained in balance sheet as on 31/03/2012 is not relevant to a valuation done on 24/02/2012.
It is the contention of SGL that the inherent value of SIIL as on the date of valuation was considered and has been set out in the joint valuation report and not the market price as of 31/03/2012.
In the case of Hindustan Lever Employees Union(supra), it has been observed that the jurisdiction of the Court in sanctioning a claim of merger is not to ascertain with mathematical accuracy if the determination satisfied the arithmetical test.
It has been observed that the Company Court exercises a jurisdiction founded on fairness and is not required to interfere only because the figure arrived at by the valuer was not as better as it would have been if another method would have been adopted.
What is imperative is that such determination should not have been contrary to law and that it was not unfair for the shareholders of the company which was being merged.
It has been further held that the Courts obligation is to be satisfied that valuation was in accordance with law and it was carried out by an independent body.
In the present cases, it is not the case of the appellant that the valuers were not independent.35.
The appellant submitted that a bare perusal of the contents of the Fairness Opinion Reports reveals that a draft scheme of amalgamation between the transferor companies along with CIL and SGL was already prepared and was in existence as on 22/2/2012 i.e. even before the swap exchange ratio arrived at by the valuers was known to anybody.
The appellant submitted that the valuers had filed their valuation report on 24/2/2012.
He pointed out that it is qualified in the Fairness Reports that the final terms of the scheme of merger ought not to materially vary from those set forth in the draft or else the opinion Report would not stand good.
It is further contended by the appellant that from the records it is clear that the ultimate promoters of SGL also knew the swap exchange ratio that was yet to be arrived at by the valuers at least a day in advance i.e. on 23/2/2012 since while making the representation at the London Stock Exchange, Vedanta Resources Plc.
whilst declaring the swap exchange ratios to London Stock Exchange categorically stated that the information contained in the said representation was as on 23/2/2012.
Therefore, according to the appellant, the said ratios were predecided predetermined.
In this regard, Mr. Chagla, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL submitted that the draft report which is mentioned in the Fairness Report of 25/2/2012 is the draft scheme of amalgamation and arrangement and there has been no predetermination of the valuation report as alleged.
What should be understood to have been stated by the merchant bankers in this Fairness Report is that the representatives of the Vedanta Group have advised them and they have further assumed that the final terms of the scheme of arrangement will not vary materially from those set forth in the draft scheme of amalgamation.
It is seen, as rightly pointed out by learned Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL, that the report which is at pages 406407 of set II mentions the date of 24/2/2012.
This report was uploaded on 27/2/2012 after the Board had approved the scheme on 25/2/2012.
Hence, there is nothing wrong in the observation of the learned Company Court that merely because the date 23/02/2012 has appeared in one of the documents, on the basis of that date it is not possible to arrive at the conclusion that prior to the approval given by the Board of Directors, swap ratio was already known on 23/02/2012.36.
Relying upon the principles of valuation laid down in the cases of Miheer Mafatlal Hindustan Lever Employees Union Smt Saroj G. Poddar and Larsen and Toubro (supra), the appellant contended that the valuations conducted and the swap ratios arrived at, apart from being unfair, unjust, predetermined and to the disadvantage of the shareholders of SGL, was a result of incorrect and suppressed financial data being supplied to the valuers thereby resulting into a fallacious exchange ratio being reached by them and further that the same included financial data of companies which do not form part of the present scheme merger.
According to the appellant in any event, the subsequent events that have transpired during the pendency of the present proceedings have made the swap exchange ratios so arrived at by the valuers merchant bankers meaningless and otiose.37.
What is settled in view of the above judgments is that unless material is shown and produced on record to show that the valuation, as done, was unfair or contrary to the record or material, the Court has no reason to interfere with such experienced opinion in proceedings like these.
In the present case, instead of himself producing material in the form of valuation done by some other experts in the field of accountancy, before the Company Court, for understanding as to how the report of joint valuers was unreliable, the appellant wanted the Company Court to appoint fresh valuers at his cost in the event the Court was of the opinion that it could not go into the conclusion reached by the expert valuers.
we accept the submission made by Mr. Chagla, learned Senior Counsel for SGL that swap value is for the valuers to evaluate and the same is not an exercise that the Court would embark upon.
Valuation cannot be the job of Counsel for the parties or even of the Court as the same requires expertise.
It is a complex technical problem which should be left to the consideration of experts in the field of accountancy.
It was pointed out by learned Counsel for SGL that the petitioner is not a Chartered Accountant whereas the renowned Chartered Accountants have carried out the valuation and in addition to the said valuation there are fairness reports given by internationally acclaimed groups of Chartered Accountants in accordance with the SEBI regulations.
No mala fides have been attributed against these valuers.
The method of valuation is not challenged.
Nothing had prevented the appellant to engage any expert valuer and to show the discrepancies.
Mr. Chagla, learned Counsel, pointed out that even in the present appeals the appellant has not produced any report of the expert valuer and on the contrary the appellant is asking the Court to send the matter for fresh valuation.
He further submitted that the said valuers are not here for crossexamination.
Almost all the same contentions on valuation and fairness opinion reports, canvassed before this Court, were raised before the Company Court which has held that the submissions are nothing but conjectures and surmises and the own opinion of the Objector (appellant) in respect of valuation and fairness report and his own analysis as to how the swap ratio which is arrived at by the valuers, is wrong.
We do not find any error in the above finding.38.
A Company Court does not exercise an appellate jurisdiction.
It exercises a jurisdiction founded on fairness.
It is not required to interfere only because the figures arrived at by the valuer were not as better as it would have been if another method would have been adopted.
What is imperative is that such determination should not have been contrary to law and that it would not unfair for the shareholders of the company which was being merged.
The Courts obligation is to be satisfied that valuation was in accordance with law and it was carried out by an independent body.
There is no dispute that the joint valuers were independent experts.
Their bona fides have not been challenged.
There is no merit in the submission of the appellant that the Company Court ought to have appointed a valuer from the panel of valuers to ascertain the correct valuations of the companies involved in the schemes of amalgamation.
We do not see any reason to interfere with the valuation arrived at by the joint valuers.39.
According to the appellant, there was misrepresentation of the share holders of SGL inasmuch as at least one of the members namely Mr. Bimal S. Gandhi, who had allegedly cast a vote in favour of the scheme, had died a decade ago.
The appellant submitted that the counting of such a vote squarely breaches the provisions of Section 391(2) of the Act.
He expressed fear that many more such invalid votes might have been counted or that there may be many other discrepancies.
In this regard, learned Senior Counsel for SGL submitted that the shareholding of said late Mr. Bimal was under transmission pursuant to the request of Ms. Ramila Gandhi, the mother of late Bimal, who on 9/5/2012 sought issuance of duplicate certificates.
Ms. Ramila executed a proxy to vote at the Court convened meeting though that transfer had not taken effect.
The shares of Bimal have thereafter been transmitted in favour of Ms. Ramila Gandhi.
It was submitted that the mother of the late Bimal had wrongly voted and even if the said 12800 shares are deducted from the voting result, the Concurrent scheme stands approved by 92.31 in number and 79.07 in value present for the meeting and voting and in respect of Composite scheme stands approved by 91.70 in number and 79.12 in value present and voting.
The above approval by requisite majority even after excluding invalid vote of Ms. Ramila, has not been denied.
We are inclined to believe that it was by sheer inadvertent mistake that Ms. Ramila executed a proxy to vote.
The fact remains that even if the said vote is not considered, the schemes stand approved by 3/4th majority of the shareholders.
Fear of the appellant that there might have been many such invalid votes has no legal basis and is nothing but an imagination.40.
Another contention of the appellant is that if the majority vote of the promoters of SGL, which comprises 55.13 of the total issued and subscribed capital of SGL, is excluded from the counting of the votes of persons who have allegedly voted in favour of the scheme, then both the schemes have miserably failed to garner the support of the minority shareholders of SGL and only 18 of the shareholders present and voting had cast their votes in favour of the schemes in terms of the value of their votes and 82 of the shareholders had cast their votes against the sanctioning of the schemes.
Thus, according to the appellant, majority of the minority shareholders have voted against the schemes.
According to the appellant, considering the above facts, the Petitions for amalgamation ought to have been dismissed.
The appellant also submitted that most of the FIIs have voted against the schemes.
In the case of Re Hellenic and General Trust Ltd.(supra), relied upon by the appellant, it has been held that when the vendors meet to discuss and vote whether or not to accept the offer, it is incongruous that the loudest voice in theory and the most significant vote in practice should come from the wholly owned subsidiary of the purchaser.
The Apex Court in Miheer Mafatlal(supra), with reference to the above decision of the English Court, observed that the said decision is a pointer to the fact that what was required to be considered while sanctioning the scheme was the bona fides of the majority acting as a class and not of one single person.
The said decision of the English Court in the case of Hellenic and General Trust Ltd.(supra), has been followed in the case of Bedrock(supra).
There can be no dispute that unless a separate and different type of scheme of compromise is offered to a subclass of a class of creditors or shareholders otherwise equally circumscribed by the class, no separate meeting of such subclass of the main class of members or creditors is required to be convened.
In the present case, as submitted by learned Senior Counsel for SGL, no separate scheme was offered to the subclass of shareholders which would require separate meeting.
Both the schemes had offered the same compromise or arrangement to all the equity shareholders and hence one class meeting of equity shareholders was convened to consider the concurrent scheme and composite scheme.
There was only one class of equity shareholders, whether promoter, or public or minority which class had been treated identically by the schemes.
The same share exchange ratio was applicable to all its equity shareholders and there was no benefit to the promoters of SGL, at the cost of minority shareholders.
The objection of the appellant to the manner in which the FIIs voted both in favour of and against the scheme, has no merit in view of Section 183 of the Act which provides that on a poll taken at a meeting of a Company, a member entitled to more than one vote, or his proxy, or other person entitled to vote for him as the case may be, need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast in the same way all the votes he uses.
The learned Company Judge, in paragraph 31 of the impugned Judgment, has dealt with this objection.
In the circumstances above, the case of Hellenic and General trust Ltd.(supra), is not applicable here.41.
According to the appellant, as of today all manufacturing businesses of VAL relating to alumina and aluminium have come to a halt and this eventuality has occurred in the interregnum period i.e. from the time the present schemes of amalgamations had been announced proposed and till the time the same are being heard in the various Courts of law.
The appellant submitted that such a financially disastrous development which occurred during the interregnum period ought to have been looked into by the Company Court so that the minority shareholders of SGL are not emburdened with any unnecessary hardship despite the knowledge of the Company Court of such an eventuality.
Relying upon the observations of the Division Bench of Gujarat High Court in paragraph 13.3 of the judgment in the case of Satyesh James Parasad and Others(supra), the appellant canvassed that the Company Court could not have turned blind eye at such subsequent development.
With regard to the above subsequent development as alleged, SGL has made it clear that the said stoppage of the operation of the alumina refinery of VAL in Lanjigarh is a temporary suspension due to lower availability of bauxite.
It has been further stated that the operation of the aluminium smelter is going on and in January 2013 to March 2013 the production was approximately 1,33,000 MT as against corresponding quarter in the financial year 20112012 which was approximately 1,15,000 MT.
It is further pointed out by SGL that the fourth quarter production was 16 higher than corresponding quarter in the financial year 20112012.
In view of the above, there is no substance in the fear of the appellants that the minority shareholders of SGL would be emburdened with unnecessary hardship.42.
The appellant submitted that there is violation of the provision of Section 393 of the Act as the Fairness Opinion Reports were not disclosed in the Explanatory Statement despite an undertaking given by SGL to the National Stock Exchange.
In this regard, SGL has stated that the above objection is without any merit, in terms of the NOC dated 02/4/2012 of the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
A disclosure is found to have been made in the Explanatory Statements dated 19/5/2012 with respect to the concurrent as well as composite scheme that the share exchange ratio was approved by the Board of Directors of SGL after considering the Valuation Report and Fairness Opinion Reports.
It is further found stated in the said Explanatory Statements that the Valuation Report and the Fairness Reports are available for inspection.
According to SGL, the same were also been placed on the website of SGL at Sesagoa.com.
Hence, there is no force in the contention of the appellant that the Fairness Opinion Reports were not disclosed in the Explanatory Statements.43.
The appellant submitted that there is a completely false and misleading statement made by SGL in the Explanatory Statement by saying that the financial position of SGL would not be prejudicially affected if Ekaterina was amalgamated into it.
According to the appellant, the affidavit dated 6/10/2012 filed by SGL reveals that the net worth of VAL which is the only investment of Ekaterina as on 31/3/2012 was in the negative by a sum of Rs. 1938 crores and thus the financial position of SGL would admittedly deteriorate if Ekaterina(whose only asset is 70.50 stack of VAL) was amalgamated into it much to the converse of what had been stated by SGL in the Explanatory Statement issued to its shareholders.
In this regard, it is specifically stated in the Fairness Opinion Report dated 25/2/2012 given by Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt.
Ltd. that as more fully described in the scheme of amalgamation, Ekaterina, a company incorporated in Mauritius as an indirect 100 subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Plc and which will own 70.5 equity ownership in VAL will be merged with and into SGL and pursuant to the merger, 0.04 fully paid up equity shares, par value Rs. one per share, of SGL will be issued to the shareholders of Ekaterina for every one fully paid up equity share par value US 0.1 per share of Ekaterina held by the shareholders of Ekaterina.
Thus net worth of Ekaterina was positive due to its 70.5 equity holding of VAL as a whole (including residual VAL).
Hence, it is not correct to say that a false and misleading statement was made by SGL in the Explanatory Statement made to the shareholders.
Therefore there is no violation of the provisions of Section 393 of the Act, on this ground.44.
According to the appellant, the present schemes have been mooted under the influence of the ultimate promoters of the said companies and only for two purposes.
The first motive is to somehow hive away VAL from the books of Vedanta Resources Plc,.
so that it is relieved from the guarantees and other undertakings given by it for the said company.
The appellant submitted that the element of public interest includes the shareholders interest.
He further submitted that Vedanta Resources Plc. has given its own corporate guarantees for the loans of approximately Rs. 34,500 crores amassed by VAL which in turn has also taken loans worth Rs. 2,900 crores (which are included in the total figure of Rs. 34,000 crores), either directly and or indirectly from Vedanta Resources Plc.
It is the submission of the appellant that since the operations of VAL have come to a stand still and since VAL is now on the verge of an impending default both on its principle repayments as also on its interest payments, the present schemes have been mooted so as to hive away all the obligations that are likely to accrue owing to the default of VAL onto the shoulders of the minority shareholders of SGL thereby completely tramping upon the interests of the minority shareholders of SGL.
The second motive, according to the appellant, is that the present schemes are being used as device by the amalgamating companies so that the losses accumulated in VAL and Sterlite Energy Ltd. over the last few years (not just the previous year) could be adjusted against the profits made by SGL and SIIL and thus the taxes paid by these profit making companies with the exchequer can be reclaimed as refunds on account of offset of losses incurred by the aforesaid two companies.
The appellant pointed out that the appointed dates for each of the amalgamating companies are 1/04/2012 for Ekaterina 1/04/2011 for SIIL Effective date of Sanction for MALCO 1/01/2011 for Sterlite Energy Ltd. and 1/04/2011 for VAL( Aluminium business).
According to the appellant, as per the Income Tax Act and more particularly Section 72(A), the companies involved in an amalgamation proceedings can merge their accounts from the previous preceding year from which the amalgamation was effected i.e. the date of sanction.
Reliance has been placed by the appellant on paragraphs 17, 45 and 46 of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Mcdowell company Ltd.(supra) and paragraphs 68, 69 and 70 of the judgment of Apex Court in Vodafone International Holding BV (supra), for his contention that colourable devices cannot be a part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage the belief that it is honourable to avoid payment of taxes by resorting to dubious methods.
Relying upon Wood Polymer Ltd.(supra), the appellant contended that companies do not amalgamate for the fun of it and they must amalgamate or would like to amalgamate or may be amalgamated to achieve some purpose or object and such purpose must have some correlation to public interest.
He read out relevant portions of page no.
622 of the above citation for understanding the meaning of the expression Public Interest , as given by the Gujarat High Court in the judgment in Wood Polymer Ltd.(supra).The appellant submitted that it is a settled principle of law that what cannot be done directly is not permitted to be done indirectly.
Therefore, according to the appellant, the schemes are both against public policy and against public interest.45.
There is no material produced by the appellant, on record, to show that either SGL or the companies which are parties to the composite scheme have defaulted in repayment of loans or advances received from the financial institutions.
The joint valuers, who are experts, cannot arrive at the share exchange ratios without considering all relevant factors including the debts and liabilities, along with the assets.
It should be kept in mind that the said swap ratios have been assessed and approved by expert merchant bankers and the same have been duly approved by the majority of the equity shareholders.
The allegations of the appellant appear to be based on his surmises.46.
Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL, on the other hand, relied upon Section 72A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which provides for carrying forward and setting off of accumulated loss and unabsorbed depreciation allowance in amalgamation or demerger, etc He submitted that it is clear from paragraphs 147 to 149 of the judgment of the Apex Court in Azadi Bachao Andolan(supra)
paragraph 45 of Mcdowell and company Ltd.(supra) and paragraphs 68 to 70 of Vodafone International Holdings BV that it cannot be said that all tax planning is illegal illegitimate impermissible.
Tax planning may be legitimate provided it is within the frame work of law.
Every attempt at tax planning cannot be held to be illegitimate though the evasion of tax by use of colourable devices and by resorting to dubious methods and subterfuges is not permissible.
The learned Company Judge has observed that even after a scheme is sanctioned, it is always open for the tax authorities to scrutinize returns and issue notices.
The learned Judge, in paragraph 40 of the impugned judgment, has reproduced paragraphs 147 to 179 of the judgment of the Apex Court in Azadi Bachao Andolan(supra) and in paragraph 43 of the impugned judgment, paragraph 68 of the judgment in Vodafone International Holdings BV(supra).
Learned Judge has observed that the judgment of the Gujarat High Court in the case of Wood Polymers Ltd.(supra) is no longer good law.
The learned Company judge has held that it cannot, therefore, be said that the scheme is against the public policy.
There is no ground shown to us by the appellant to differ from the findings given as above by the learned Company Judge.47.
According to the appellant, the present schemes are of unconscionable nature and the interest of the minority shareholders of SGL has been completely overlooked.
He pointed out that as per Clause III(12) of the memorandum of association of SGL, it is entitled to enter into arrangement and or amalgamation with any other person concern so as to carry out or engage in any business which would directly indirectly be beneficial to it.
He submitted that the present schemes neither directly nor indirectly benefit the interests of SGL but on the contrary they tremendously deteriorate the financial condition of SGL and turn it into a negative figure apart from inflating its debt to unmanageable levels.
The contention of the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of SGL, in this regard, is that the net worth of SGL would, in fact, increase from Rs. 12,910.8 crores to Rs.
36,923.63 crores, post merger, thereby making the minority shareholders of SGL richer by three folds(100) and hence the schemes could never be termed as unconscionable.
Learned Company Judge has observed that the financial position of all the companies as per their audited accounts as of September, 2012 needs to be taken into consideration and from these figures, it can be said that after amalgamation, position of SGL would dramatically increase even after absorbing the socalled loss making companies.
The Company Judge has observed that when entrepreneurs take commercial decisions, it is not open for the Court to judge their commercial wisdom.
It is observed that when entrepreneurs take a commercial decision, their is always an element of risk and businessmen take such calculated risk after taking into consideration various facts and circumstances and pros and cons of all situations.
The company Judge has further observed that it has been consistently held that the court is not expected to dissect and conduct a postmortem of such decisions which are based on business experience and commercial wisdom.
The Court has to examine the scheme on well settled parameters.
The Court is expected to be an umpire and is not expected to enter into arena and examine the scheme under a microscope.
Whenever decisions are taken there is bound to be some kind of variation in the situation in respect of the functioning of both companies.
This should not deter the Court from granting sanction to the schemes.
The above observations of the learned Company Judge are based on the well settled principles laid down by the Apex Court in various cases.
The contention that the schemes are unconscionable has no merit.48.
The appellant lastly submitted that the proposed scheme of amalgamation is a ruse to stifle further action required to be taken by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in terms of report dated 29/4/2011 compiled and filed by the SFIO.
According to the appellant, once the present schemes are sanctioned by the Company Court, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs would refrain from initiating any action against the delinquent management of SGL as has been the case in respect of a prior amalgamation of Sesa Industries Ltd. with SGL wherein despite the damning findings against the managements of the said companies in the said SFIO report, the SFIO, in its supplementary report, had refrained from taking any action on the ground that both the said companies have been amalgamated and therefore the action that was required to be taken against the misdeeds of either of them has lost its relevance in the wake of amalgamation.
Insofar as the above, contention is concerned, the said provisional SFIO report dated 29/4/2011 had not culminated into prosecution and had to go to the Central Government for approval.
SGL had made representations to the Secretary, Ministry of corporate Affairs in response to the said SFIO report.
The SFIO then prepared another report after considering said the representations and submissions sent by SGL to the Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, thereby explaining the stand of SGL on the allegations made in SFIOs report and denying those allegations.
In the fresh report, it is stated that had these representations been there prior to the preparation of the first report, then the conclusions in that report would have been different with regard to under invoicing, over invoicing and other aspects and these conclusions would have been in favour of SGL.
By letter dated 10/5/2013, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has stated that they have advised SFIO not to file prosecution against SGL, for alleged violations.
There is therefore no force in the submission of the appellant that the schemes are a ruse to stifle the further action that was required to be taken by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in terms of the recommendations made in the SFIO report dated 29/4/2011.49.
We make it clear that though we have not referred to each and every judgment relied upon by the parties, however, we have considered the principles laid down in each of them.50.
Taking over all view of the matter, we are of the considered view that all the statutory requirements were complied with.
The schemes do not violate any of the provisions of the Act and also do not violate any principles of natural justice and cannot be termed as against public policy and public interest.
We do not find any infirmity in the impugned Judgment.
The objections have been rightly rejected by the learned Company Judge and the schemes have been sanctioned by applying the settled principles laid down by the Supreme Court.
Therefore, no interference is called for.
The appeals deserve to be dismissed and hence are dismissed.
Needless to mention that the applications for interim relief also get dismissed, accordingly.
No order as to costs.
