 Shah, J.1.
The firm of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons consisted of four partners Navinchandra Mafatlal, Arvind N. Mafatlal, Yogindra N. Mafatlal and Hemant Bhagubai.
The respective shares of the four partners in the profits and assets of the firm were five annas, three annas, three annas and five annas.
The firm was registered under the Indian Incometax Act.
The firm owned forty shares of a private limited company, Mafatlal Apte and Kantilal, Ltd., registered under the Phaltan State Companies Act.
having its registered office at Sakarwadi in the former Phaltan State.
Out of these forty shares, ten shares stood in the name of Navinchandra Mafatlal, ten shares stood in the name of Arvind N. Mafatlal and the remaining twenty shares stood in the name of Hemant Bhagubai minor by his guardian Mrs. Sharda Bhagubai.
Mafatlal Apte and Kantilal, Ltd., which will hereafter be referred to as the Company, were the Managing Agents of Phaltan Sugar Works, Ltd., which was also a Company registered under the Phaltan State Companies Act, having a factory at Phaltan.
In the former Phaltan State the Indian Incometax Act, 1922, was adopted almost verbatim by the Phaltan Incometax Act III of 1941 as amended by the Phaltan Incometax Act VIII of 1942.
Navinchandra Mafatlal, whom I will hereafter refer to as the assessee, was, as regards the Phaltan State Incometax Act, a nonresident.
The company held its General Meeting on 11th March 1946, and before the General Meeting the accounts for the year ending 30th September, 1945, were placed for adoption.
The accounts showed a profit of Rs. 1,09,165/ for the year ending 30th September, 1945, but no dividend was declared by the Company.
On the profit the Company paid Rs. 34,114/ as incometax and Rs. 6,823/as supertax and the net profit remaining with the Company was Rs. 68,228/.2.
After the merger of the Phaltan State, by S. 7 of the Taxation Laws (Extension to Merged States and Amendments) Act LXVII of 1949 the Phaltan State Incometax Act III of 1941 stood repealed, except for purposes of levy, assessment and collection of incometax and supertax in respect of any period not included in the previous year for the purposes of assessment under the Indian Incometax Act, 1922, as extended to the Phaltan State by S. 3.
By S. 3 of that Act, the Indian Incometax Act, 1922, and several other Acts and the Rules made thereunder, which were in force immediately before the commencement of the Act in the dominion of India were extended to the territory of the former Phaltan State as from 1st April, 1949.3.
On 17th March, 1951, the Incometax Officer, Satara North, passed an order under S. 23A of the Indian Incometax Act directing that theundistributed portion of the assessable income of the Company of the previous year ended on 30th September, 1945, as computed for Incometax purposes for the assessment year 194647 and reduced by the amount of incometax and supertax payable by the Company in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the shareholders as at the date of the General Meeting held on 11th March, 1946.The Incometax Officer then issued notice under S. 23 (2) of the Indian Incometax Act against the assessee for assessing him as a nonresident for incometax on interest and dividend deemed to have been received in Phaltan State for the year ending 31st December, 1946.
In answer to that notice the constituted Attorney of the assessee appeared before the Incometax Officer and contended that the shares of the Company, which stood in the name of the assessee, were in reality the property of the firm of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons, Bombay, and that the shares were standing in the assessees name as a nominee of the firm.
It appears that the Incometax Officer accepted this contention and determined the assessees total world income at Rs. 19,75,328.
In this total world income were included Rs. 18 as interest on deposits in Phaltan State and Rs. 8,528 being the five annas share in the dividend of Mafatlal Apte and Kantilal Ltd., deemed to have been distributed under S. 23A of the Incometax Act from the profits of that Company for the year ended 30th September, 1945, received through Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons.
The total income in the Phaltan State was, therefore, computed as Rs. 8,546.
The amount of Rs. 8,528, which was taken as the share of the assessee in the dividend of the Company, was presumably arrived at by the Incometax Officer as 5/16th of the dividend on forty shares held by Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons out of a total of 100 shares of the Company in respect of which the net income of Rs. 68,228 was deemed to have been distributed as dividend under S. 23A of the Indian Incometax Act.4.
On 13th April, 1954, the Incometax Officer, North Satara, served a notice upon the assessee intimating that the dividends deemed to have been distributed under S. 23A in respect of the shares of the company held by the assessee had been takenat Rs. 8,528 net for the assessment year 194748 under the Phaltan State Incometax Act without being grossed up though the credit for the tax deemed to have been paid thereon had been given, and as that was a mistake apparent from the record the Incometax Officer intended to rectify the same under S. 35 of the Incometax Act, and called upon the assessee to submit his objection to the mistake being so rectified.
By letter, dated 19th April, 1954, it was contended on behalf of the assessee that the order, dated 26th October, 1951, assessing the assessee under S. 23 (3), was itself ultra vires and illegal and no rectification could be sought thereof.
By another letter, dated 13th September, 1955, it was contended on behalf of the assessee that the original action taken under S. 23 (3) was ultra vires and illegal, that in any event in the order passed under S. 23 (3) the amount of capital gains of Rs. 9,38,011 for computing the tax payable by the assessee under the Phaltan State Incometax Act could not be included in the total world income, that similarly the Indian dividend income could not be grossed up by adding the tax payable thereon and that no case for rectification of a mistake under S. 35 of the Incometax Act was made out.
By his order dated 12th October, 1955, the Incometax Officer rejected the contentions raised by the assessee and he purported to rectify the mistake referred to in his notice, and ordered that an amount of Rs. 3,876, being the tax deemed to have been paid on behalf of the assessee, be added to the total world income.
Accordingly he held that Rs. 19,79,204 was the total world income of the assessee for the year 194748, and ordered that demand notice and chalans for excess tax, incometax and supertax, payable thereon be issued.
This order of rectification was served on the legal representatives of the assessee  whom I will hereafter refer to as the petitioners, the assessee having died on 7th November, 1955.
On 28th November, 1955, the Attorneys of the petitioners called upon the Incometax Officer to treat the order, dated 12th October, 1955, as void and a nullity and to intimate accordingly.
A similar communication was also made to the Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay South, and the Secretary, Ministry of Finance.
On 5th June, 1956, the Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay South, informed the petitioners that the Central Board of Revenue declined to interfere in the matter.
The petitioners then applied by this petition for a Writ in the nature of Certiorari or an appropriate writ under Art. 226 of the Constitution, quashing the assessment and the rectification of the order of assessment.5.
When this application was placed for hearing for Rule before the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Tendolkar the Court ordered that Rule confined to the order, dated 12th October, 1955, be issued.
It is evident in view of the order passed by this Court that the petition, in so far as it challenges the validity of the assessment order passed by the Incometax Officer on 26th October, 1951, has been disposed of, and in this petition we are only concerned to decide whether a Writ of Certiorari may be issued quashing the order, dated 12th October, 1955.6.
There is no substance in the contention that because the Phaltan State Incometax Act has been repealed an order under S. 35 of the Incometax Act rectifying a mistake in an assessment order passed by the Incometax Officer cannot be passed.
Even though the Phaltan State Incometax has been repealed by the Taxation Laws (Extension to Merged States and Amendment) Act, 1949, for purposes of levy, assessment and collection of incometax and supertax the Phaltan Incometax Act does survive, and rectification of a mistake in assessment must be regarded as assessment within the meaning of S. 7 of the Taxation Laws (Extension to Merged States and Amendment) Act, 1949.
We are also unable to agree with the contention of Mr. Palkhivala that S. 35 of the Indian Incometax Act contemplates rectification of mistakes which are clerical or arthimetical only.
Section 35 of the Incometax Act enables the Incometax Officer, to rectify any mistake apparent from the record of the assessment.
Jurisdiction under S. 35 of the Act therefore is to rectify mistakes which are apparent from the record and is not restricted to rectification of mistakes which are merely clerical or arithmetical.
We are also unable to agree with the contention raised by Counsel for the assessee that the mistake which is to be rectified must be apparent on the face of the record.
The Legislature has not used in S. 35 the expression mistake apparent on the face of the record and we are unable to equate the expression apparent from the record used in that section with the expression apparent on the face of the record.
It is however true that the mistake to be rectified must be a mistake apparent from the record of the Incometax Officer, i. e., it must be a mistake patent on the record and not a mistake which may be discovered by a process of elucidation, argument or debate See Sidramappa Andannappa v. Commissioner of Incometax, 54
Bom LR 163, at page 167 (AIR 1952 Bom 287 at p. 288) (A).7.
Mr. Palkhivala urged that even if his contention as to the extent of the jurisdiction of the Incometax Officer under S. 35 be not accepted, there was no error apparent from the record which attracted the application of S. 35.
It was contended that if in ascertaining whether there was error apparent from the record the Incometax Officer had not only to look at the record of the assessee but also to look at the record of the Company, i. e., he had to traverse beyond the record of the assessee, it could not be said that the error fell within S. 35 of the Act.
It was also urged that as evidence had to be considered in deciding whether error had been committed, the error was not apparent from the record.
Counsel further contended that assuming that an error was committed, there were several other errors committed by the Incometax Officer in making the assessment, and the Incometax Officer was bound to rectify those errors also.
It was submitted that in making the assessment the Incometax Officer took into consideration the total world income of the assessee as inclusive of the capital gains, which, the assessee being a nonresident, could not be taken into account.
It was also submitted that the British Indian dividend income was grossed up by adding the tax paid by the Companies which paid the dividend and that could not lawfully be done.
It was further submitted that in taking into account the income of the assessee as a partner holding a five annas share in the firm of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons, the Incometax Officer had committed an error.
It was urged that, if at all, the dividend income of the assessee could be regarded as that of a holder of ten shares in the Company and the dividend income could not exceed 1/10th of the net income of the Company which was deemed to have been distributed under S. 23A of the Incometax Act.
Finally it was contended that even assuming that there was an error committed in the assessment order in not grossing up the dividend income by adding thereto the tax paid by the Company, the assessee having been treated merely as a nominee of the real holder of the shares, the error committed by the Incometax Officer in making the order of assessment, was in giving credit for the tax paid by the Company and not in regarding a fraction of the net income of the Company as the income of the assessee, and inasmuch as the notice under S. 35 of the Incometax Act did not relate to this error, the order, dated 12th October, 1955, was without jurisdiction.
An elaborate argument was presented before us by Mr. Palkhivala in support of the various submissions made by him.
It is sufficient to observe that there is no warrant for holding that in ascertaining whether there is an error apparent from the record, the officer can look at the order of assessment alone and nothing else.
All proceedings which constitute evidence on which the assessment order is passed must be regarded as record for the purpose of S. 35.
We are also unable to hold that the Incometax Officer is prohibited from looking at the evidence to ascertain whether an error has been committed.
Again, for several reasons Counsel is not entitled to contend that beside the error referred to in the notice there are other errors in the order of assessment.
It was to be noted that the assesses did not prefer an appeal against the original assessment, even though it was competent to him to do so.
The order has, therefore, become final.
Again, the Rule in this petition is confined to the validity of the order, dated 12th October, 1955, and the petitioners are not entitled to challenge the validity of the assessment, their petition in that behalf having been rejected.
It was open to the assessee to submit an application invoking the jurisdiction of the Incometax Officer under S. 35 to rectify the errors complained of, but no such application has been preferred, and the alleged errors cannot be set up in answer to a rectification already made by the Incometax Officer.8.
But as we have already pointed out, in answer to the notice under S. 23 (2) of the Incometax Act, the assessee contended that he held the shares of the Company as nominee of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons, and that contention was accepted by the Incometax Officer.
It was open to the Incometax Officer to assess the assessee on the dividend income received in respect of the ten shares held by him, but the officer chose to assess the real owner.
Under S. 16 (2) of the Incometax Act in computing the total income to an assessee,any dividend shall be deemed to be income of the previous year in which it is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed to him, and shall be increased to such amount as would, if incometax () at the rate applicable to the total income of a company () for the financial year in which the dividend is paid, credited or distributed or deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed were deducted therefrom, be equal to the amount of the dividend.
Under S. 18, subs.
(5), an assessee is entitled to be given credit for the incometax or supertax on the dividend income paid on his behalf, and that is made further clear by S. 49B which provides that where any dividend has been paid, credited or distributed or is deemed to have been paid, credited or distributed to a shareholder of a company assessed to incometax, the shareholder, if the dividend is included in his total Income, be deemed in respect of such dividend himself to have paid incometaxat the rate applicable to the total income of the Company.
It was, therefore, open to the Incometax Officer to have assessed the dividend on the ten shares held by the assessee after grossing up the tax attributable to the shares, and the assessee would in that event have been entitled to claim credit for the tax paid by the Company on the dividend received by him.
But the Incometax Officer did not assess the assessee as a shareholder he accepted the contention of the assessee that the assessee was a nominee of the firm of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons and on that footing he distributed the dividend income between the partners.
On the distribution of the dividend income so made, the amount deemed to have been received by the assessee in that income as partner of the firm could not be regarded as dividend income in the hands of the assessee.
In the hands of the firm it was evidently dividend income, but in the hands of the assessee it could only be his share of the profits of the firm.
Not being dividend income in the hands of the assessee.
S. 16 (2) of the Incometax Act had no application, and the income which has to be taken into account was 5/16th share in the net income received by the firm of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons.
It may be that even the income was not grossed up by adding thereto the incometax paid thereon by the Company, the assessee could not be given credit for the tax paid by the Company.
But the mistake committed by the Incometax Officer was in giving credit for the tax paid and not in failing to gross up the income under S. 16 (2).9.
In taking this view as to the nature of the 5/6th share deemed to have been received by the assessee from the income of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons, we are supported by a judgment of this Court in Shree Shakti Mills, Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay City, (1948) 16 ITR 187 (AIR 1948 Bom 394 ) (B).
In that case it was held it is only the shareholders of a company to whom dividends are paid who is entitled to the procedure of processing permissible under Ss. 16 (2) and 18 (5).
Consequently, a person who purchased certain shares but did not get himself transferred in the books of the company as the shareholder is not entitled to the procedure laid down in Ss. 16 (2) and 18 (5) in respect of the amount representing dividend received by him from the registered holder who had sold the shares to him.
In Shree Shakti Mills case (B), the assesseecompany had purchased certain shares during the accounting year and had received from the transferor in respect of those shares certain amount representing dividends.
In the return made by the assesseecompany, a claim was made that the amount received from the transferor be processed under Ss. 16 (2) and 18 (5) of the Incometax Act.
The Taxing Authorities refused to grant to the assesseecompany the rights and concessions permissible under Ss. 16 (2) and 18 (5) because the certificates under S. 20 of the Act were not produced.
It appears that even though the shares were purchased by the assesseecompany, the shares were not transferred in the books of the company in the name of the assessee, and they continued to stand in the name of the transferor.
This Court held that the assessee had not received any dividend from the company but had only received an amount representing the dividend from the registered holder of the shares.
It was observed by the learned Chief Justice in delivering the principal judgment that as the assessee had purchased the shares but had not taken steps to get the same transferred in the books of the company,the shareholder from whom the shares were purchased received the dividend from the company and qua the assessee the shareholder became a bare trustee with regard to the dividend received by him and the shareholder would be liable to pay the assessee an amount representing the dividend.
It is clear from this decision that the dividend received by a nominal holder of shares and paid to the real owner cannot be regarded as dividend income of the real owner within the meaning of S. 16 (2) of the Act and such income is not liable to be processed in terms of Ss. 16 (2) and 18 (5) of the Act.10.
In the case before us, the firm of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons being the real owners of the shares and the assessee being merely a nominal holder, the firm could not claim to process the income under Ss. 16 (2) and 18 (5) of the Act.
The assessment of the assessee quae the dividend income received by the firm is as a partner of that firm and not in his capacity as holder of the shares.
The principle of Shree Shakti Mills case (B), must, therefore, apply.11.
It is clear, therefore, that an error was committed in the order of assessment for the year 194748, but the error lay in giving credit for the incometax paid by the Company to the assessee as a partner of the firm of Mafatlal Gagalbhai and Sons, who were held to be the real owners of the shares and not in failing to process the dividend income in the hands of the assessee.12.
The first proviso to S. 35, subs.
(1) of the Incometax Act provides that no rectification shall be made having the effect of enhancing an assessment, unless the Incometax Officer has given notice to the assessee of his intention to do so and has allowed the assessee a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
In the present case, the notice not being in relation to the error committed, but in respect of what was not an error at all, the Incometax Officer had no jurisdiction to rectify the order of assessment.
It may be pointed out that rectification can only be made within four years from the date of the order passed by the Incometax Officer and the jurisdiction to rectify the assessment to the prejudice of the assessee can only be exercised after giving notice of the intention to rectify, and after giving reasonable opportunity to the assessee of being heard against the proposed rectification.13.
Mr. Joshi, who appears on behalf of the Incometax Officer, has contended that the ground which is accepted by us was never set up before the Incometax Officer and it has not been even clearly mentioned in the petition to this Court.
It must be conceded that this ground does not appear to have been urged before the Incometax Officer.
But in the petition, a plea of want of jurisdiction of the Incometax Officer has been raised.
If in fact there was no error committed which the Incometax Officer sought to rectify, we will not be justified in refusing to quash the order merely on the plea that the Incometax Officer was not asked to stay his hands on the ground mentioned before us.
It may also be stated that the application before this Court is somewhat argumentative and even though at more places than one it is urged that the order dated 12th October, 1955, is without jurisdiction, the argument that it is without jurisdiction, in that the error mentioned in the notice under S. 35 is not an error at all, has not been clearly pleaded.
This infirmity in the petition, however, does not affect the jurisdiction of this Court to grant relief, especially when the plea of want of jurisdiction but not the true ground in support thereof has been raised.
We have invited Counsel for the Commissioner to make his submission on this plea, and it has not been submitted before us that he was taken by surprise or that any material, which has a bearing on that contention, has not been placed before us.14.
Mr. Joshi also contended that Shree Shakti Mills case (B) has not been correctly decided.
He urged that the income received as dividend by a trustee or a nominal holder of share does not lose its character in the hands of the beneficial owner of the shares.
We are unable to entertain this argument.
The decision in Shree Shakti Mills case (B) is binding upon this Court.
It may be pointed out that this decision has also been followed by other Courts (see, e. g., Bikaner Trading Co. v. Commissioner of Incometax, (1953) 24 ITR 419 (Cal) (C) and Jaluram Bhikulal v. Commissioner of Incometax, (1952) 22 ITR 490 (AIR 1953 Nag 187) (D).15.
On the view taken by us, the Rule is made absolute and the order passed by the Incometax Officer on 12th October, 1955, modifying the total world income of the assessee, is set aside.
The consequent demand notice and the challans for recovery of excess tax are also quashed.
Having regard to the circumstances of the case, and especially the circumstances that the petitioners are succeeding on a question which was not raised before the Incometax Officer and not clearly set up even in the petition to this Court we make no order as to costs of this application.
Rule made absolute.
