The submission of Shri Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for the petitioners is that petitionerKanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju is the sitting Member of Parliament and an FIR has been filed against the petitionerKanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju because of political rivalry as though he was elected as an M.P. of a particular political party but he criticized the action of said party and hence FIR has been filed because of political vendetta.

At this stage, we are not inclined to go into the merits of the allegations made in the FIR and the submissions in that regard made by learned counsel for the petitioners as at present we are concerned with the medical condition of the petitionerKanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju regarding which there has been remarks by the Magistrate in his order dated 15.05.2021 when he was produced before the Magistrate for remand.
The Magistrate has directed to refer the petitionerKanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju for medical examination to the Superintendent of Government Hospital General Hospital, Guntur and Ramesh Hospital, Guntur to get examine the accused person in the presence of his security of Y category.

Thereafter, Division Bench of the High Court by its order dated 15.05.2021 had directed that the medical examination be conducted by the medical board headed by the Superintendent of Government General Hospital, Guntur with other government doctors as members of the Board.
Today medical report has been placed before us which we have perused.
