 Bilal Nazki, J.Rule.2.
Learned Associate Advocate General appearing for the State waives service.3.
By consent of the parties and looking to the issues involved, Rule made returnable and heard forthwith.4.
This Writ Petition has been filed by the petitioner for quashing of the F.I.R. being F.I.R. No. 151 of 2007 registered with Cuffed Parade Police Station and thereafter numbered as 74/2007 transferred with EOW Wing of crime Branch, Mumbai, under Sections 406, 420, and 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code on a complaint having been made by respondent No.2.
Earlier also this petitioner had filed a writ petition being Writ Petition No. 1796 of 2007, which was withdrawn by him with liberty to approach the Court again in case need arises.5.
The F.I.R. which is sought to be quashed by the Court, makes certain allegations against the petitioner and it was stated in the complaint that the accused persons, in collusion and in connivance with each other, preplanned and established a company known as City Limousines (India) Pvt.
Ltd.
They promoted the scheme of Go Vehicle on rental basis and earning by sitting at home, assuring the people for earning the moneys in easy way.
The company issued public advertisement in a newspaper.
They also issued pamphlets and attracted huge investments.
The accused persons accepted crores of rupees and the amount so realized was misappropriated and thereby the investors were deceived.
Thereafter, it is the case of the prosecution that the statement of the complainant was recorded in which he gave details with regard to the affairs of the company and he stated that he saw an advertisement in the local Marathi newspaper which read as Give the Motor Car on rental basis and earn the moneys sitting at home.
In the said advertisement the name and address of the company was given as M s. Limousine India Limited, 102, Mittal Tower, B Wing,10th Floor, Nariman point, Mumbai 400 021.
In the advertisement, it was also mentioned that the motor car would be purchased in the name of the investors and if the same was given on rental basis, good profit per month shall be given to the investors on their investments.
On reading the said advertisement, he went to make detailed inquiry.
He along with his friend went to the address given in the said advertisement of the company.
There were many persons sitting in the office, who were also making inquiry.
When he made inquiries, he was sent to a cabin where one Smt.
Geeta Razaki was sitting.
The said Geeta Razaki introduced herself as the Administrative Director of the said Company.
The other person sitting there also introduced himself as Sayed Mohamed Masood Jamdar, as the Managing Director of the said Company.
At that time the Complainant asked them about the reference in the newspaper.
The said two persons then told him the details about the Company and also gave information with respect to the scheme.
He was told that the car would be of ownership of the investors and the investors would be entitled to profit per month.
The scheme was that the owner would purchase a car of Maruti Omni and the same would be given to the Company on rental basis.
He was told that he would have to invest an amount of Rs.97,907/in the Company, the company shall purchase a Maruti Omni car in his name and the same shall be allowed to run on rental basis to other companies and the Complainant would get a sum of Rs.4,000/per month for a period of sixty months and after completion of the period of sixty months the said car would remain in the ownership of the Complainant as it would be returned to him.
Then on 26th July, 2007, he prepared a cheque for the amount of Rs.97,907/and handed it over to the Company and thereafter an agreement was signed by the parties.
The Company paid per month Rs.4,000/to the Complainant as agreed upon, but after completion of five years the Maruti Omni car was not handed over to the Complainant.6.
Therefore, the dispute revolves whether the Company had promised to handover the car back to the investors or the company had only promised to pay Rs.4,000/per month for a period of five years.
Since it is not disputed that Rs.4,000/per month were paid by the Company for a period of five years, it would mean that after investing Rs.97,907/the Complainant has already received an amount of Rs.2,40,000/within five years.7.
The F.I.R. has been challenged mainly on the ground that even if there is any dispute with regard to the interpretation of a particular clause in the agreement, it would be a civil dispute and would not be a matter for criminal investigation.
In this connection, the learned Senior Counsel Mr.Tulsi, appearing for the petitioner, has drawn our attention to the various clauses of the agreement and in particular clauses 8 and 15, which read thus8.
Buy Back The Lessee will have the option at the discretion of the Lessor registered owner to purchase the vehicle at a fair market value upon mutual consent after the expiry of the agreement.
However, this buyback clause is not to be construed to be conferring any enforceable right on the Lessee but the first option to buy the car shall be that of the Lessee herein.15.
Issue of Preference Shares The Lessee undertakes to issue redeemable Preference shares to the Lessor towards the margin money paid (excluding Insurance RTO charges) which will be held by the Lessor as security for the entire period of the validity of the agreement being 60 months from the date of issue to ensure smooth installment payments to the bank and the lease hire charges to the Lessor.8.
On the other hand learned Associate Advocate General has submitted that the Petitioner has duped several hundred investors by this scheme by not handing over the vehicle to them after the agreed period was over.
He has also drawn our attention to some clauses of the agreement and in particular clause Nos.4 and 10, which read thus4.
Inspection The Lessor is entitled to inspect the Vehicle given on Lease rent once in 3 months by giving 15 days prior notices to the above stated address and inspect the vehicle at any of the offices of the Lessee in India.10.
Completion of contract Upon successful completion of the terms of this agreement, the Lessor shall receive the leased Vehicle in proper working condition including the tyres and battery in good condition with normal wear and tear acceptable depending on the period of use.
The learned Associate Advocate General submits that as a matter of fact this agreement shows that the car would be purchased in the name of the investor, but the car was not at all purchased in the name of the investor and was purchased in the name of the Company.
Therefore, from the beginning the petitioner had the intention to deceive and, therefore, whether the car had to be returned at the completion of the contract or not would not be material.
But the material question would be whether the petitioner had, from the beginning, intention to deceive, which he had in fact, as the vehicle was not purchased in the name of the investor.
In this connection, the learned Associate Advocate General has drawn our attention to clause VIII of the Lessees Covenants, which reads thusVIII)
Permit the Lessor to terminate the agreement forth with and take possession of the vehicle let out on lease hire from the Lessee in the event of determined failure or default by the Lessee of any of the terms and conditions of this agreement and to successfully settling the outstanding if in favor of the H.P. Owner Finance company, which will be the sole responsibility and liability of the Lessor.9.
Since there is no controversy on facts and no further facts need to be even investigated by the police because it is admitted case of both the parties that the monies were paid for a period of five years at the rate of Rs.4,000/per month but the vehicle was not returned.
Whereas the case of the petitioner is that they could retain the vehicle and in terms of the agreement they could sell the vehicle to anybody and the complainant had the preference.
In any case, Mr. Tulsi, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that the price of the car after being used for a period of five years would be very low.
Learned Senior Counsel further submitted that such controversies have always been held to be, at the best, a subject matter of civil litigation rather than a criminal litigation.
He has drawn our attention to the various judgments of the Supreme Court and has filed a compilation listing 19 cases.
But he has relied on only few of them.
One of them being the case of M s. Indian Oil Corporation v. M s. NEPC India Limited and others, reported in AIR 2006 SC 2780 .
The case of the Complainant in this case was that in case of breach of a contract he was entitled to take possession of certain aircrafts and in this connection the relevant portion of the complaint was, The complainant states that the act of NEPC India Limited in removing the engines and certain other parts from the aircraft stationed at the Coimbatore Airport, Coimbatore, is against the terms of the hypothecation deed dated 1st May, 1997 as well as terms of agreement dated 20th September, 1997 and will amount to theft, criminal breach of trust and cheating which are punishable under Sections 378, 403, 405, 415 and 425 of the Indian Penal Code.
The Supreme Court in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the judgment observed as under10.
While on this issue, it is necessary to take notice of a growing tendency in business circles to convert purely civil disputes into criminal cases.
This is obviously on account of a prevalent impression that civil law remedies are time consuming and do not adequately protect the interests of lenders creditors.
Such a tendency is seen in several family dispute also, leading to irretrievable break down of marriages families.
There is also an impression that if a person could somehow be entangled in a criminal prosecution, there is a likelihood of imminent settlement.
Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which do not involve any criminal offense, by applying pressure through criminal prosecution should be deprecated and discouraged.
In G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P. (2000 (2) SCC 636 ), this Court observedIt is to be seen if a matter, which is essentially of civil nature, has been given a cloak of criminal offense.
Criminal proceedings are not a short cut of other remedies available in law.
Before issuing process a criminal court has to exercise a great deal of caution.
For the accused it is a serious matter.
This Court has laid certain principles on the basis of which High Court is to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code.
Jurisdiction under this Section has to be exercised to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.
While no one with a legitimate cause or grievance should be prevented from seeking remedies available in criminal law, a complainant who initiates or persists with a prosecution, being fully aware that the criminal proceedings are unwarranted and his remedy lies only in civil law, should himself be made accountable, at the ends of such misconceived criminal proceedings, in accordance with law.
One positive step that can be taken by the courts, to curb unnecessary prosecutions and harassment of innocent parties, is to exercise their power under section 250 Cr.
P.C.
More frequently, where they discern malice or frivolousness or ulterior motives on the part of the complainant.
Be that as it may.11.
Coming to the facts of this case, it is no doubt true that IOC has initiated several civil proceedings to safeguard its interest and recover the amounts due.
It has filed C.S. No.425/1997 in the Madras High Court and O.S. No.3327/1998 in the City Civil Court, Chennai seeking injunctive reliefs to restrain the NEPC India from removing its aircrafts so that it can exercise its right to possess the Aircrafts.
It has also filed two more suits for recovery of the amounts due to it for the supplies made, that is CS No.998/1999 against NEPC India (for recovery of Rs.5,28,23,501.90) and CS No.11/2000 against Skyline (for recovery of Rs.13,12,76,421.25), in the Madras High Court.
IOC has also initiated proceedings for winding up NEPC India and filed a petition seeking initiation of proceedings for contempt for alleged disobedience of the orders of temporary injunction.
These acts show that civil remedies were and are available in law and IOC has taken recourse to such remedies.
But it does not follow there from that criminal law remedy is barred or IOC is estopped from seeking such remedy.
Mr. Tulsi, learned Senior Counsel, has also drawn our attention to another judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. and Others v s
Md.
Sharaful Haque and others , reported in (2005) 1 SCC 122 , to submit that if the Court finds that there is no criminal case it is duty bound to quash the proceedings.
In this case the Court held, it would be abuse of the process of the court to allow any action which would result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice.
In exercise of the powers court would be justified to quash any proceeding, if it finds that initiation continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice.
When no offense is disclosed by the complaint, the court may examine the question of fact.
When a complaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the complainant has alleged and whether any offense is made out even if the allegations are accepted in toto.
The Court further held, When exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the High Court would not ordinarily embark upon an inquiry whether the evidence in question is reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation would not be sustained.
That is the function of the trial Judge.
Judicial process should not be an instrument of oppression, or, needless harassment.
Court should be circumspect and judicious in exercising discretion and should take all relevant facts and circumstances into consideration before issuing process, lest it would be an instrument in the hands of a private complainant to unleash vendetta to harass any person needlessly.
Then, there are well known and well recognized facts laid down by the Supreme Court is the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan La l, reported in 1992 Supp (1) 335.
In the said case the Supreme Court observed, A note of caution was, however, added that the power should be exercised sparingly and that too in rarest of rare cases.
The illustrative categories indicated by the Supreme Court are as follows(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirely do not prima facie constitute any offense or make out a case against the accused.(2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offense, justifying an investigation by police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.(3) Where the uncontroversial allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offense and make out a case against the accused.(4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offense but constitute only a no cognizable offense, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the Act concerned (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or Act concerned, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party.(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge.10.
Learned Senior Counsel also submitted that in order to make an offense under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, the accused must have the intention at the inception of the contract.
However, there is nothing in the complaint or in the statement of the complainant to show that the accused had such an intention at the inception of the contract.
In this connection, reliance is placed on the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in Raymond Ltd. (JKFT Division) v s H. V. Doshi and Brothers Pvt. Ltd., reported in 2006(1) CHN 578, wherein the Court held, In order to establish cheating as provided in Section 420 of IPC it must be established that the accused petitioner had the intention to induce, deceive and cheat the complainant right from very beginning.
In the instant case, nothing such happened as it transpired from petition of complaint.
Similarly, the Supreme Court in Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati v s CBI, New Delhi, reported in (2003) 5 SCC 257 , held, It is settled law, by a catena of decisions, that for establishing the offense of cheating, the complainant is required to show that the accused had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation.
From his making failure to keep promise subsequently, such a culpable intention right at the beginning that is at the time when the promise was made cannot be presumed.
In case of Ajay Mitra v s State of M.P. Ors ., reported in 2003(1)
SCALE 487, analyzing Sections 420 and 415 of the Indian Penal Code, the Supreme Court in para 16 of the said judgment held as underA guilty intention is an essential ingredient of the offense of cheating.
In other words means rea on the part of the accused must be established before he can be convicted of an offense of cheating.
(See Jeswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. The State of Bombay AIR 1956 SC 575 ).
In Mahadeo Prasad v. State of West Bengal, AIR 1954 SC 724 , it was held as followsWhere the charge against the accused is under S. 420 in that he induced the complainant to part with his goods, on the understanding that the accused would pay for the same on delivery but did not pay, if the accused had at the time he promised to pay cash against delivery an intention to do so, the fact that he did not pay would not convert the transaction into one of cheating.
But if on the other hand he had no intention whatsoever to pay but merely said that he would do so in order to induce the complainant to part with the goods then a case of cheating would be established.
The Supreme Court in SW Palanitkar Ors.
V s. State of Bihar Anr., reported in 2002 (1) SCC 241 , in paragraph 24 of its judgment held as underMany a times, complaints are filed under Section 200 Cr.
P.C.
By the parties with an oblique motive or for collateral purposes to harass, to wreck vengeance, to pressurize the accused to bring them to their own terms or to enforce the obligations arising out of breach of contract touching commercial transactions instead of approaching civil courts with a view to realize money at the earliest.
It is also to be kept in mind that when parties commit wrongful act constituting a criminal offense satisfying necessary ingredients of an offense, they cannot be allowed to walk away with an impression that no action could be taken against them on the criminal side.
A wrongful or illegal act such as criminal breach of trust, misappropriation, cheating or defamation may give rise to action both on civil as well as on the criminal side when it is clear from the complaint and sworn statements that necessary ingredients of constituting an offense are made out.
May be parties are entitled to proceed on civil side only in a given situation in the absence of an act constituting an offense but not to proceed against the accused in a criminal prosecution.
Hence before issuing a process a Magistrate has to essentially keep in mind the scheme contained in the provisions of Sections 200203 Cr.
P.C. keeping in mind the position of law stated above and pass an order judiciously and not mechanically or in a routine manner.
In Alpic Finance Limited v s P. Sadasivan and Anr., reported in 2001(2)
SCALE 75, the Supreme Court held as underThe facts in the present case have to be appreciated in the light of the various decisions of this Court.
When somebody suffers injury to his person, property or reputation, he may have remedies both under civil and criminal law.
The injury alleged may form basis of civil claim and may also constitute the ingredients of some crime punishable under criminal law.
When there is dispute between the parties arising out of a transaction involving passing of valuable properties between them, the aggrieved person may have right to sue for damages or compensation and at the same time, law permits the victim to proceed against the wrongdoer for having committed an offense of criminal breach of trust or cheating.
Here the main offense alleged by the appellant is that respondents committed the offense under Section 420 I.P.C.
And the case of the appellant is that respondents have cheated him and thereby dishonestly induced him to deliver property.
To deceive is to induce a man to believe that a thing is true which is false and which the person practicing the deceit knows or believes to be false.
It must also be shown that there existed a fraudulent and dishonest intention at the time of commission of the offense.
There is no allegation that the respondents made any willful misrepresentation.
Even according to the appellant, parties entered into a valid lease agreement and the grievance of the appellant is that the respondents failed to discharge their contractual obligations.
In the complaint there is no allegation that there was fraud or dishonest inducement on the part of the respondents and thereby the respondents parted with the property.
It is trite law and common sense that an honest man entering into a contract is deemed to represent that he has the present intention of carrying it out but if, having accepted the pecuniary advantage involved in the transaction, he fails to pay his debt, he does not necessarily evade the debt of deception.11.
Learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that in view of all these judgments and in view of the admitted fact with regard to the case, one thing is clear that there has been no intention to deceive at the inception of the contract and there can be genuine disputes between the parties with regard to the interpretation of various clauses of the agreement.
He submits that paragraphs 8 and 15 of the agreement would need a construction so as not to render any of the clauses of the agreement redundant and that can be done by the civil court.
He submits that in any case there is no cheating or fraud manifested by the conduct of the accused persons and as such the F.I.R. needs to be quashed.12.
On the other hand the learned Associate Advocate General submits that the fact that since no vehicle was purchased in the name of the investors, it should be presumed that there was intention of cheating at inception and certain clauses of the agreement were clear that vehicle had to be returned to the investors.
He has also drawn our attention to the statement made by some of the complainants and has drawn our attention to various judgments.
He referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in State of West Bengal and Others v s Swapan Kumar Guha and Other s, reported in (1982) 1 SCC 561.
He also referred to the much referred Privi Council case of King Emperor v s Khwaja Nazir Ahmad, reported in AIR 1945 PC 18 .
The learned Associate Advocate General submitted that once a cognizable offense is made out in the F.I.R. the investigation must go on and should not be stopped.
The learned Associate Advocate General dealt on the same aspect of the matter by relying on the judgment in the case of Superintendent of Police, CBI and Others v s Tapan Kumar Singh, reported in (2003) 6 SCC 175.
In paragraph 20 of the said judgment, the Supreme Court observed, What is of significance is that the information given must disclose the commission of a cognizable offense and the information so lodged must provide a basis for the police officer to suspect the 18 commission of a cognizable offense.
He has also referred to the case of T. T. Antony v s State of Kerala, reported in (2001) 6 SCC 181.
In paragraph 18 of the said judgment the Supreme Court held as underAn information given under subsection (1) of Section 154 Cr.
P.C. Is commonly known as first information report (FIR) though this term is not used in the Code.
It is a very important document.
And as its nickname suggests it is the earliest and the first information of a cognizable offense recorded by an officer in charge of a police station.
It sets the criminal law in motion and marks the commencement of the investigation which ends of with the formation of opinion under Section 169 of 170 Cr.P.C., as the case may be, and forwarding of a police report under Section 173 Cr.
P.C.
It is quite possible and it happens not infrequently that more informations than one are given to a police officer in charge of a police station in respect of the same incident involving one or more than one cognizable offenses.
In such a case he need not enter every one of them in the station house diary and this is implied in Section 154 Cr.P.C.
Apart from a vague information by a phone call or a cryptic telegram, the information first entered in the station house diary, kept for this purpose, by a police officer in charge of a police station is the first information report FIR postulated by Section 154 Cr.
P.C.
All other informations made orally or in writing after the commencement of the investigation into the cognizable offense disclosed from the facts mentioned in the first information report and entered in the station house diary by the police officer or such other cognizable offenses as may come to his notice during the investigation, will be statements falling under Section 162 Cr.P.C.
No such information statement can properly be treated as an FIR and entered in the station house diary again, as it would in effect be a second FIR and the same cannot be in conformity with the scheme of Cr.
P.C. Take a case where an FIR mentions cognizable offense under Section 307 or 326 IPC and the investigating agency learns during the investigation or receives fresh information that the victim died, no fresh FIR under Section 302
IPC need be registered which will be irregular in such a case alteration of the provision of law in the first FIR is the proper course to adopt.
Let us consider a different situation in which H having killed W, his wife, informs the police that she is killed by an unknown person or knowing that W is killed by his mother or sister, H owns up the responsibility and during investigation the truth is detected it does not require filing of fresh FIR against H the real offender who can be arraigned in the report under Section 173(2) or 173(8) Cr.
P.C.
As the case may be.
It is of course permissible for the investigating officer to send up a report to the Magistrate concerned even earlier that investigation is being directed against the person suspected to be the accused.
Another judgment referred by him is the case of Ramesh Bajaj v s State NCT of Delhi and others, reported in (1999) 3 SCC 259.
In this case the Supreme Court took cognizance of the material that had become available to the investigating agency after the investigation had been started and it also quoted extensively from the Bhajan Lals case (supra) and in paragraph 9 it stated, If factual foundation for the offense has been laid in the complaint the court should not hasten to quash criminal proceedings during investigation stage merely on the premise that one or two ingredients have not been stated with details.
In paragraph 10 the Supreme Court held that the facts narrated in the complaint disclose commercial transaction or money transaction, but that was hardly a reason for holding that the offense of cheating could elude from such a transaction and noted that many a cheatings were committed in the course of commercial and money transactions.
Then in paragraph 11 it gave the conclusion, which reads thusThe crux of the postulate is the intention of the person who induces the victim of his representation and not the nature of the transaction which would become decisive in discerning whether there was commission of offense or not.
The complainant has stated in the body of the complaint that he was induced to believe that the respondent would honor payment on receipt of invoices, and that the complainant realized later that the intentions of the respondent were not clear.
He also mentioned that the respondent after receiving the goods had sold them to others and still he did not pay the money.
Such averments would prima facie make out a case for investigation by the authorities.13.
At the cost of repetition we may mention that the facts in the present case are not at dispute at all that the investment made by each of the consumers to the tune of Rs.97,907/and in return they received Rs.2,40,000/.The only question which remained was whether the investors were entitled to the car at the end of the period of five years or not.
There has been no intention to defraud at the time of inception of execution of the agreement.
There can be made several interpretations of the clauses in the agreement if the agreement is taken as a whole.
It is a well accepted principle of interpretation that while interpreting clause of agreement, whole of the agreement has to be taken into consideration.
Applying the principles laid down by the various judgments of the Supreme Court hereinabove referred, we do not think that in the facts and circumstances of the case an offense of cheating is made out.14.
In the circumstances, we allow this petition and quash the FIR No. 151/2007 originally registered against the petitioner by the Cuffed Parade Police Station and thereafter numbered as 74/2007 transferred with EOW Wing of Crime Branch, Mumbai under the provisions of Sections 406, 420, 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code.15.
Rule made absolute in terms aforesaid.16.
No order as to costs.
