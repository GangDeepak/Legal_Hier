The Petitioner has filed the above SLP assailing the judgment of the High Court by which his conviction and sentence under Section 302 IPC was upheld.

On 24.08.2018, notice was issued by this Court on the question of propriety of specifying rigorous imprisonment while imposing life sentence.
6.
As limited notice was issued in both the SLPs, we heard arguments on the point of rigorous imprisonment while convicting a person under Section 302 IPC.
Mr. A. Sirajudeen, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioner in SLP (Crl.)
No.6220 of 2018, submitted that the issue is no more res integra as it is covered by a judgment of this Court in Naib Singh v. State of Punjab Ors.(1983) 2 SCC 454 .
7.
Mr. Ajay Marwah, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner in SLP Crl.
No.7110 of 2018, made an attempt to distinguish the judgment in Naib Singh (supra).
Mr. Debojit Borkakati, learned counsel appearing for the State of Assam, relied upon the judgment of this Court in Dilpesh Balchandra Panchal v. State of Gujarat (1992) 4 SCC 172 to submit that the arguments that are advanced in these cases have been considered by this Court earlier and were rejected.
8.
In Naib Singh (supra) the Petitioner was originally sentenced to death for committing an offence of murder under Section 302 IPC.
Later, the death sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life by the Government of Punjab.
After having undergone sentence of 22 years, Naib Singh filed a Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India challenging his continued detention.
One of the points argued by the Petitioner relates to sentence of imprisonment for life not to be equated to rigorous imprisonment for life.
By taking into account the earlier judgments of this Court in Pandit Kishori Lal v. King Emperor AIR 1945 PC 64 and Gopal Vinayak Godse v. State of Maharashtra 1961 3 SCR 440 , this Court in Naib Singhs case held that the sentence of imprisonment for life has to be equated to rigorous imprisonment for life.
The law laid down by this Court in Naib Singhs was followed by this Court in three judgments Dilpesh Balchandra Panchal v. State of Gujarat, Sat Pal alias Sadhu v. State of Haryana (1992) 4 SCC 172 and Mohd.
Munna v. Union of India (2005) 7 SCC 417 .
9.
In view of the authoritative pronouncements of this Court on the issues that arise for consideration in these SLPs, there is no need to reexamine the limited point for which notice was issued.
10.
Therefore, the Special Leave Petitions are dismissed.
