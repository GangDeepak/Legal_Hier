PW1 was the panch for seizure panchnama of camera.
He has stated in his crossexamination that his signature was obtained on blank paper.

Moreover, PW7 Ujwal Nikose has stated in his crossexamination that he has stated before police that the vehicle found with accused No.2 Anil was given by accused No.1 Shekhar and this fact was disclosed by accused No.1 himself.
Therefore, it is clear that discovery of moped at the instance of accused is not reliable.11.

Spot Panchnama (Exh.28) and Discovery Panchnama (Exh.29) were prepared in his presence.12.
Evidence of PW3 in respect of discovery of moped and dead body is not reliable because he has not identified accused Anil in the Court.
On the other hand, he has specifically stated in his evidence that, I cannot say whether accused No.2 Anil was the same person who made statement voluntarily.
In the crossexamination, he has stated that, he had been to the spot in the night at about 0130 a.m.
They were on the spot for about 34 hours.
The spot was at hilly region in the forest land.
He had not seen deceased Bapurao Ghate.

His evidence is not reliable because as per the panchnama, it was prepared at about 0730 p.m.
This witness not identified the deceased.
Moreover, the dead body was in the form of skeleton.

Accused and said old person were on red motor cycle.
He had talked with accused Anil and he told him that he was going to Nagpur.
In the crossexamination, he has stated in his evidence that old person was not known to him who was along with accused.
