On 21st March, 2006, the Meditab Specialities Private Limited wrote a letter to the Minister for Industries requesting the GIDC to issue a letter of intent for allotment of 250 acres of land.
The said letter was endorsed by the Secretary of Industries by noting that there was no proposal in Form A under Rule 3A of the SEZ Rules.

The material Sections are the Sections 3 and 4 which read thus3.
Procedure for making proposal to establish Special Economic Zone.(1)
A Special Economic Zone may be established under this Act, either jointly or severally by the Central Government, State Government, or any person for manufacture of goods or rendering services or for both or as a Free Trade and Warehousing Zone.(2)
Any person, who intends to set up a Special Economic Zone, may, after identifying the area, make a proposal to the State Government concerned for the purpose of setting up the Special Economic Zone.(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (2), any person, who intends to set up a Special Economic Zone, may, after identifying the area, at his option, make a proposal directly to the Board for the purpose of setting up the Special Economic Zone Provided that where such a proposal has been received directly from a person under this subsection, the Board may grant approval and after receipt of such approval, the person concerned shall obtain the concurrence of the State Government within the period, as may be prescribed.(4)

Every proposal under subsections (2) to (4) shall be made in such form, and, manner, containing such particulars as may be prescribed.(6)
The State Government may, on receipt of the proposal made under subsection (2), forward the same together with its recommendations to the Board within such period as may be prescribed.(7)
Without prejudice to the provisions contained in subsection (8), the Board may, after receipt of the proposal under subsections (2) to (4), approve the proposal subject to such terms and conditions as it may deem fit to impose, or modify or reject the proposal.(8)
The Central Government may prescribed the following requirements for establishment of a Special Economic Zone, namely(a) the minimum area of land and other terms and conditions subject to which the Board shall approve, modify or reject any proposal received by it under subsections (2) to (4) and(b) the terms and conditions, subject to which the Developer shall undertake the authorised operations and his obligations and entitlementsProvided that different minimum area of land and other terms and conditions referred to in clause (a) may be prescribed by the Central Government for a class or classes of Special Economic Zones.(9)

The Central Government shall, on receipt of communication under clause (a) or clause (b) of subsection (9), grant, within such time as may be prescribed, a letter of approval on such terms and conditions and obligations and entitlements as may be approved by the Board, to the Developer, being the person or the State Government concerned Provided that the Central Government may, on the basis of approval of the Board, approve more than one Developer in a Special Economic Zone is cases where one Developer does not have in his possession the minimum area of contiguous land, as may be prescribed, for setting up a Special Economic Zone and in such cases, each Developer shall be considered as a Developer in respect of the land in his possession.(11) Any person who, or a State Government which, intends to provide any infrastructure facilities in the identified area referred to in subsections (2) to (4), or undertake any authorised operation may, after entering into an agreement with the Developer referred to in subsection (10), make a proposal for the same to the Board for its approval and the provisions of subsection (5) and subsections (7) to (10) shall, as far as may be, apply to the said proposal made by such person or the State Government.(12)
Every person or the State Government referred to in subsection (11), whose proposal has been approved by the Board and who, or which, has been granted letter of approval by the Central Government, shall be considered as a CoDeveloper of the Special Economic Zone.(13) Subject to the provisions of this section and the letter of approval granted to a Developer, the Developer may allocate space or built up area or provide infrastructure services to the approved Units in accordance with the agreement entered into by him with the entrepreneurs of such Units.4.
Establishment of Special Economic Zone and approval and authorisation to operate it to, Developer.(1)
The Developer shall, after the grant of letter of approval under subsection (10) of Section 3, submit the exact particulars of the identified area referred to in subsections (2) to (4) of that section, to the Central Government and thereupon that Government may, after satisfying that the requirements, under subsection (8) of Section 3 and other requirements, as may be prescribed, are fulfilled, notify the specifically identified area in the State as a Special Economic Zone Provided that an existing Special Economic Zone shall be deemed to have been notified and established in accordance with the provisions of this Act and the provisions of this Act shall, as far as may be, apply to such Zone accordingly Provided further that the Central Government may, after notifying the Special Economic Zone, if it considers appropriate, notify subsequently any additional area to be included as a part of that Special Economic Zone.(2)
After the appointed day, the Board may, authorise the Developer to undertake in a Special Economic Zone, such operations which the Central Government may authorise.53.
From Section 3, it appears that the proposal for setting up of a SEZ can be initiated by three modes.
The first mode is under Subsection (2) of Section 3 which empowers any person intending to set up a SEZ to make a proposal to the State Government concerned for the purposes of setting up the SEZ.
The said proposal is to be made after identifying the area.
The second mode is under Subsection (3) of Section 3.
Any person who intends to set up a SEZ may after identifying the area has an option to make a proposal directly to the Board of Approval constituted under Section 8(1) of the SEZ Act.
The third mode is where a State government intends to set up a Special Economic Zone.
Under Subsection (4) of Section 3, after identifying the area, the State Government can forward the proposal directly to the Board for the purposes of setting up of a SEZ.
Apart from these three modes by which a proposal can be initiated, under the proviso to Subsection (4) of Section 3, a power has been conferred on the Central Government to suo moto set up and notify SEZ after consulting the State Government concerned but without referring to the proposal to the Board.
However, before notifying the SEZ, the area has to be identified by the Central Government.
Proviso to Subsection (3) of Section 3 lays down that where a person intending to set up a SEZ directly submits a proposal to the Board, the Board may grant approval under Subsection (9) of Section 3 but after receipt of such approval, it is mandatory for the person to obtain concurrence of the State Government within the period as may be prescribed.
The Rule 4 of the SEZ Rules prescribes a period of six months from the date of approval for obtaining concurrence of the State Government.
Thus, when a person adopts first mode contemplated under Subsection (2) of Section 3, the State Government has to be recommend the proposal to the Board.
In case of second mode, after approval is granted by the Board, it is mandatory for the person to obtain concurrence of the State government.
Without such concurrence, no further steps can be taken on the proposal.
In case of third mode, it is the State Government which applies to the Board for approval.
Even if the Central Government exercises its of suo moto power of setting up SEZ, prior consultation with the State Government is required.
Thus, in case of first mode, recommendation of the State Government is mandatory, in case of second mode, the concurrence of the State Government is required and in case of third mode, only the State Government can apply for grant of approval.
Thus, broadly stated, in case of all the three modes, consent or concurrence, as the case may be, of the State Government concerned for setting up of a SEZ is mandatory.
In case of the first and the third modes even approval cannot be granted by the Board of Approval unless there is either a recommendation or proposal of the state government.
In case of second mode, no further steps can be taken after grant of approval by the Board of Approval unless concurrence of the State Government is obtained by the person concerned within a period of six months from the date of approval.
Thus in case of first three modes, the State Government has a major role to play.54.
Under Subsection 9 of Section 3 of SEZ Act, if a proposal received under subsections (2) to (4) is approved by the Board without any modification, the same is required to be communicated to the Central Government.
In case a proposal received under Subsections (2) to (4) of Section 3 is approved with modification, the same is required to be communicated to the person or to the State Government, as the case may be, and only after the said modifications are approved by such person or the State Government, the Board can communicate an approval to the Central Government.
On receiving communication of approval from the Board, under Subsection 10 of Section 3, the Central Government is required to issue a letter of approval on such terms and conditions and obligations, as may be approved by the Board to the developer being the person who intends to set up a SEZ or to the State Government, as the case may be.
Rule 6 of the SEZ Rules provides that the letter of approval has to be issued under Subsection (10) of Section 3 by the Central Government within a period of 30 days of the communication received from the Board of granting approval.
Subsection (13) of Section 3 provides that subject to provisions of Section 3 and Letter of Approval, the developer may allocate space or built up area or provide infrastructure services to the approved units in accordance with the agreement entered into by the developer with the entrepreneur of such units.55.
Under Subsection (1) of Section 4, after grant of Letter of Approval under Subsection (10) of Section 3, the developer is required to submit the exact particulars of the identified area referred to in the proposals under Subsections (2), (3) or (4) of Section 3, as the case may be.
The particulars are required to be submitted to the Central Government.
After the Central Government is satisfied that the requirements regarding minimum area and other terms and conditions are fulfilled, the Central Government may notify the specifically identified area in the State as a SEZ.
Under Clause (a) of Section 2 of the SEZ Act, the appointed day with reference to a SEZ means the date on which SEZ is notified by the Central Government under Subsection (1) of Section 4.
Under Subsection (2) of Section 4, after the appointed day, the Board may authorize the developer to undertake in a notified SEZ such operations which the Central Government may authorize.56.
As pointed out earlier, under Subsection (8) of Section 3, the Central Government is empowered to prescribe requirements of minimum area of the land and other terms and conditions subject to which the Board shall approve the proposal.
Under Subsection (8) of Section 3, the Central Government is also entitled to prescribe the terms and conditions subject to which the developer shall undertake authorized operations.
Accordingly, in Rule 5 of the SEZ Rules, the requirements for establishments of a SEZ including the requirement of minimum area for various categories of SEZs have been prescribed.57.
As far as letter of approval under Subsection (10) of Section 3 is concerned, the Rule 6 of the said SEZ Rules is relevant, which reads thus6.
Letter of Approval to the Developer.
(1) The Central Government shall, within a period of thirty days of the communication received by it under clause (a) or clause (b) of subsection (9) of section 3 of the Act grant following approvals(a) formal approval in the cases where land is in possession of the developer in Form B to the person or the State Government concerned or in Form C, if the approval is for providing infrastructural facilities in the Special Economic Zone, incorporating additional conditions, if any, specified by the Board while approving the proposal(b) in principle approval in other cases in Form B1 to the person or the State Government concerned, incorporating additional conditions, if any specified by the Board while approving the proposal.(2)(a)The letter of approval of a Developer granted under clause (a) of subrule (1) shall be valid for a period of three years within which time, effective steps shall be taken by the Developer to implement the approved proposal Provided that the Board may, on an application by the Developer or codeveloper, for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the validity period for a further period not exceeding two years.(b)
The letter of approval of a Developer granted under clause (b) of subrule (1) shall be valid for a period of one year within which time, the Developer shall submit suitable proposal for formal approval in Form A as prescribed under the provisions of rule 3Provided that the Board may, on an application by the Developer or Codeveloper for reasons to be recorded in writing, extend the validity period for a further period, not exceeding two years, upon a request made in writing by the Developer or Codeveloper.58.
In case of proposals under Subsection (2) or Subsection (4) of Section 3 of the SEZ Act, where the land is in possession of the developer or the State Government concerned, the Central Government is required to issue approval in Form B.
In other cases, where the land is not in possession of the developer or the State Government, the Central Government is required to issue in principle approval and within one year thereof, the Developer is required to submit a suitable proposal for formal approval in Form A.59.
As provided in Subsection (1) of Section 4, after receiving a Letter of Approval, the developer is required to furnish to the Central Government the exact particulars of the identified area referred to in Subsection (2) of Section 3.
Rule 7 of the said SEZ Rules provides for details to be furnished by the developer in accordance with Subsection (1) of Section 4 of the SEZ Act.
One of the requirements prescribed by Subrule (1) of Rule 7 is that a certificate from the concerned State government or its authorized agency is required to be produced stating that the developers have legal possession and irrevocable rights to develop the said area as SEZ and that the said area is free from all encumbrances.
Only after the submission of details as required by Subsection (1) of Section 4 read with Rule 7 and on acceptance of the conditions specified in the Letter of Approval, the Central Government can notify the identified area as a SEZ under Subsection (1) of Section 4 of the SEZ Act.60.
Therefore, in case of a person other than the State Government intending to set up a SEZ, two modes are available for moving the proposal.
One is by making an application to the State Government after identifying the area and second is making an application directly to the Board.
In case of the first mode, it is obvious that the Board cannot process the application and grant approval unless the State government makes recommendation in accordance with Subsection (6) of Section 3 read with Rule 4.
Under Subrule (1) of Rule 4, time of 45 days is granted to the State Government to submit recommendation.
Subrule (2) of Rule 4 requires that while forwarding the proposals, the State Government shall ensure that the requirements under Rule 5 have been complied with.
While forwarding the proposal, the State government is required to attach the copies of the relevant notifications issued by it in this regard.
Thus, unless recommendation of the State Government in accordance with Subsection (6) of Section 3 read with Rule 4 is received by the Board, an approval cannot be granted by the Board.
In case of the second mode, where an application is directly made by the person to the Board, though the board can grant approval, without the concurrence of the State Government, the SEZ cannot be notified under Subsection (1) of Section 4.
The power to grant recommendation will include power to withdraw the Recommendation.
Thus, after recommending a proposal of a person, for the reasons recorded, the State Government can always withdraw its recommendation before the Board grants approval under Subsection (9) of Section 3.
After recommendation is withdrawn, approval under subsection 9 of section 3 cannot be granted by the Board on the basis of the proposal under subsection 2 of section 3.
Even if the recommendation is withdrawn, the person may make an application in accordance with Subsection (3) of Section 2 or even the Central Government can exercise power under the proviso to Subsection (4) of Section 3 of the SEZ Act.61.
Even after the approval is granted under Subsection (9) of Section 3, under Subsection (1) of Section 4 the developer after receiving the Letter of Approval has to submit exact particulars of the identified area to the Central Government.
Rule 7(1) of the SEZ Rules requires not only the particulars but a certificate from the State Government or its authorized agency that the developers have legal possession and irrevocable rights to develop the said area as SEZ and that the said area is free from all encumbrances.
Thus, without such certificate from the State Government or its authorized agency, a notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4 cannot be issued even in case where the second mode has been adopted by the persons concerned.
Thus, even after approval is granted, without certification by the State Government or its authorized agency, the Notification under Section 4(1) cannot be issued.62.
Even after grant of approval by the Board, if the State Government or its authorized agency does not issue a certificate as contemplated by Subrule (1) of Rule 7, the Notification issued under Subsection (1) of Section 4 cannot be issued.
The power to withdraw the approval is implicit in the power conferred to grant approval.
However, it is obvious that the approval can be withdrawn provided the same is not acted upon by issuing the notification under section 4(1).
In a given case, on the basis of the withdrawal of the recommendation by the concerned State Government after the grant of approval, the Board or the Central Government has a power withdraw the approval.
However, after approval is granted, a right is accrued to the applicant to apply for a notification under subsection 1 of section 4.
As the rights of the person concerned may be affected, the Board will have to comply with the principles of natural justice before withdrawing the approval.
In the present case, the decision of the Central Government is that in case of 8 Special Economic Zones for which the approval is granted but no Notification has been issued, the persons concerned will be heard.
In fact show cause notices have been issued to such 8 companies, but in view of pendency of the petitions, no decision has been taken on the show cause notices.
In fact, the Board of Approval had fixed the date of hearing.
The hearing could not proceed in view of filing of the petitions.
The question whether in the facts of the case, the approval should be withdrawn or not will have to be decided by the Board after hearing the concerned parties.
The steps taken by the companies on the basis of the approval will be certainly a relevant consideration when the Board considers the question of withdrawing approval.63.
Based on Subsection (13) of Section 3 of the SEZ Act, a submission was sought to be canvassed by the petitioners in Writ Petition No.349 of 2008 that after receiving the Letter of Approval from the Central Government, without waiting for the Notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4, the developer may allocate spaces or built up areas or provide infrastructure services to the approved units.
Clause z(c) of Section 2 defines unit .The unit means a unit set up by an entrepreneur in a SEZ.
It must be noted here that under Subsection (1) of Section 15, any person who intends to set up a unit for carrying on the authorized operations in a SEZ is required to be submit a proposal to the Development Commissioner concerned in a prescribed form.
After receiving the proposal, the Development Commissioner has to submit the proposal to the Approval Committee constituted under Subsection (1) of Section 13 and the Approval Committee is empowered to approve the proposal submitted by a person who intends to set up a unit.
Section 15 of the SEZ Act reads thus15.
Setting up of Unit.
(1) Any person, who intends to set up a Unit for carrying on the authorised operations in a Special Economic Zone, may submit a proposal to the Development Commissioner concerned in such form and manner containing such particulars as may be prescribed Provided that an existing Unit shall be deemed to have been set up in accordance with the provisions of this Act and such Units shall not require approval under this Act.(2)
On receipt of the proposal under subsection (1), the Development Commissioner shall submit the same to the Approval Committee for its approval.(3)
The Approval Committee may, either approve the proposal without modification, or approve the proposal with modifications subject to such terms and conditions as it may deem fit to impose, or reject the proposal in accordance with the provisions of subsection (8) Provided that in case of modification or rejection of a proposal, the Approval Committee shall afford a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the person concerned and after recording the reasons, either modify for reject the proposal.(4)
Any person aggrieved by an order of the Approval Committee, made under subsection (3), may prefer an appeal to the Board within such time as may be prescribed.64.
The section 13 of the SEZ Act reads thus13.

No act of the Approval Committee shall be called in question on the ground merely of existence of any vacancy in, or any defect in the constitution of, the Approval Committee.(7)
All orders and decisions of the Approval Committee and all other communications issued by it shall be authenticated by the signature of the Chairperson or any other member as may be authorised by the Approval Committee in this behalf.(8)
The term of office of an ex officio Member shall come to an end as soon as he ceases to hold office by virtue of which he was so nominated.
Therefore, in case of a SEZ established after commencement of the Act, the Approval Committee has to be constituted for such SEZ within a period of six months from the date of establishment.
The SEZ is established only after notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4 is issued.
Thus, unless the notification under Section 4(1) is issued, the Approval Committee cannot be constituted.
The approval for setting up of a unit for carrying on the authorized operations in SEZ can be granted only by the Approval Committee in accordance with Section 15.
Thus, the question of granting approval for setting up units for carrying on the authorized operations in the SEZ does not arise unless the notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4 is issued.
The Approval Committee can be set up only after such notification is issued.
Subsection (13) of Section 3 refers to the allocation of space or built up area or providing infrastructure services to the approved units.
The approved units come into existence only after the approval is granted in accordance with Section 15 and, therefore, before publication of the notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4, no approved unit in the SEZ can be in existence.
Therefore, the submission made that under Subsection (13) of Section 3, a developer can allocate space or built up area to the entrepreneur even before the Notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4 is issued cannot be accepted.
It must be also stated that a developer cannot undertake authorized operations only on the basis of the Letter of Approval inasmuch as Subsection (2) of Section 4 provides that only after the appointed day (i.e. the date of notification under Section 4(1)), the Board can authorize a developer to undertake authorized operations.
In Writ Petition no.349 of 2008, the petitioners have claimed that they have entered into commitments the 3rd parties.
In the written submissions, the said petitioners had relied upon only the letters of interest.
No specific agreements executed in favour of any third parties have been relied upon.
Moreover, it is not the case of the petitioners that the said third parties are the approved units in accordance with section 15.
Therefore, the alleged commitments cannot be pressed into service by the petitioners.
Subsection 13 of section 3 permits a developer to allocate or built up area or provide infrastructure services to the approved units in accordance with the agreement entered into by him with the entrepreneurs of such approved units.
As stated earlier, there are no approved units.
In Writ Petition No.380 of 2008, the petitioners have claimed that they have entered into agreements with Cipla Limited for setting up their manufacturing units in the area of the notified SEZ.
However, copies of the agreements are not placed on record.
Even in this petition, there is no pleading that approval has been granted under section 15 to the units proposed to be set up by the Cipla limited.65.
Subsection (13) of Section 3 refers to the agreement entered into by the developer with the entrepreneur of such units.
Reference to such units is to the approved units in accordance with Section 15.
The units can be approved only by the Approval Committee which can be set up only after a Notification under Subsection (1) of Section 4 is issued.
This legal aspect is material for considering the question whether the Board or the Central Government, as the case may be can cancel the approval under subsection 9 and 10 of section 3 or a Notification issued under Subsection (1) of Section 4 for establishing a SEZ.66.
The stand taken by the Assistant Solicitor General of India is that the Central Government has power to effect cancellation of the notification under section 4(1), but in the present case, in respect of three notified SEZs, it has been decided not to exercise the said powers.
In fact, he has placed on record extracts of minutes of 41st meeting of the Board of Approval resolving to denotify a particular SEZ at a particular place.
Whether the Central Government can denotify a notified SEZ without the consent of the developer is a question which need not be decided in the present Petitions inasmuch as the action of the Central Government of declining to denotify the SEZ in three cases has not been specifically challenged before us in any of the Petitions.
Thus, on the basis of the consideration of the provisions of SEZ Act and the SEZ Rules, we hold that before the Board of Approval approves the proposal and before the Letter of Approval is issued by the Central Government, the State Government can always withdraw its recommendation in case the proposal is initiated under Subsection (2) of Section 3 of the SEZ Act.
In such a case, Approval cannot be granted on the basis of the recommendation which is withdrawn.
Even after a Letter of Approval is issued, but before the notification under section 4(1) is issued, the board and or the Central Government has a power to withdraw the approval on the basis of withdrawal of the recommendations by the State Government.
However, the approval can be cancelled or withdrawn in such a case only after following the principles of natural justice.
The fact that several steps have been taken by the developer on the basis of approval will certainly be a relevant consideration which will have to be taken into account by the board.
CONSIDERATION OF QUESTION (d)67.
That takes us for consideration of the next question (d) regarding the legality of the decision of the State Government of withdrawing the SEZ Policy.
The Goa Industrial Policy published in the year 2003 envisages providing of Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services for promotion of industries and development of Goa as an Export and Import Hub.
It also provides for establishing Software Technology Parks SEZ.
In the year 2005, the Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services Policy of Goa was notified by the Government of Goa which envisages setting up of SEZs with special emphasis on Information Technology Sector.
The third policy document is special economic zone policy notified by the Government of Goa on 13th July, 2006.
The said Policy was notified after the SEZ Act came into force with effect from 10th February, 2006.
The policy in short provides for setting up of SEZs in the State of Goa subject to framework determined by the Government of India in accordance with SEZ Act.68.
Admittedly, there was some sort of a public outcry against the establishments of SEZs in the State of Goa.
On 20th December, 2007, the Chief Secretary of Government of Goa issued a White Paper on Special Economic Zone.
According to the Companies, the said White Paper itself sets out several benefits of SEZ which will benefit of the State of Goa The second document relating to withdrawal of the policy is the resolution passed by the Task Force appointed by the State Government under the Regional Plan 2021.
The third document in this behalf is the decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on infrastructure to do away with the SEZ in the present form.69.
There is some controversy as to whether the proposal of the Cabinet Committee was approved by the Cabinet.
In fact, the learned counsel appearing for the Companies made extensive submissions on the basis of the provisions of the Rules of Business of Government of Goa contending that the decision of the Cabinet of SubCommittee can become the decision of the Government provided there is a cabinet approval.
The learned Advocate General of Goa produced a file containing decisions of the cabinet.
In the file, there is a detailed note dated 3rd June 2008 prepared by the Honourable Chief Minister reiterating that the State Government was firm on its decision to do away with the SEZs in the State as pointed out in its letter dated 7th January 2008 addressed to the Central Government.
The Note reiterates the decision of the State Government of withdrawal of SEZ policy which is communicated by the said letter.
The said note makes reference to several decisions taken thereafter including a decision that the matter should be placed before the Cabinet on priority.
The file contains a detailed note prepared by the Secretary (Industries) dated 10th June, 2009 for the purposes of placing before the Cabinet a resolution proposing that the Cabinet may approve the proposal of withdrawal of Goa SEZ Policy of 2006 with immediate effect.
The said note also records that the proposal has been approved by the Honble Chief Minister and the Minister for Industries.
It appears that item No.2 in the meeting of the Cabinet held on 15th June, 2009 was of withdrawal of Goa SEZ Policy of 2006.
The proposal for withdrawal of the policy was formally approved by the Cabinet on the said date.
Thus, the Cabinet of the State Government has formally approved and ratified the earlier decision taken to withdraw the policy.
Order of this Court passed on 16th June 2009 in these petitions takes a note of the said decision.70.
The Council of Ministers passed a Resolution on 5th June, 2006 formulating SEZ policy.
The decision of the Cabinet was published in the Government Gazette dated 13th July, 2006.
In the Government Resolution, it is stated that the SEZ Authority shall ensure the provisions of adequate water supply within the SEZs for SEZ units.
There is a similar provision as regards the power supply.
The Policy also resolves that the exemption shall be granted to the developers of SEZ and industrial units and other establishments from all states and local taxes as well as the exemption from payment of stamp duty and registration fees for a period of five years.71.
The white paper on SEZ in the State of Goa was published on 20th December, 2007.
All details such as applications received for grant of recommendation and steps taken by the Government of Goa for operation of SEZ policy have been set out.
It also deals with the implications of the approvals already given.
He has recorded that SEZs of 7 approved applicants will require 250 MW of electricity which cannot be provided by the State Government.
He recorded that total requirement of water of only 7 applicants will be 16 MLD out of which requirement of 10 MLD is of Pharma SEZ at Keri.
He is noted that in fact said pharma unit was proposing to take raw water from the downstream of a river.
It also notes the decisions taken by the empowered group of Ministers in the Government of India as a result of public outcry against SEZs in the entire country and especially in West Bengal.
Thereafter, in Paragraph 24, the white paper deals with the issues raised against the promotion of SEZ by various organizations.
The comments of the Chief Secretary on every issue have been recorded.72.
The Task Force appointed by the State Government for Regional Plan of 2021 held a special meeting on 23rd December, 2007 in which the representatives of SEZs in Goa including some of the Companies which are parties to the present Petitions were heard by the Task Force.
The Task Force also met officers of the GIDC, elected representatives, officers from the Government Departments, NGOs and individuals.
The Task Force consisted of Shri Charles Correa, eminent architect as the Vice Chairman, Shri Edgar Ribeiro, Advisor to Government of Goa, Dr. S.P. Deshpande and Shri Datta Naik, representatives of Goa Chamber of Housing Industry, Shri Blaise Costa Bir, representative of Goa Chamber of Commerce Industry, Shri Dean Dcruz, the Chairman of Indian Institute of Architects, Goa and Shri Rahul Deshpande.
The conclusion recorded in the Resolution is that the SEZs are detrimental to the overall interest of Goa.
The seven points which are enumerated therein read thus 1)
It is perceived that Goa will not have a substantial revenue benefit by means of direct and indirect taxes through SEZs.2)
The State will have to incur expenditure to provide for infrastructure outside the SEZ area such as roads and other services.
Also the State will be liable to provide for services such as water and power within the SEZ in case the Developer fails to do so.
This would be an additional burden on the State exchequer.3)
The employment benefit derived through SEZs will not accrue largely to locals and it will lead to large scale migration of people thereby causing pressure on land and resources.4)
A huge amount of land has been blocked for product specific SEZs who seem to have invested on seemingly speculative grounds without specific data and analysis, for a large period of time, without any Government control.
This will deprive genuine entrepreneurs and companies which require land for setting up industrial units which are not product specific and not dependent on Government incentives.5)
The entire process of land allotment to SEZs has also to be seen in light of governments role in land acquisition for government projects of public purpose visavis allotment of Government acquired land to private developers.6)
The process of permitting SEZs in Goa is in conflict with the letter and spirit of the 73rd Amendment to the Constitution of India.7)
The intention of permitting SEZs which is that of industrialization and consequent employment generation can be served without SEZs if incentives are extended to incoming industries.
The required industrial development can be achieved if government focuses on providing excellent infrastructure in terms of roads, water and power to incoming industrial units.73.
This report of the Task Force was considered by the Cabinet Committee on infrastructure which met on 31st December, 2007.
The minutes of the meeting placed on record show that the Cabinet Committee considered the white paper prepared by the Chief Secretary and the Resolution dated 27th December, 2007 of the Task Force on Regional Plan of 2021.
The decision taken by the Cabinet SubCommittee reads thusThe Committee observed that there was considerable agitation among the people of Goa about the approval given for setting up various SEZs in our small State.
In deference to the wishes of the people as well as the Report of the GPCC SubCommittee and the resolution adopted by the R.P. Task Force, the Committee took the following decisions(a)
In view of the serious concern regarding strain on the States resources and infrastructure without commensurate benefits, expected large scale migration of people, resultant social tensions and overall shortage of land, it was decided to do away with the SEZs in the present form.(b)
Out of the 15 SEZ applications recommended to the Govt. of India for approval by the State government, no decision has been taken in respect of 8 cases which were kept on hold by the present Government pending a final decision in the matter.

Since under the relevant Act and Rules, only the GOI is empowered to approve and notify the SEZs, it was decided to take up the matter with the GOI and recommend that the approvals notifications in these 3 cases may be withdrawn and the cases denotified.(e)
Pending a final decision from the GOI and in view of the social tensions in the area, it was decided to direct the concerned parties not to take up further work on the ground in pursuance of the approval given till the matter is finally resolved in consultation with the GOI.74.
The submission of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Petitioners in the Petitions filed by the Companies was that the Cabinet SubCommittee was influenced by only the public outcry and the report of the SubCommittee appointed by the Ruling Congress Party.
Another criticism was that what is placed on record was the Resolution passed by the Task Force which records the recommendation but not the reasons.
It must be stated here that the Task Force consisted of eminent Architects and the representatives of the Goa Chamber of Housing Industries as well as Goa Chamber and Commerce Industry.
The Task Force does not appear to be influenced by the public outcry.
One of the major considerations by the Task Force is that the State of Goa will not have substantial benefit by setting up of a SEZ.
It is observed that the State would be liable to provide for services such as water and electricity supply in case developers fail to do so which will be additional burden on the State exchequer.
Another important aspect considered by the Task Force is that the huge amount of land has been blocked for product specified SEZs who seem to have invested on speculative grounds without specific data and analysis.
This will deprive genuine entrepreneurs and the Companies which require lands for setting up industrial units.
As pointed out earlier, the substantial parts of the lands acquired for setting up industrial estates by the GIDC have been allotted to the RespondentsCompanies for developing SEZs.
Another aspect considered is that the employment benefits which will be derived through SEZs will not accrue largely to locals and it will lead to a large scale migration of people thereby causing pressure on land and resources.
It was be noted here that in a public interest Writ Petition, information obtained from the employment exchange has been placed on record which shows that there were about 80,000 unemployed persons in the State and whereas the companies projected that more than 3,00,000 jobs will be created by the SEZs.
All this has to be appreciated in the light of the fact that Goa is a very small State having limited resources.
The Cabinet Committee on infrastructure noted the serious concern regarding strain on States resources and infrastructure without commensurate benefits.
The Committee also considered overall shortage of land and accepted the possibility of a large scale migration of the people to the small State like Goa and resultant social tensions.
The minutes of the Cabinet Committee also record that the members of the Committee included the Honble Chief Minister, Home Minister, Ministers of Public Works Department, Revenue and Health.
The minutes also record that the said Ministers also shared the details of their interaction with the various stake holders including the NGOs Civil Action Groups, etc.75.
The Committee has also noted what is set out in the white paper.
It was contended that the decision of the Cabinet Committee is based only on the recommendation of a Study Committee of the Ruling Congress Party.
The Cabinet Committee has considered the report of the Task Force which consisted of experts.
The members of the committee had interaction with various stakeholders.
The report of the Cabinet Committee consisting of Senior Ministers including the Honble Chief Minister has been ratified by the Cabinet.
Thus, it cannot be said that the policy decision is based only on the irrelevant considerations.
The decision is based on consideration of public interest.76.
It cannot be held that the State Government is not competent to take a policy decision that there should be no SEZ in the state.
Even if the Central Government decides to suo moto set up SEZ, the proviso to Subsection (3) of Section 3 of the SEZ Act requires the Central Government to consult the State Government.
In case an application is made by any person intending to set up SEZ under Subsection (2) of Section 3, the proposal requires recommendation of the State Government.
Even if such application is directly made to the Board, even after grant of approval, without concurrence of the State Government, Notification establishing SEZ cannot be issued.
Thus, the State Government certainly has a role to play and can always take a policy decision on the issue whether SEZs can be set up in the State.77.
The limitations of power of this Court exercising writ jurisdiction while dealing with the policy matters are well settled.
In the present case, it cannot be said that only on the ground of public outcry, the policy decision has been taken.
The policy decision is based on consideration of various factors including the report of the Task Force which comprised of the wellknown experts.
The Task Forces, before taking decision, had given hearing to all the companies and all concerned persons.
The Cabinet Committee on infrastructure consisted of senior ministers including the Honourable Chief Minister.
The ministers concerned were members of the Cabinet Committee had interaction with all the stakeholders before the decision was taken.
Apart from the report of GPCC, the Committee has considered the White Paper prepared by the Chief Secretary.
In the circumstances, it is not possible to hold that the decision of the State Government to withdraw from SEZ Policy is arbitrary and that it is based only on public outcry.
An argument has been canvassed across the bar that the industrial policy adopted by the Government of Goa for the year 2003 makes a reference to the establishment of setting up of SEZs.
It must be stated here that the said industrial policy was formulated prior to coming into force of the SEZ Act and the Policy of 2006 is a policy regarding setting up of SEZ in terms of the SEZ Act.
After the SEZ Act came into force, the SEZs can be established only under the said Act.
The Policy formulated in the year 2006 has been withdrawn by a subsequent policy decision approved by the Council of Ministers.78.
The limitations on the power of the Court to interfere in policy matters are well known.
In the case of Federation of Rly.
Officers Assn. v. Union of India, (2003) 4 SCC 289 , the Apex Court, in paragraph 12 held thus12.
In examining a question of this nature where a policy is evolved by the Government judicial review thereof is limited.
When policy according to which or the purpose for which discretion is to be exercised is clearly expressed in the statute, it cannot be said to be an unrestricted discretion.
On matters affecting policy and requiring technical expertise the court would leave the matter for decision of those who are qualified to address the issues.
Unless the policy or action is inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws or arbitrary or irrational or abuse of power, the court will not interfere with such matters.
(emphasis added)In the case of DDA v. Joint Action Committee, Allottee of SFS Flats, (2008) 2 SCC 672 , the Apex Court observed in paragraph 64 thus64.
An executive order termed as a policy decision is not beyond the pale of judicial review.
Whereas the superior courts may not interfere with the nittygritty of the policy, or substitute one by the other but it will not be correct to contend that the court shall lay its judicial hands off, when a plea is raised that the impugned decision is a policy decision.
Interference therewith on the part of the superior court would not be without jurisdiction as it is subject to judicial review.65.
Broadly, a policy decision is subject to judicial review on the following grounds(a) if it is unconstitutional(b) if it is dehors the provisions of the Act and the regulations(c) if the delegatee has acted be yond its power of delegation(d) if the executive policy is con trary to the statutory or a larger policy.
In the decision by the Apex Court in the Case of Ugar Sugar Works Ltd. v. Delhi Admn., (2001) 3 SCC 635 , in paragraph 18, it was observed as under18.
The challenge, thus, in effect, is to the executive policy regulating trade in liquor in Delhi.
It is well settled that the courts, in exercise of their power of judicial review, do not ordinarily interfere with the policy decisions of the executive unless the policy can be faulted on grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or unfairness etc.
Indeed, arbitrariness, irrationality, perversity and mala fide will render the policy unconstitutional.
However, if the policy cannot be faulted on any of these grounds, the mere fact that it would hurt business interests of a party, does not justify invalidating the policy.
In tax and economic regulation cases, there are good reasons for judicial restraint, if not judicial deference, to judgment of the executive.
The courts are not expected to express their opinion as to whether at a particular point of time or in a particular situation any such policy should have been adopted or not.
It is best left to the discretion of the State.
(emphasis added)In the present cases, the companies have not shown any breach of the constitutional provisions.
The role played by a State Government under the scheme of SEZ Act is already discussed in detail.
It is for the state to decide whether a recommendation can be made or consent can be given for setting up SEZ in the state and therefore, the state has power to formulate policy in that behalf.
There are no mala fides alleged or shown.
The policy decision is stated to be taken in public interest.
It is based on consideration of reports and relevant factors.
It is impossible to hold that the said policy decision of withdrawing the earlier policy is either arbitrary or illegal.
Another question is whether the doctrine of promissory estoppel will prevent the State Government from applying the said decision to the said companies.
The said aspect is discussed separately.
CONSIDERATION OF QUESTION (e)79.
The next question is regarding the legality of allotments made by the GIDC to various Companies for setting up of a SEZ.
The basic contention raised is that without inviting offers, the GIDC could not have allotted valuable lands to the Companies.
The main contention is that without making scrutiny of the applications made by the companies, allotment of very large lands was made by the GIDC in arbitrary manner.
It is contended that even the project reports are not filed by the companies along with their applications.
It is alleged that allotment has been hurriedly made due to intervention of the then the Chief Minister and the then the Minister of industries of the government of Goa.
When the application is made and considered by the GIDC, two companies were not even formed and registered.
The contention is that there is a complete non application of mind by the GIDC and the allotments lack transparency.
The other contention is that the GIDC had no power to grant lands acquired for industrial purposes for the purposes of setting up of SEZs and in any event, there was no direction issued by the State Government directing the GIDC to allot lands for setting up SEZs and the last contention on this aspect is that there are gross procedural irregularities and illegalities committed while hurriedly making allotments of the lands to the Companies.80.
On this issue, one factual aspect which is required to be noted is that the lands which have been allotted to the Companies have been admittedly acquired by exercising the powers under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act of 1894) for setting up industrial area or industrial estate.
It will be necessary to consider the relevant provisions of the GIDC Act.
The preamble of the Act provides for securing the orderly establishment in industrial areas and industrial estates of industries in the State of Goa and to assist generally in the organisation therefore.
Subsection (1) of Section 3 which deals with the incorporation of the GIDC which also provides that the GIDC shall be established for the purposes of securing and assisting in the rapid and orderly establishment and organisation of industries in industrial areas and industrial estates in Goa.
Sections 13 and 14 are very relevant which read thus13 Functions.
The functions of the Corporation shall be(i) Generally to promote and assist in the rapid and orderly establishment, growth and development of industries in the (State of Goa),(ii) in particular, and without prejudice to the generality of clause (i) to (a) establish and manage industrial estates at places selected by the State Government(b) develop industrial areas selected by the State Government for the purpose and make them available for undertakings to establish themselves(Deleted)(d)
Undertake schemes or works
either jointly or on agency basis with other corporate bodies or institutions, or with Government in furtherance of the purposes for which the Corporation is established and all matter connected therewith.14.
General powers of the Corporation.
Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Corporation shall have power (a) to acquire and hold such property, both movable and immovable as the Corporation may deem necessary for the performance of any of its activities, and to lease, sell, exchange or otherwise transfer any property held by it on such conditions as may be deemed proper by the Corporation(b) to provide or cause to be provided amenities and common facilities in industrial estates and industrial areas and construct and maintain or cause to be maintained works and buildings therefor(c) to make available buildings on hire or sale to industrialists or persons intending to start industrial undertakings(d) to construct buildings for the housing of the employees(e) to allot factory sheds or such buildings or parts of buildings, including residential tenements to suitable persons in the industrial estates established or developed by the Corporation(ii) to modify or rescind such allotments, including the right and power to evict the allottees concerned on breach of any of the terms or conditions of their allotment(f) to constitute advisory committee to advise the Corporation.(h) to engage suitable consultants or persons having special knowledge or skill to assist the Corporation in the performance of its functions(f) subject to the previous permission of the State Government, to delegate any of its powers generally or specially to any its committees or officers, and to permit them to redelegate specific powers to their subordinates to enter into and perform all such contracts as it may consider necessary or expedient for carrying out any of its functions, and(k) to do such other things and perform such acts as it may think necessary or expedient for the proper conduct of its functions and the carrying into effect the purposes of this Act.81.
One of the important functions of the GIDC is to promote rapid and orderly establishment, growth and development of the industries in the State of Goa.
The Act contemplates setting up of an industrial area as well as setting up of an industrial estate.
Section 37A of the GIDC Act empowers the State Government to declare by a notification in the official gazette an industrial area.
Subclause (1) of Clause (a) of Subsection 1 thereof provides that an area earmarked as an industrial estate can be declared as an industrial area subject to satisfaction of the other conditions incorporated in the section.
An industrial estate is defined by clause (h) of Section 2 which means any site selected by the State Government where the Corporation builds factories and other buildings and makes them available for any industries or class of industries.82.
Clause (a) of Section 14 of the GIDC Act empowers the GIDC to lease, sell, exchange or otherwise transfer any property held by it.
Under Clause (d) thereof, the GIDC has power to construct buildings for the housing of the employees and to allot residential tenements to suitable persons in the industrial estate established or developed by the Corporation.
Another relevant section is Section 16 which reads thus16.
Directions by the State Government.
The State Government may issue to the Corporation such general or special directions as to policy as it may think necessary or expedient for the purpose of carrying out the purposes of this Act, and the Corporation shall be bound to follow and act upon such directions.
Section 28 will have to be considered in this context which reads thus28.
Disposal of land by the Corporation.(1) Subject to any directions given by the State Government under this Act, the Corporation may dispose of (a) any land acquired by the State Government and transferred to it, without undertaking or carrying out any development thereon or(b) any such land after undertaking or carrying out development as it thinks fit, to such persons in such manner and subject to such terms and conditions, as it considers expedient for securing the purposes of this Act.(2)
The powers of the Corporation with respect to the disposal of land under subsection (1) shall be so exercised as to secure so far as practicable, that (a) where the Corporation proposes to dispose of by sale any such land without any development having been undertaken or carried out thereon, the Corporation shall offer the land in the first instance to the person from whom it was acquired, if they desire to purchase it, subject to such requirements as to its development and use as the Corporation may think fit to impose(b) persons who are residing or carrying on business or other activities on any such land shall, if they desire to obtain accommodation on land belonging to the Corporation and are willing to comply with any requirements of the Corporation as to its development and use, have as opportunity to obtain thereon accommodation suitable to their reasonable requirements on terms settled with due regard to the price at which any such land has been acquired from them.(3) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as enabling the Corporation without the approval of the State Government to dispose of land by way of gift, mortgage or charge, but subject as aforesaid any reference in this Act to the disposal of land shall be construed as a reference to the disposal thereof in any manner, whether by way of sale, exchange or lease or by the creation of any easement, right or privilege or otherwise.83.
Under Clause (a) of Subsection (1) of Section 28 of the GIDC Act, any land acquired by the State Government and transferred to it, without undertaking or carrying out any development thereon can be disposed of by the GIDC.
Under clause (b), the lands can be disposed of after carrying out development thereon.
Under Clause (a) of Subsection (2) of Section 28, it is provided that where the GIDC proposes to dispose of by sale any such land without any development thereon, the same has to be offered in the first instance to the person from whom it was acquired.84.
Under the GIDC Act, no specific mode or method of disposal of lands has been prescribed.
Under Section 51 of the GIDC Act, there is a power to make regulations.
It is not in dispute that there are no regulations made laying down the mode or method for disposal of lands by the GIDC.
The GIDC can acquire the lands in accordance with Section 27 of the GIDC Act.
Under Section 29 of the GIDC Act, the State Government is empowered to place at the disposal of the Corporation any lands vesting in the Government upon such conditions as may be agreed upon between the Government and the GIDC.
Thus, the GIDC can hold lands which are either acquired under the said Act of 1894 or which are vested in it by the State Government.
In the present case, we are concerned with the lands acquired under the said Act of 1984.
Therefore, the lands which are available at the disposal of the GIDC are public properties and, therefore, the GIDC is under an obligation to sell or transfer the lands by acting fairly.
In the case of Meerut Development Authority v. Assn. of Management Studies,((2009) 6 SCC 17), in paragraph 28 the Apex Court has observed thus 28.
It is so well settled in law and needs no restatement at our hands that disposal of the public property by the State or its instrumentalities partakes the character of a trust.
The methods to be adopted for disposal of public property must be fair and transparent providing an opportunity to all the interested persons to participate in the process.
(emphasis added)The Apex Court in the case of Sachidanand Pandey v. State of W.B. ((1987) 2 SCC 29), held thus 40.
On a consideration of the relevant cases cited at the Bar the following propositions may be taken as well established Stateowned or publicowned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive.
Certain precepts and principles have to be observed.
Public interest is the paramount consideration.
One of the methods of securing the public interest, when it is considered necessary to dispose of a property, is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders.
Though that is the ordinary rule, it is not an invariable rule.
There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule but then the reasons for the departure must be rational and should not be suggestive of discrimination.
Appearance of public justice is as important as doing justice.
Nothing should be done which gives an appearance of bias, jobbery or nepotism.
(emphasis added)In the very well known decision of the Apex Court in the case of Ram Shyam Co. v. State of Haryana, ((1985) 3 SCC 26) laid down that 12.
Let us put into focus the clearly demarcated approach that distinguishes the use and disposal of private property and socialist property.
Owner of private property may deal with it in any manner he likes without causing injury to any one else.
But the socialist or if that word is jarring to some, the community or further the public property has to be dealt with for public purpose and in public interest.
The marked difference lies in this that while the owner of private property may have a number of considerations which may permit him to dispose of his property for a song.
On the other hand, disposal of public property partakes the character of a trust in that in its disposal there should be nothing hanky panky and that it must be done at the best price so that larger revenue coming into the coffers of the State administration would serve public purpose viz.
the welfare State may be able to expand its beneficent activities by the availability of larger funds.
This is subject to one important limitation that socialist property may be disposed at a price lower than the market price or even for a token price to achieve some defined constitutionally recognised public purpose, one such being to achieve the goals set out in Part IV of the Constitution.
But where disposal is for augmentation of revenue and nothing else, the State is under an obligation to secure the best market price available in a market economy.
An owner of private property need not auction it nor is he bound to dispose it of at a current market price.
Factors such as personal attachment, or affinity, kinship, empathy, religious sentiment or limiting the choice to whom he may be willing to sell, may permit him to sell the property at a song and without demur.
A welfare State as the owner of the public property has no such freedom while disposing of the public property.
A welfare State exists for the largest good of the largest number more so when it proclaims to be a socialist State dedicated to eradication of poverty.
All its attempt must be to obtain the best available price while disposing of its property because the greater the revenue, the welfare activities will get a fillip and shot in the arm.
Financial constraint may weaken the tempo of activities.
Such an approach serves the larger public purpose of expanding welfare activities primarily for which the Constitution envisages the setting up of a welfare State.
In this connection we may profitably refer to Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India6 in which Bhagwati, J. speaking for the Court observed (SCC p. 506, para 12)It must, therefore, be taken to be the law that where the Government is dealing with the public, whether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts or issuing quotas or licences or granting other forms of largesse, the Government cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and, like a private individual, deal with any person it pleases, but its action must be in conformity with standard or norms which is not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant.
The power or discretion of the Government in the matter of grant of largesse including award of jobs, contracts, quotas, licences etc. must be confined and structured by rational, relevant and nondiscriminatory standard or norm and if the Government departs from such standard or norm in any particular case or cases, the action of the Government would be liable to be struck down, unless it can be shown by the Government that the departure was not arbitrary, but was based on some valid principle which in itself was not irrational, unreasonable or discriminatory.
At another place it was observed that the Government must act in public interest, it cannot act arbitrarily or without reason and if it does so, its action would be liable to be invalidated.
It was further observed that the object of holding the auction is generally to raise the highest revenue.
The Government is entitled to reject the highest bid if it thought that the price offered was inadequate.
But after rejecting the offer, it is obligatory upon the Government to act fairly and at any rate it cannot act arbitrarily.
(emphasis added)Another landmark decision of the Apex Court which is material on this aspect is in the case of Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of J K, ((1980) 4 SCC 1 ).
In paragraph 11, the Apex Court held thus11.
So far as the first limitation is concerned, it flows directly from the thesis that, unlike a private individual, the State cannot act as it pleases in the matter of giving largess.
Though ordinarily a private individual would be guided by economic considerations of selfgain in any action taken by him, it is always open to him under the law to act contrary to his selfinterest or to oblige another in entering into a contract or dealing with his property.
But the Government is not free to act as it likes in granting largess such as awarding a contract or selling or leasing out its property.
Whatever be its activity, the Government is still the Government and is, subject to restraints inherent in its position in a democratic society.
The constitutional power conferred on the Government cannot be exercised by it arbitrarily or capriciously or in an unprincipled manner it has to be exercised for the public good.
Every activity of the Government has a public element in it and it must therefore, be informed with reason and guided by public interest.
Every action taken by the Government must be in public interest the Government cannot act arbitrarily and without reason and if it does, its action would be liable to be invalidated.
If the Government awards a contract or leases out or otherwise deals with its property or grants any other largess, it would be liable to be tested for its validity on the touchstone of reasonableness and public interest and if it fails to satisfy either test, it would be unconstitutional and invalid.
In paragraphs 14 and 15 of its judgment, the Apex Court proceeded to observe thus14.
Where any governmental action fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness and public interest discussed above and is found to be wanting in the quality of reasonableness or lacking in the element of public interest, it would be liable to be struck down as invalid.
It must follow as a necessary corollary from this proposition that the Government cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the State such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary to public interest.
The Government, therefore, cannot, for example, give a contract or sell or lease out its property for a consideration less than the highest that can be obtained for it, unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest to do so.
Such considerations may be that some directive principle is sought to be advanced or implemented or that the contract or the property is given not with a view to earning revenue but for the purpose of carrying out a welfare scheme for the benefit of a particular group or section of people deserving it or that the person who has offered a higher consideration is not otherwise fit to be given the contract or the property.
We have referred to these considerations only illustratively, for there may be an infinite variety of considerations which may have to be taken into account by the Government in formulating its policies and it is on a total evaluation of various considerations which have weighed with the Government in taking a particular action, that the court would have to decide whether the action of the Government is reasonable and in public interest.
But one basic principle which must guide the court in arriving at its determination on this question is that there is always a presumption that the governmental action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest.
This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the court by proper and adequate material.
The court cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the Government is unreasonable or without public interest because, as we said above, there are a large number of policy considerations which must necessarily weigh with the Government in taking action and therefore the court would not strike down governmental action as invalid on this ground, unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is unreasonable or not in public interest.
But where it is so satisfied, it would be the plainest duty of the court under the Constitution to invalidate the governmental action.
This is one of the most important functions of the court and also one of the most essential for preservation of the rule of law.
It is imperative in a democracy governed by the rule of law that governmental action must be kept within the limits of the law and if there is any transgression, the court must be ready to condemn it.
It is a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency in every Government to assume more and more powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in some countries that the legislative check is getting diluted, it is left to the court as the only other reviewing authority under the Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure observance with the rule of law and in this task, the court must not flinch or falter.
It may be pointed out that this ground of invalidity, namely, that the governmental action is unreasonable or lacking in the quality of public interest, is different from that of mala fides though it may, in a given case, furnish evidence of mala fides.15.
The second limitation on the discretion of the Government in grant of largess is in regard to the persons to whom such largess may be granted.
It is now well settled as a result of the decision of this Court in Ramana D. Shetty v. International Airport Authority of India1 that the Government is not free, like an ordinary individual, in selecting the recipients for its largess and it cannot choose to deal with any person it pleases in its absolute and unfettered discretion.
The law is now wellestablished that the Government need not deal with anyone, but if it does so, it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure.
Where the Government is dealing with the public whether by way of giving jobs or entering into contracts or granting other forms of largess, the Government cannot act arbitrarily at its sweet will and, like a private individual, deal with any person it pleases, but its action must be in conformity with some standard or norm which is not arbitrary, irrational or irrelevant.
The governmental action must not be arbitrary or capricious, but must be based on some principle which meets the test of reason and relevance.
This rule was enunciated by the court as a rule of administrative law and it was also validated by the court as an emanation flowing directly from the doctrine of equality embodied in Article 14.
(emphasis added)In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court, the GIDC cannot arbitrarily allot lands vested in it and the alienations made by the GIDC must stand the test of reasonableness.
The allotment of the public properties vested in the GIDC can be made only in a fair and transparent manner and that also in public interest.
Therefore, the action of allotment of large tracts of lands to the companies will have to be tested on the touchstone of reasonableness.85.
For testing the reasonableness of the action, certain factual aspects will to be considered.
Before turning to the factual aspects, an argument made on behalf of GIDC will have to be considered.
There is an argument canvassed that there was a direction issued under Section 16 of the GIDC Act by the State Government under which the GIDC was obliged to allot the lands for setting up SEZs.
It must be stated here that no such specific direction under Section 16 of the GIDC Act is placed on record of any of the Petitions.
In case of allotment of land at Keri to the Meditab Specialities Private Limited(the Petitioners in Writ Petition no.380 of 2008), there is a Note dated 13th March, 2006 signed by the Minister of Industries which merely records that we may direct Goa IDC under Section 16 read with Section 28 of the GIDC Act, 1965 to allot 250 acres of the land at Keri to the said Company.
However, there is nothing on record to show that the state Government had taken any such decision to issue a direction.
Moreover, no such direction is produced on record.
What is stated in the Note dated 13th March, 2006 is merely a proposal to issue a direction in case of one company.
On this aspect, it will be material to note the stand taken by the GIDC in their affidavit in reply in Writ Petition No.314 of 2008.
The GIDC has relied upon several letters and note dated 13th March, 2006 to which reference is made earlier.
The affidavit refers to applications forwarded from the office of the Chief Minister or the Industries Minister.
Even in the said affidavit in reply, there is no reference to any specific direction issued under Section 16 of the GIDC Act.
Therefore, it can be safely concluded that there was no direction issued by the State Government in exercise of powers under Section 16 of the GIDC Act to allot any land for the purposes of setting up SEZs.86.
A contention was raised in the Public Interest Petitions that the GIDC has no power to allot lands vesting in it for the purposes of setting up SEZs.
Under the SEZ Act, the SEZ is defined to mean the one which is notified under Subsection (1) of Section 4.
Under Section 6 of the SEZ Act, it is provided that the areas falling within the SEZs may be demarcated as processing area for setting up units for activities being the manufacture of goods, or rendering services, or exclusively for trading or warehousing purposes, or as nonprocessing areas for activities other than those specified earlier.
Section 6 indicates that in SEZ, there may be an area which is for rendering services or which is exclusively used for trading or warehousing purposes.
Clause (c) of Section 6 contemplates that there can be nonprocessing areas which are not used for manufacture of goods.
There can be areas for rendering services for trading or warehousing purposes.
In SEZ Act, a Unit has been defined under Clause z(c) of Section 2 to mean and include an Offshore Banking Unit and a Unit in an International Financial Services Centre.
Under the SEZ Rules, the term infrastructure which is to be provided for SEZ is defined under Clause (s) of Rule 2 which includes warehouses, airports, railways, hospitals, hotels, educational institutions, leisure, recreational and entertainment facilities, residential and business complex, etc.
Coming back to the provisions of the GIDC Act, the basic function of GIDC is to promote and assist establishment, growth and development of industries.
The general power to sell or transfer under Clause (a) to Section 14 can be exercised for discharging the functions incorporated under Section 13.
As pointed out earlier, in view of Section 6 of the SEZ Act, there can be a SEZ which may not have processing area for activities of manufacture of goods.
In a given case, the SEZ may consists of area for rendering services, area exclusively used for trading or warehousing or a nonprocessing area, or for other activities, such as hospitals, hotels, educational institutions, recreational and entertainment facilities, residential and business complexes etc.
In a given case, area of SEZ may be used predominantly for industrial use or for the use of manufacture of goods.
The power under Clause (a) of Section 14 of the Transfer of Lands vesting in GIDC can be exercised only with a view to ensure establishment, growth and development of industries.
Therefore, the exercise of power under Section 14 for grant of land for setting up SEZs will depend on the factual situation such as the purpose for which it is going to be used by the SEZ.
If the land is to be allotted or transferred to SEZ predominantly for promoting or establishing or developing industries, then the power to allot can be lawfully exercised.87.
Now coming to the factual details of allotment of the lands, on 12th April, 2006, there were four applications made to the GIDC.
The said four applications were made by M s. K. Raheja Corporation Private Limited(Petitioners in W.P. no.349 of 2008) for allotment of area of 7,91,732 sq. meters, M s. Paradigm Logistics Distributions Private Limited(Petitioners in W.P. no.501 of 2008) for allotment of area of 2,64,419 sq. meters, M s. Inox Mercantile Co.
Pvt. Ltd.
(Petitioners in W.P. no.438 of 2008) for allotment of land of an area of 4,84,832 sq. meters, and M s. Plannet View Mercantile Company Private Limited(Petitioners in W.P. no.438 of 2008) for allotment of an area of 1,32,000 sq. meters.
Much is said about the fact that in the applications some portion is handwritten and two applications are signed by the same person Shri Jawinder Singh.
It is stated that the applications do not bear the seals of the respective Companies.
It is pointed out that the applications were made for specific plots.
The applications along with forwarding letters have been produced by the GIDC.
It is pointed out that all the four covering letters bear consecutive inward numbers of GIDC.It is alleged that the covering letters are fabricated.
A letter dated 11th April, 2006 written by Shri Neel Raheja is placed on record on which an endorsement of the Honble Chief Minister of Goa is please help these people.
On 17th April, 2006, certain amounts were deposited by all the four applicants by way of security deposits.
It is pointed out that 287th Board meeting of the GIDC was scheduled to be held on 19th April, 2006 of which a notice was issued on 12th April, 2006.
It is mentioned in the notice that the agenda was to follow shortly.
It is pointed out that the draft agenda of the meeting was kept for approval of the Managing Director on 18th April, 2006 which is reflected from the Page No.1095 of Writ Petition No.316 of 2008.
In the meeting held on 19th April, 2006, all the four applications were approved.
Approval was granted to allotment of an area of 5,52,089 to M s. Inox Mercantile Company Private Limited when in the original application dated 12th April, 2006 a request was made for allotment of area of 4,84,089.88.
What is material to note is that the applications dated 12th April 2006 were for allotment of a large area of more than 16,50,000 square meters made together by four Companies and the same were hurriedly approved in the meeting held on 19th April, 2006.
In the said applications which were made in the same format, some portions are handwritten which appear to be in the same handwriting.
Nothing is placed on record to show whether any project reports were submitted by the said Companies, whether any scrutiny of the said applications was made and whether credentials of the Companies were examined.
It is not known in what manner scrutiny of the applications seeking allotment of 16,50,000 square meters of public property was made by a statutory authority like GIDC.
In fact a copy of lease deed of the land allotted to the Planet View Mercantile Company Private Limited shows that the date of incorporation of the said company is 26th April 2006.
Hence when a decision to allot a land admeasuring 1,32,000 square meters was taken, the company was not even registered.
Thus, a decision was taken to allot a large public land out of an industrial estate to a company which was not even registered.
Learned counsel appearing for the Companies tried to submit that though there is material to show that there was a scrutiny, the said material is not at all placed on record as the State Government and the GIDC are now against the Companies.
However, the Companies have not placed on record any material on record to show that apart from simple applications dated 12th April 2006 any other documents were placed on record of GIDC.
Copies of noting sheets of the files of the GIDC obtained under the Right to Information Act placed on record of W.P No.316 of 2008 show that files on the basis of the said applications were opened by GIDC on 17th April 2006.
The agenda of meeting of 19th April 2006 was submitted for approval of the Managing director on 18th April 2006 and was forwarded to the members on the same day.
One important aspect which cannot be ignored is that within a span of 7 days from the date of the applications, the allotment of lands admeasuring about 17,00,000 sq. meters was made by the GIDC.
On the face of it, there is arbitrariness in the action of the GIDC.89.
Now turning to the allotment made to M s. Meditab Specialities Private Limited (Petitioners in W.P. no.380 of 2008), as stated earlier, the allotment was made in respect of the land admeasuring 12,32,000 sq. meters at Keri which was acquired for setting up an industrial estate.
The allotment was of the entire land acquired for the industrial area.
On 7th March, 2006, the said company wrote a letter to the Minister for Industries of the Government of Goa requesting for grant of minimum of 150 acres of land at Keri in order to set up pharmaceuticals and chemical SEZ.
An endorsement is made by the Minister on the said application to the Managing Director of the GIDC informing him to take action in the matter.
There is a reminder dated 10th March, 2006 sent by M s. Meditab Specialties Private Limited to the Minister.
On the next day i.e. 11th March, 2006, M s. Meditab Specialties Private Limited wrote a letter to the Minister that an area of 250 acres should be allotted instead of 150 acres.
On 13th March, 2006, there was a note issued signed by the Minister of Industries in which he has stated we may direct the Goa IDC under Section 16 to allot 250 acres of land to M s. Meditab Specialties Private Limited.
It is already held that what is mentioned in the Note is a mere recommendation and not a direction under Section 16 which is required to be issued by the State Government.
Again on 13th March, 2006, the Meditab Specialties Private Limited wrote another letter to the Minister for allotment of land which is again endorsed to the Managing Director of GIDC.
On 20th March, 2006, the Ministry forwarded letters dated 7th March, 2006, 10th March, 2006 and 13th March, 2006 to the GIDC.
On 24th March, 2006, there is a letter by the Meditab Specialties Private Limited addressed to the Industries Minister with a copy to the GIDC that the Government of India will be meeting somewhere in April, 2006 to consider the proposals received by Ministry of Commerce for setting up of a SEZ.
It must be noted that the letter of allotment dated 29th March 2006 addressed to Meditab Specialties Private Limited by the GIDC makes a reference to the direction of the State Government.
The letter dated 27th March 2006 sent by the said company to GIDC makes a reference to the discussion with the Managing Director of the GIDC on the subject and the offer given by the Meditab Specialties Private Limited to take up the entire 300 acres of the land for setting up SEZ.
On 28th March, 2006, the GIDC resolved to allot the entire land admeasuring 12,32,000 sq. meters to Meditab Specialties Private Limited.
Thus, Meditab Specialties Private Limited on 7th March, 2006 started with an application for allotment of land admeasuring about 150 acres and on 28th March 2006, the said Company successfully secured an allotment of land admeasuring approximately 300 Acres which constitutes the entire acquired land for setting up of an industrial estate at Keri.
The letter dated 29th March, 2006 sent by the Managing Director of GIDC to M s. Meditab Specialties Private Limited refers to a direction from the State Government.
In Writ Petition No.314 of 2008 on page 657, there is a file noting dated 28th April, 2006 which refers to a direction of the Honble Chief Minister to issue land allotment order to M s. Meditab Specialties Private Limited and to report compliance.
Accordingly, on the same day allotment order was issued to M s. Meditab Specialties Private Limited.
As held earlier, the Government of Goa never issued any direction under Section 16 of the GIDC as Act regards the allotment of lands for SEZ.
It must be also noted that all applications starting from 10th March 2006 were addressed to The Minister of Industries and not to the GIDC.
Even in this case there is nothing on record to show that even a project report was submitted to GIDC and that any kind of scrutiny was made by The GIDC to examine the credentials, financial status and the experience of the company.90.
The Pennisula Research Centre Private Limited (Petitioners in W.P.No.436 of 2008) made an application to GIDC on 2nd March 2006 for allotment of a land admeasuring about 2,00,000 square meters at Sancoale .
The application was made for allotment of land for establishment of research and development centre for drugs and pharmaceutical industries including biotechnology centre.
When the application was made, the said company was not even admittedly formed .The application specifically records that the said company was under formation.
Moreover the said application does not record that the land is required for setting up SEZ.
There is another letter dated 9th March 2006 addressed by the said company to the Honble Chief Minister requesting for grant of land for an export processing zone.
There is not even a reference in the said letter to a proposal for setting up of SEZ.
This letter is an Annexure to the affidavit in reply of GIDC which does not bear any inward entry or rubber stamp either of the office of the Chief Minister or the GIDC.
Though said letter was not sent to the GIDC, there is a note sent by its Managing Director on the same day suggesting that the application could be considered for the allotment of land at Sancoale industrial estate for the said project.
There is a noting made thereon by the Chief Secretary of the Government of Goa recording that EPZ is not allowed and SEZs are allowed for which an application was required to be made under SEZ Act and Rules.
Another letter was addressed by the said company on 13th March 2006 to the Minister for Industries of the Government of Goa for grant of approval for setting up Export Processing Zone for research and development centre Bio Technology Park on the land acquired by the GIDC.
On the said, letter, there is a note made by the Minister in principle approval may be given.
There is not even a reference in the said letter to a proposal for setting up SEZ.
It is pertinent to note that approval was granted to the allotment of land in the meeting of the Board of the GIDC held on 28th March 2006.
The agenda item number 5 is regarding the request received by the Government of Goa from the said company for setting up Export Processing Zone for research and development centre and biotechnology Park.
The resolution No.30 passed in the meeting records that it was resolved to grant land admeasuring 2,03,650 square meters at the negotiated rate of not less than Rs.250 per square meter to the said company for setting up research and development centre bio technology park SEZ.
Thus it is clear that none of the 3 applications made by the said company which were on record contained a request for grant of land for the purpose of setting up SEZ.
It is not the case made out that any other application apart from the said 3 applications was made by the said company.
Moreover, the board of the GIDC did not consider the application made by the said company on 2nd March 2006.
From the resolution passed by the board it appears that what was considered by the board was a request made by the said company to the State Government to allot the land.
There is no communication in writing by the state government in that behalf except for the noting made by the Industries Minister in principle approval be given.
There is a note of the Chief Secretary which records that the managing director should advise the said company to apply under the SEZ Act.
There is no request either by the said company or by the State Government to allot the land for setting up a Special Economic Zone though the Resolution passed by the Board makes a reference to it.
Even in this Case, there is nothing placed on record to show that any scrutiny of the application of the said Company was made.
In fact the decision of the Board shows that the Application made by the said company to GIDC was not considered by the board and what was considered was the request of the government.90A. Now turning to the allotment of land made to the Maxgrow Finlease Pvt Ltd (the Petitioners in Writ Petition no.507 of 2008), the application dated 2nd may 2006 was not made by the said company, but by another company the JMD Promoters Ltd for allotment of the land admeasuring 2,00,000 square metres in Verna industrial estate.
The same company made another application on 25th of May 2006 to the Managing Director of the GIDC requesting that the allotment be made in favour of Maxgrow Finlease Pvt Ltd.
On the same day, the JMD Promoters Ltd wrote a letter to the Minister of Industries of the State Government requesting for allotment of a land for setting up a SEZ.
It is pertinent to note that the said application does not disclose the name of the company Maxgrow Finlease Pvt Ltd.
On 5th June 2006 the said letter was forwarded by the secretary of the Minister to the Managing Director of the GIDC.
A remark for necessary action was made by the Minister on the said letter addressed to him while forwarding the same to the managing Director of GIDC .
On 6th July 2006, the Board of the GIDC decided to allot land admeasuring 2,00,000 square metres to Maxgrow Finlease Pvt Ltd.
The letter of allotment issued shows that the allotment was made on the basis of applications dated 2nd May 2006 and 25th May 2006 made by the JMD Promoters Ltd.
None of the applications give any particulars or details about the said Petitioner .
Thus, the allotment made to the Petitioners is without any application of mind.
There is obviously no scrutiny of the credentials of said Petitioners.91.
To summarise, the four companies who made applications allegedly on 12th of April 2006 succeeded in getting allotment of lands admeasuring more than 16.5 lakh square metres within a span of 7 days.
As far as the Pennisula Research Centre Private Limited is concerned, the application made by the company to the GIDC on 2nd March 2006 which did not contain any reference to setting up of SEZ.
As stated earlier, the said application was not considered by the board and what was considered by the board was a request made by the State Government.
The said company made an application to the Chief Minister on 13th March 2006.
The resolution of the board allotting such a large land admeasuring 2,00,000 square meters was passed on 28th March 2006.
It is already pointed out that the company Meditab Specialties Private Limited made an application on 7th March 2006 for grant of land admeasuring 150 acres and within a short time, on 28th March 2006 succeeded in getting allotment of the entire industrial area admeasuring 300 acres.
In case of two companies, when applications were made and when the resolutions of allotments were passed, even the companies were not incorporated.
There is nothing on record to show that project reports were filed by the companies.
There is nothing on record to show that any further documents showing their experience and financial capacity were placed before the GIDC.
There is no application of mind by the GIDC.
Before allotment of such large lands there was absolutely no scrutiny of the applications and the applicants with reference to their experience in the field and financial capacity.
For the grant of very large lands which were acquired for public purpose, the applications were made by the companies were cryptic and the same were hurriedly considered and granted within few days without any scrutiny.
The total area of lands allotted in this fashion exceeds 30,00,000 sq. meters.
The action of allotment suffers from lack of fairness and transparency.
It is true that the allotment of public property need not be made by holding a public auction as a matter of rule.
However, the State or public authorities cannot act like private persons while disposing of the public properties.
A public authority can allot lands only to deserving and eligible persons after satisfying itself about the credibility and capacity of the person.
The procedure adopted while allotting public properties must be fair and transparent and the action has to be in the public interest.
Before the concerned authority comes to the conclusion and records subjective satisfaction that the proposed allotment is in public interest, at least some kind of scrutiny of the credentials of the applicants is mandatory.
In these cases allotment of large lands having area of more than 30,00,000 square meters was made to few companies within a span of few days or a few weeks.
Moreover, the action of allotment shows lack of application of mind.
Such huge lands which are public properties were allotted for the asking to the said companies in a manner not known to Law.
The action of allotment of lands is illegal being arbitrary and unreasonable.92.
It was sought to be argued on behalf of the Companies that there were no other takers for the lands allotted to the aforesaid companies.
As stated earlier, allotment of land to four companies has taken place within a span of 7 days and in the case of M s. Meditab Specialties Private Limited within a span of 21 days, the entire area of industrial estate at Keri was allotted.
There is nothing on record to show that other industries or entrepreneurs were made aware about the availability of such large lands.
The resolutions passed by the GIDC do not record that there were no other takers for the said lands.
Even assuming that on the date when applications were made by the said companies, there were no applications made by any third parties for the allotment of the said lands, there was no reason to make allotments in a great deal of haste and without any scrutiny of the applications.
It was sought to be contended that in the 1st week of April 2006, the Board of Approval under the SEZ Act was to meet and to take a decision to grant approval to certain number of SEZs throughout the country and therefore there was a great urgency.
This argument shows that the allotment was made hastily.
Thus, there is a complete arbitrariness in the allotment of lands by GIDC.
The allotment is not in respect of small plots of land but allotment is in respect of the lands which exceed an area of 30,00,000 sq. meter to selected few companies.
Assuming that in April, 2006, the Board was to hold a meeting and grant permission for setting up 100 SEZs, such huge public property could not have been allotted by the GIDC in such arbitrary and irrational manner.
We are not even going to the controversy about the rates at which the lands were allotted.
There is no transparency in the procedure for allotment of lands by the GIDC.The action was sought to be supported by contending that right from the date of incorporation of the GIDC, the lands were allotted without inviting offers.
In the present case, the question was of allotting very vast lands and in one case, the land constitutes the entire industrial estate.
Inference which can be drawn is that on the basis of the applications made by the Companies which were recommended either by the Minister Industries or by the Honble Chief Minister, the allotments were made for asking without bothering to examine the credentials of the Applicants and without making proper scrutiny.
The main function of the GIDC is to promote and assist orderly establishment, growth and development of industries in the State of Goa.
The exercise of powers under Section 14(a) of the GIDC Act must be aimed at achieving the said object.
Therefore, before making orders for allotment, examination and consideration of the basic issue as to whether allotment of such vast lands to the selected Companies will really promote and assist orderly establishment, growth and development of industries in the State of Goa was necessary.
When the allotment was sought to be made for SEZs, it was obvious that a large area could be used for nonprocessing projects or for the purposes of constructing shopping complexes, hotels, hospitals, residential complexes.
The question is without examining the project reports, could the GIDC allot such a vast lands to the Companies Even assuming that the GIDC could have done it without inviting offers from competitors, surely the GIDC without satisfying itself that the allotment was being made to deserving companies having good experience in the field with a view to promote orderly establishment, growth and development of industries in the State of Goa, could not have allotted such vast lands.
For recording such satisfaction, a scrutiny of financial status and capacity of the companies was mandatory especially when two of the companies were under formation.
In the circumstances, a finding will have to be recorded that the allotment of lands to the said Companies was not legal.93.
There were extensive submissions made in the public interest litigation based on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.
It is pointed out that serious irregularities and illegalities in the allotment of lands in favour of the Companies have been recorded in said report (hereinafter referred to as the CAG Report.)
Reliance is placed on Chapter VII of the said CAG Report and it was contended that to the several irregularities and illegalities pointed out in the report, there is no answer by the GIDC.
It must be noted at this stage that in view of Article 151 of the Constitution of India and in particular Clause (2) thereof, the report will have to be placed by the Honourable Governor before the Legislature of the State and it is for the Legislature for the State to take further steps in that behalf.
The report is recommendatory in nature and as of today, the same is not placed before the Legislature.
Therefore, the argument based on the CAG report cannot be taken into consideration.
CONSIDERATION OF QUESTION g94.
Another important issue which will have to be dealt with is based on the submissions made on the basis of doctrine of promissory estoppel.
We have already made a reference to the said submissions in some detail.
In the case of the Petitioners in writ petition No.349 of 2008, a case is made out that construction of buildings was started and that third party rights have been created.
The Petitioners in writ petition No.380 of 2008 contended that they have allotted a portion of the land to the Cipla limited.
We have already noted earlier that the petitioners have not placed on record any documentary evidence in the form of agreements executed in favour of the third parties.
Moreover, we have already pointed out that there are no approved units in the Special Economic Zones to be set up by the said two companies.
The argument which is common in the petitions of the companies is that a large amount has been spent towards payment of lease premium, lease rent, on planning and on the work of erection of fencing.
Thus the submission in short is that acting upon the recommendations of the State Government and the approvals notifications under the SEZ Act, the companies have altered their respective positions.95.
Reliance has been placed by the parties on various wellknown decisions of the Apex Court on the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
In the case of Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of U.P ((1979) 2 SCC 409 ), the Apex Court observed thatThe law may, therefore, now be taken to be settled as a result of this decision, that where the Government makes a promise knowing or intending that it would be acted on by the promisee and, in fact, the promisee, acting in reliance on it, alters his position, the Government would be held bound by the promise and the promise would be enforceable against the Government at the instance of the promisee, notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by Article 299 of the Constitution.
It is elementary that in a republic governed by the rule of law, no one, howsoever high or low, is above the law.
Everyone is subject to the law as fully and completely as any other and the Government is no exception.
It is indeed the pride of constitutional democracy and rule of law that the Government stands on the same footing as a private individual so far as the obligation of the law is concerned the former is equally bound as the latter.
(emphasis added)The Apex Court further held thusBut it is necessary to point out that since the doctrine of promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine, it must yield when the equity so requires.
If it can be shown by the Government that having regard to the facts as they have transpired, it would be inequitable to hold the Government to the promise made by it, the Court would not raise an equity in favour of the promisee and enforce the promise against the Government.
The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because, on the facts, equity would not require that the Government should be held bound by the promise made by it.
When the Government is able to show that in view of the facts as have transpired since the making of the promise, public interest would be prejudiced if the Government were required to carry out the promise, the Court would have to balance the public interest in the Government carrying out a promise made to a citizen which has induced the citizen to act upon it and alter his position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promise were required to be carried out by the Government and determine which way the equity lies.
It would not be enough for the Government just to say that public interest requires that the Government should not be compelled to carry out the promise or that the public interest would suffer if the Government were required to honour it.
The Government cannot, as Shah, J., pointed out in the IndoAfghan Agencies case, claim to be exempt from the liability to carry out the promise on some indefinite and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency, nor can the Government claim to be the sole Judge of its liability and repudiate it on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances.
If the Government wants to resist the liability, it will have to disclose to the Court what are the facts and circumstances on account of which the Government claims to be exempt from the liability and it would be for the Court to decide whether those facts and circumstances are such as to render it inequitable to enforce the liability against the Government.
Mere claim of change of policy would not be sufficient to exonerate the Government from the liability the Government would have to show what precisely is the changed policy and also its reason and justification so that the Court can judge for itself which way the public interest lies and what the equity of the case demands.
It is only if the Court is satisfied, on proper and adequate material placed by the Government, that overriding public interest requires that the Government should not be held bound by the promise but should be free to act unfettered by it, that the Court would refuse to enforce the promise against the Government.
The Court would not act on the mere ipse dixit of the Government, for it is the Court which has to decide and not the Government whether the Government should be held exempt from liability.
This is the essence of the rule of law.
The burden would be upon the Government to show that the public interest in the Government acting otherwise than in accordance with the promise is so overwhelming that it would be inequitable to hold the Government bound by the promise and the Court would insist on a highly rigorous standard of proof in the discharge of this burden.
But even where there is no such overriding public interest, it may still be competent to the Government to resile from the promise on giving reasonable notice, which need not be a formal notice, giving the promisee a reasonable opportunity of resuming his position provided of course it is possible for the promisee to restore status quo ante.
If, however, the promisee cannot resume his position, the promise would become final and irrevocable.
Vide Emmanuel Avodeji Ajaye v. Briscoe35.In the case of State of Punjab v. Nestle India Ltd ((2004) 6 SCC 465 ), the Apex Court in paragraphs 43 onwards considered a conflicting decision and reaffirmed its earlier decision in the case of Motilal (supra) and held thus43.
It would appear that these observations are in conflict with the earlier and subsequent pronouncements of the law on promissory estoppel.
Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J. had held that the representation was enforceable despite the accident that the grant was invalid inasmuch as it was contrary to statute.
Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills3 had said that the promise was enforceable against the Government despite the requirement of Article 299 of the Constitution.
Similarly, Century Spg.4 held that despite the requirement of the statute prescribing the manner and form to grant exemption from payment of octroi, a promise not made in that manner or form could be enforced in equity.
Then again in Godfrey Philips6 the Court directed an exemption to be granted on the basis of the principles of promissory estoppel even though Rule 8 of the Central Excise Rules, 1944 required exemption to be granted by notification.44.
Of course, the Government cannot rely on a representation made without complying with the procedure prescribed by the relevant statute, but a citizen may and can compel the Government to do so if the factors necessary for founding a plea of promissory estoppel are established.
Such a proposition would not fall foul of our constitutional scheme and public interest.
On the other hand, as was observed in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills case3 and approved in the subsequent decisions (SCC p. 442, para 24)It is indeed the pride of constitutional democracy and rule of law that the Government stands on the same footing as a private individual so far as the obligation of the law is concerned the former is equally bound as the latter.
It is indeed difficult to see on what principle can a Government, committed to the rule of law, claim immunity from the doctrine of promissory estoppel.45.
None of these decisions has been considered in I.T.C. Bhadrachalam Paperboards v. Mandal Revenue Officer, A.P.17 except for a brief reference to Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J.s judgment which was explained away as not being an authority for the proposition that even where the Government has to and can act only under and in accordance with a statute  an act done by the Government in violation thereof can be treated as a presentation to found a plea of promissory estoppel.
But that is exactly what the learned Judge had said.
In the case of Kasinka Trading v. Union of India, ((1995) 1 SCC 27)4, the Apex Court held thuds 12.
It has been settled by this Court that the doctrine of promissory estoppel is applicable against the Government also particularly where it is necessary to prevent fraud or manifest injustice.
The doctrine, however, cannot be pressed into aid to compel the Government or the public authority to carry out a representation or promise which is contrary to law or which was outside the authority or power of the officer of the Government or of the public authority to make.
There is preponderance of judicial opinion that to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel clear, sound and positive foundation must be laid in the petition itself by the party invoking the doctrine and that bald expressions, without any supporting material, to the effect that the doctrine is attracted because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position relying on the assurance of the Government would not be sufficient to press into aid the doctrine.
In our opinion, the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked in the abstract and the courts are bound to consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public good at large, because while considering the applicability of the doctrine, the courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present to the mind of the court, while considering the applicability of the doctrine.
The doctrine must yield when the equity so demands if it can be shown having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case that it would be inequitable to hold the Government or the public authority to its promise, assurance or representation.
(emphasis added)We have already held for the reasons recorded that the decision of the Government of Goa of the withdrawal of its Special Economic Zones policy is legal and valid.
The said decision is guided by considerations of larger public interest.
The State Government found that setting up of Special Economic Zones will not be in larger public interest.
Various aspects including its effect on resources of the State and possibility of large scale migrations have been considered by the State Government.
Therefore, in the present case, considering the decision of the Government of Goa of withdrawal of SEZ policy which is based on consideration of public interest, it will be inequitable to hold the State Government or the GIDC to be bound by its alleged promise and representation.
Though the allotments made to the companies is illegal, their Applications can be considered afresh by the GIDC for allotment of the same lands for any lawful purpose except for setting up of special economic zones.
If fresh allotment cannot be made, the GIDC will have to refund the amounts received towards deposit, lease premium, interest and rent as per notice dated 13th June 2008 at the time of the companies handing over the possession of lands.
CONSIDERATION OF QUESTION h96.
Now, the issue which remains to be considered is as regards the alleged delay and latches on the part of the Petitioners in filing the Public Interest Litigation Petitions.
The Public Interest Litigation Petitions have been filed in April 2008 and therefore, it was contended that there is a gross delay in challenging the allotments made in the year 2006.
It was contended by the Companies that merely because certain representations were made earlier, the delay cannot be justified.
The basic argument is that as a result of delay, the Companies have changed their positions by taking several steps on the basis of allotments made by the GIDC.
Perusal of the record of the Writ Petition No.316 of 2008 shows that on 16th June, 2005, a Communidade of Verna had written a letter to the Minister of Industries in which a reference to the newspaper report is made that the State Government was planning to acquire area for setting up SEZs in Verna Industrial Estate.
An objection was raised to the said proposal by the Communidade to which a reply was received on 20th July, 2005 from the Under Secretary of Industries Minister on which the State Government has not taken any decision for setting up SEZ in Verna Industrial Estate.
Reliance has been placed on the views expressed by the local villagers that the proposed SEZ in Verna by the State Government on the land belonging to Verna Communidade should be dropped immediately.
There were resolutions passed by villagers on 22nd July, 2007 recording strong protest for allotting 1,91,200 sq. meters of land acquired for industrial purposes for SEZ project.
Nothing is brought on record to show that any publicity was given by the State Government or by the GIDC to the allotment of lands for SEZ project.
Therefore, applications were made under the Right to Information Act, 2005 for obtaining information.
The details of the applications have been placed on record of Writ Petition No.316 of 2008 on page 1429.
Total 9 applications were made under the said Act from 11th April 2007 onwards till 8th April 2008.
The information was lastly provided in March 2008 before the filing of the petitions.97.
Reliance is placed on a complaint dated 19th October, 2007 filed by the Peoples Movement against the SEZ making allegations of corruption as regards allotment of lands to the said Companies for SEZ.
There is a reply dated 10th December, 2007 issued by the Directorate of Vigilance, Anti Corruption Bureau of Government of Goa stating that the matter was under consideration of the State Government.
It will be necessary to make a reference to Memorandum dated 20th October, 2007 sent by the Peoples Movement against the SEZ to the Chief Minister requesting for withdrawal of SEZ policy.
There is another representation made by citizens on 3rd March, 2008 to the Chief Minister complaining of the effect of setting up SEZs in the State .
It must be stated that in case of three SEZs which were notified, the notification was issued on 6th November, 2007.
As pointed out in the earlier part of the judgment, till the notification was published, the developers were not entitled to commence any work for authorized operations.
Moreover, nothing is brought on record to show that that on the basis of the notification, approval to the units under Section 15 of the SEZ Act was granted.
It must be stated that within two months i.e. on 11th January, 2008, a communication was received by a companies to stop further work on the allotted lands.
In Writ Petition no.263 of 2008, in paragraph Nos.56 and 57 the Petitioners have explained as to why they could not approach the Court till 2nd April 2008.It is stated that a sum of Rs.20,000/ was demanded only for grant of copies of lease deeds.
The petitioners have set out the manner in which they could get copies of the relevant documents only in December 2007.
There is sufficient explanation for the delay.98.
By carrying out amendment to the Writ Petitions Nos.310,314 and 316 of 2008, a challenge was also made to the grant of approvals and notifications under the SEZ Act.
The Writ Petitions were filed in April, 2008 and therefore, it cannot be said that due to the alleged delay and latches on the part of the Petitioners in PIL Writ Petitions, the companies have materially changed their position.
The Petitioners in the said three petitions filed the Petitions after securing copies of relevant documents by making applications under the Right to information Act.
Therefore, there is no undue delay in filing these petitions.
Considering the averments in the Petitions and material on record, the Petitioners have approached the Court expeditiously.
OTHER ISSUES99.
In the Writ Petitions filed by the companies, it was contended that though the GIDC issued show cause notices, no purpose will be served by directing the GIDC to consider the reply given by the Petitioners and decide the show cause notices inasmuch as direction under Section 16 of the GIDC Act has been issued by the State Government under which the GIDC will have no choice but to cancel the allotments.
However, we need not go into this aspect as we have found the orders of allotment of lands made by the GIDC to be arbitrary and illegal.
Therefore, we are not going into the legality and validity of the direction under However, this will not preclude the GIDC from reconsidering the applications for allotment made by the companies in accordance with law.100.
In those cases, where approvals were granted under the SEZ Act but the SEZs were not notified, the show cause notices have been issued by the Central Government.
We have already held that the Central Government has power to withdraw the approvals.
It is for the concerned Companies to give reply to the show cause notices.
The show cause notices will have to be decided by taking into consideration the fact that the allotment of lands by the GIDC is held to be illegal.
In those cases where approvals are not granted under the SEZ Act, it is obvious that the applications proposals cannot be processed further as the Government of Goa has withdrawn the recommendation.
Therefore, no fault can be found with the decision of the Central Government holding that such proposals shall be treated as dropped in as much as the recommendation of the State Government is necessary for grant of approval.
As far as three notified SEZs are concerned, the stand of the Central Government is that the Government of Goa should negotiate with the developers.
The notifications have been issued on the basis of the allotment of lands by the GIDC.
As the allotments of lands are held to be illegal, notifications cannot be acted upon now.
In the petitions filed by the companies, there is a challenge to the direction issued by the Government of Goa to the GIDC to revoke the leases.
There is also a challenge to the show cause notices issued by the GIDC on the basis of the said direction.
As we have held that the allotments made to the said companies is illegal, it is not necessary to deal with the said challenges.
In view of the finding recorded by us that the allotment of lands made to the companies is illegal, the possession of the lands will have to be restored to the GIDC.
The original owners of the lands have not challenged the acquisition of the said lands.
Hence, the player made in the Public Interest Writ Petitions for return of the lands to the original owners cannot be granted.
As we have held that the applications for allotment of lands made by the said companies can be considered afresh in accordance with law, we are directing that the parties shall maintain status quo as of today in respect of the said lands for a period of 4 months from today.
If the said companies are interested in fresh consideration of their applications for allotment, they are entitled to apply to the GIDC in that behalf.
In such event, the applications of the companies shall be considered afresh by the GIDC in accordance with law notwithstanding the direction issued to maintain status quo as of today in respect of the said lands.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS101.
The main findings recorded by us can be summarized as under(i)
On the basis of the consideration of the provisions of SEZ Act and the SEZ Rules, we hold that before the Board of Approval approves the proposal and before the Letter of Approval is issued by the Central Government, the State Government can always withdraw its recommendation in case the proposal is initiated under Subsection (2) of Section 3 of the SEZ Act.
In such a case, Approval cannot be granted on the basis of the recommendation which is withdrawn.
Even after a Letter of Approval is issued, but before the notification under section 4(1) is issued, the Board of approval and or the Central Government has a power to withdraw the approval on the basis of withdrawal of the recommendations by the State Government.
However, the approval can be cancelled withdrawn in such a case only after following the principles of natural justice.
The fact that several steps have been taken by the developers on the basis of approval will certainly be a relevant consideration which will have to be taken into account by the board.(ii) Whether the Central Government can denotify a notified SEZ without the consent of the developer is a question which need not be decided in the present Petitions inasmuch as the action of the Central Government of declining to denotify the SEZ in three cases has not been specifically challenged before us in any of the Petitions.(iii)
It is not possible to hold that the said policy decision of withdrawing the earlier SEZ policy is either arbitrary or illegal.
The decision is legal which based on consideration of public interest.(iv)There was no direction issued by the State Government in exercise of powers under Section 16 of the GIDC Act to allot any land for the purposes of setting up SEZs.(v)
The power under Clause (a) of Section 14 of the transfer of lands vesting in GIDC can be exercised only with a view to ensure establishment, growth and development of industries.
Therefore, the exercise of power under Section 14 for grant of land for setting up SEZs will depend on the factual situation such as the purpose for which it is going to be used by the SEZ.
If the land is to be allotted or transferred to SEZ predominantly for promoting or establishing or developing industries, then the power to allot can be lawfully exercised.(vi)
The allotment of lands to the companies has been made in undue haste without proper scrutiny of their applications.
The allotment of lands has been made arbitrarily.
Procedure adopted in the allotment is not fair and transparent.
The allotments made by the GIDC do not stand the test of reasonableness.(vii)
In the present case, considering the decision of the Government of Goa of withdrawal of SEZ policy which based on consideration of public interest, it will be inequitable to hold the State Government or the GIDC to be bound by its alleged promise and representation.(viii)
The Writ Petitions filed in public interest are no liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and latches.102.
In Misc Civil Application no.391 of 2009 in W.P. No.263 of 2008, a direction is sought for initiating action against an Advocate.
The prayer made in the application is beyond the scope of the petition.
Therefore, the Applicants will have to adopt appropriate remedy.102A. As one of us (A.S.Oka, J.) is not sitting at Panaji, this Judgment is being pronounced by the other member of the Bench (Reis, J.) in accordance with Rule 1 of Chapter XI of the Appellate Side Rules.103.
In the circumstances, we pass the following order(i)
The allotment of lands made By the GIDC to the said companies (the Petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.349 of 2008, 380 of 2008, 436 of 2008, 437 of 2008, 438 of 2008 and 501 of 2008 and 507 of 2008) is illegal.
The allotments as well as the Lease Deeds executed on the basis of the orders of allotment are quashed and set aside.(ii)
Accordingly, rule issued in Writ Petition nos.310 of 2008, 314 of 2008 and 316 of 2008 is made absolute in terms of prayers (a) thereof.(iii)
In case of the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.501 of 2008, 437 of 2008 and 438 of 2008, the show cause notices issued for cancellation withdrawal of the approvals granted under the SEZ Act shall be decided in accordance with law.
The said Petitioners shall be given an opportunity to file reply or additional reply to the show cause notices and shall be given an opportunity of being heard.
Subject to the finding recorded that there is a power vesting in the authorities to cancel or to withdraw the approval, all questions on merits of the show cause notices are kept open.(iv)
It will be open for the Petitioners in Writ Petition Nos.349 of 2008, 380 of 2008, 436 of 2008, 437 of 2008, 438 of 2008, 501 of 2008 and 507 of 2008 to apply to the GIDC for fresh consideration of their earlier Applications for allotment of lands.
If the Petitioners apply within six weeks from today, the said Applications shall be considered afresh by the GIDC in the light of the observations made in this Judgment.(v) The Petitioners in the aforesaid Writ Petitions as well as the GIDC shall maintain status quo as of today in respect of the Lands for a period of four months from today.
The order of status quo is clarified to mean that the said Petitioners shall not carry on any further construction on the said lands and shall not hereafter create any third party rights in respect of the said lands for a period of four months.
The GIDC shall not dispossess the Petitioners for a period of four months, and shall not make allotment of the said lands to any third parties during the said period.
If within a period of four months from today, fresh allotment is not made by the GIDC, on expiry of said period of four months, it will be open for the GIDC to take steps in accordance with law for taking over possession of the lands.(v)
The Miscellaneous Civil Application Number 391 of 2009 is disposed of by keeping open the remedy of the Applicants.(vi) The Writ Petition Nos.310 of 2008,314 of 2008 and 316 of 2008 are partly allowed in the above terms with no orders as to costs.
(vii)
In view of the order in the said three Petition, the Writ Petition No.263 of 2008 is disposed of without granting any separate relief with no orders as to costs.(viii)
Subject to what is observed in this judgment, Writ Petition Nos.349 of 2008, 380 of 2008, 436 of 2008, 437 of 2008, 438 of 2008 and 501 of 2008 and 507 of 2008 are dismissed with no order as to costs.
