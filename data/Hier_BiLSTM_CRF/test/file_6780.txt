It is further stated that the said transactions are duly accounted and it is an out and out assignment sale and there is no semblance of sub leasing.8.
Based on these submissions, the petitioner has challenged the demand towards subletting charges and penalty towards alleged subletting raised in the impugned communications.9.
Petitioners contention in summary is that levy of subleasing charges and penalty is not supported by authority of law, and is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.10.
In support of the contentions, learned Advocate for the petitioner has placed reliance on the following Judgments.(1) 1971 (3) SCC 883 , General Manager, North East Frontier Railway and others Vs.
Dinabandhu Chakraborty.(2) (1987) 2 SCC 160 , State of Karnataka Vs.
Shree Rameshwara Rice Mills.(3) (2009) 2 SCC 337 , BSNL Vs. Motorola.(4) (1990) 4 SCC 113 ,
Dabur India Ltd.
Vs.
State of Uttar Pradesh others.(5) (2008)7 SCC 722 , Nirmal Kanta Vs.
Ashok Kumar and another.(6) AIR 1985 Bombay 429, Virji Nathuram and others Vs. Krishnakumar.(7) (2007)1 SCC 732 , Arun Kumar and others Vs. Union of India and others.11.
The petition is opposed on the ground that(a) With an object of curbing the tendency of unauthorised subletting, the MIDC has taken a policy decision to levy subletting charges and penalty.(b)
This decision is circulated by MIDCs circular dated 1532007.(c)
The commissioning of the factory of the purchaser which is admittedly done on 15082007, and due to this fact entry of M s. Purohit company is liable to be treated as sublease.(d)
The demand is just and reasonable.12.
In the affidavit in reply filed by the respondents, the fact of the matter that the amount of consideration received by the petitioner being towards sale assignment of lease is not disputed.
All that is asserted by the respondents is that, the delivery of advance possession before the sale attracts subletting charges and penalty.13.
This Court has perused the record, and the precedents cited at bar.14.
This Court has to address the limited issues involved in this petition which are framed as below(a) Was M s Purohit and Company introduced by the petitioner as a prospective purchaser or as sub lessee(b) Does delivery of possession for raising factory building to M s Purohit Company attract subletting charges and penalty irrespective of nature of transaction15.
Neither the petitioner nor Purohit Company have ever pleaded that it was a lessee.
It is also seen that it is not the case of the respondents that any agreement or covenants disclose any payment done or agreed even as an alternate stipulation, any liability to pay rent.16.
Admittedly, the petitioner and the purchaser had moved the respondents for transfer of lease hold rights, and in response, the respondents have come with four distinct demands.
Two amongst those demands are towards transfer charges and rent for land which demands are not indisputed.
Remaining two demands pertain to subletting charges and penalty for alleged subletting.17.
It is seen, and is conclusive from pleadings and record produced by the petitioner that based on oral agreement, M s Purohit Company has paid to the petitioner various amounts towards consideration of assignment by cheques and Demand Drafts.
Even the respondents do not plead that any amount is shown to have been paid as rent.18.
Going by preponderance of probabilities no entrepreneur would part with such large sum of around Rs.1 crore if such a convenient plot could be available on rent or sub lease, that too for permanent construction and use for a spinning mill.19.
The respondent is a statutory Corporation constituted under the Maharashtra Industrial Development Act 1961.
Powers, duties and functions of this corporation are derived from said Act and Rules made thereunder.20.
We have perused the circular relied upon by the respondents as authority for levying of said penalty i.e. circular dated 1532007.
It is seen that this circular is issued by the Chief Executive Officer of respondents.
It does not disclose or demonstrate existence of any authority of law.
Any authority of law for impugned act is demonstrated during the course of the submissions.
It is seen that the said circular is in the form of internal communication by the Chief Executive Officer, and does not have force of law or rules having force of law.
By any permutation and combination, this circular cannot be treated as issued under the authority of law.21.
It is not shown before us that any provision of the Act or the Rule made thereunder empowers the respondents to levy charges towards sub letting of and or penalty for such unauthorized subletting, or treating any transfer of possession to be demand to be subletting.
The respondents have not shown any rule of law which would authorize the respondent corporation to raise a presumption that any other party in possession than the original or subsequent allottee, would be deemed to be sub lessee and that the respondents would be entitled to levy subletting charges, and penalty for any unauthorised subletting.22.
It is well settled that any public body or statutory authority cannot charge any fee or penalty without authority of law.23.
The result that ensues is that neither on facts or even by fiction of law the transaction between the petitioner and the purchaser can be regarded as sublease.
The transaction is a case of and out and out sale assignment of lease hold rights.
This conclusion is the only fall out from the undisputed and indisputable facts.24.
In the result, the Points framed by this Court in para foregoing 14 are answered as follows (a) As to Point (a) M s Purohit Company was not introduced as a sub lessee.(b)
As to Point (b)  
The respondents do not have authority of law to levy any subletting charges on the petitioner in view of the facts of the case.
The transfer of possession in favour of Purohit Company does not attract subletting charges and penalty towards alleged subletting.25.
Considering the limited issue involved in the matter, it is not necessary to discuss the citations relied upon by the petitioner.26.
In the result, the petition succeeds.
Rule is made absolute in terms of prayer clause (1) and (1A)In the circumstances, parties are directed to bear own costs.
