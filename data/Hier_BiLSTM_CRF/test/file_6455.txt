However, such conditions were modified on 19.5.2017 to clarify that the Office Memorandum dated 28.3.2017 is applicable equally to all retired Central Government employees belonging to the State of Jammu Kashmir who are holding General Pool residential accommodation in Delhi, irrespective of whether they were litigants before the Delhi High Court.
6.
Mr. Bimal Roy Jad, learned senior counsel appeared for the applicants in M.A. Nos. 1556 of 2021 and 1573 of 2021 and vehemently argued that this Court on 5.8.2021 held that the directions issued in J.L. Koul were under Article 142 of the Constitution of India but in fact, the directions were not issued under Article 142 of the Constitution of India but while deciding the rights of the Kashmiri Migrants to residential accommodation.
It was further argued that the Kashmiri Migrants form a different class as victims of terrorism, therefore, the same were dealt with while keeping in view peculiar hardships faced by them.
Since, neither the transit accommodation is available for them nor they can go to their houses which stand either occupied by the local population or destroyed, therefore, the Kashmiri Migrants have been treated as a class apart, particularly the applicants who were working in the critical intelligence offices.
Thus, in light of such background, the Scheme was framed.
7.
It was argued that 31 Kashmiri Migrants were given protection in J.L. Koul, therefore, similar protection was accorded by the High Court of Delhi to the 54 Kashmiri Migrants.
As per written submissions filed by the appellants, 80 Kashmiri Migrants are in possession of Government accommodation in Delhi and 3 in Faridabad.
8.
To a question put to Mr. Jad, it was admitted by him that some of the migrants have retired many years ago but some might have retired in 2016, 2017 and 2018 as well.
Learned counsel argued that since the Scheme provides a humanitarian approach to the problems faced by the Kashmiri Migrants, therefore, the order passed by this Court needs to be recalled.
It was argued that the judgments referred to by this Court such as Lok Prahari, S.D. Bandi and Shiv Sagar Tiwari arise in different circumstances and are not applicable to the displaced Kashmiri Migrants.
9.
Mr. Jad submitted that 31 retirees are still in occupation of Government accommodation, therefore, the same benefit should be granted to the other occupants in Delhi and or National Capital Region.
It was also submitted that the judgments referred to by this Court in Lok Prahari were in respect of prominent public figures such as Chief Ministers, therefore, such directions in the aforesaid referred cases would not be applicable to the present applicants who are victims of terrorism.
10.
On the other hand, Ms. Madhavi Divan, learned Additional Solicitor General of India pointed out that the Government has given various benefits to Kashmiri Migrants including grant of financial assistance, financial package for repairs and renovation of the houses, jobs, ration etc.
It was also argued that with the abrogation of Article 370 from the Constitution of India, the Kashmiri Migrants have started moving back to the Kashmir Valley.
Reference was made to the statement of Honble Minister of State in the Ministry of Home Affairs on the floor of the House on 17 th March 2021 that nearly 3800 persons have returned back to the Kashmir Valley in the last few years to take up the PM package jobs.
520 migrants have returned to Kashmir for taking up the jobs that have been provided to them under the Rehabilitation Package post abrogation of Article 370.
Another nearly 2000 migrants are also likely to return under the same policy in the year 2021 on successful completion of the selection process.
The Parliament was also informed that Government has devised policies for Return and Rehabilitation of Kashmiri Migrants under the Prime Ministers Packages in the year 2008 and 2015.
The various components of the policies included assistance at the rate of Rs. 7.5 lacs for repairing fully or partially damaged house Rs. 2 lacs for dilapidated unused house and Rs. 7.5 lacs for purchase construction of a house in group housing societies for those who sold their properties during the period after 1989 and before the enactment of JK Migrant Immovable Property Preservation, Protection and Restraint of Distress Sale 1997.
Cash relief is also being provided which has been raised to Rs. 13,000/ per family at the rate of Rs. 3250/ per person.
6,000 posts were announced under PM Packages and nearly 3,800 Kashmiri Migrants have been rehabilitated directly by providing government employment.
In respect of transit accommodation, it was stated as under In order to provide accommodation to the 6,000 Kashmiri Migrants who are getting employed in the Government of Jammu and Kashmir in the valley, 6,000 Transit Accommodation units are being constructed for Kashmiri Migrants Employees in various districts of Kashmir Valley at an estimated cost of Rs.920 Cr.
So far, 1,025 dwelling units have already been constructed which include 721 dwelling units in the district of Budgam, Kulgam, Kupwara, Anantnag and Pulwama.
Another 1,488 units are under construction and land has been identified for about 2444 units.
11.
We do not find that any modification is required to the order dated 5.8.2021.
In J.L. Koul, an affidavit of Chief Secretary of the State was filed disclosing that out of 54 appellant Migrants, 23 had already vacated Government accommodation whereas 31 Migrants were still occupying the Government accommodation.
The appellants were allotted residential accommodation at Jammu in the year 19891990 being Government servants.
The writ petitions were filed before the High Court in the year 1995 which were decided by the learned Single Bench.
Aggrieved against the directions issued by the learned Single Bench of the High Court, the occupants filed intracourt appeal before the High Court which was dismissed.
Still further, appeal was filed before this Court.
12.
This Court noticed that during the period of 12 years when the matter remained pending, directions were issued to prepare a Rehabilitation Scheme which was ultimately prepared and placed on record by the Chief Secretary of the State.
Accepting the Scheme, it was held that no further action direction was required.
However, the appeal was disposed of with a pious hope that the State shall take all endeavours to rehabilitate the persons who have been victim of terrorism and till the State is able to rehabilitate and provide the appropriate accommodation to 31 appellant retirees oustees, they shall continue to possess the accommodations which are in their respective possession on this date.
13.
We do not find any merit in the argument that directions in J.L. Koul were not under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
This Court accepted the Rehabilitation Scheme produced on affidavit by the Chief Secretary of the State and thereafter expressed a pious hope.
This Court did not decide any question of law or fact but merely expressed a compassionate view to alleviate the difficulties being faced by Kashmiri Migrants.
The Rehabilitation Package approved by this Court itself contemplated that transit accommodations were being constructed at three sites but if such transit accommodation was not available, Rupees One Lakh per family towards rental and incidental expenses would be given to those who may not be accommodated in transit accommodation.
Thus, even if they have not been given alternate accommodation, the Scheme approved by this Court contemplates cash compensation towards rental and incidental expenses.
The compassion could not be extended in perpetuity and has to end some day or the other.
Therefore, seeking parity with 31 retirees who were granted benefit in J.L. Koul is not tenable.
The applicants are occupying the government accommodation at the cost of other Government servants who are waiting in queue for allotment of a government accommodation to discharge their official duties.
The compassion shown to Kashmiri Migrants has to be balanced with the expectations of the serving officers to discharge their duties effectively.
The Government accommodation is meant for serving officers and cannot be taken as a recourse to stay in Government accommodation for the life time of the Government servants or his her spouse.
14.
The Office Memorandum issued on 28.3.2017 was in terms of the directions of the High Court of Delhi.
Such order of High Court has not been approved by this Court vide order dated 5.8.2021.
Therefore, the entire basis of issuance of Office Memorandum falls flat as the very foundation of such Scheme stands knocked down.
15.
We find that the Office Memorandum allowing government accommodation to the retired Government employees who are Kashmiri Migrants cannot meet the touchstone of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
The Government houses flats are meant for serving Government employees.
Post retirement, the government employees including Kashmiri Migrants are granted pensionary benefits including monthly pension.
The classification made in favour of Government employees who were Kashmiri Migrants stands on the same footing as that of other Government employees or public figures.
There cannot be any justification on the basis of social or economic criteria to allow the Kashmiri Migrants to stay in Government accommodation for indefinite long period.
16.
To say that they would return to the Valley when the situation will improve is an openended statement capable of being interpreted in different ways.
The satisfaction of improvement of situation would be widely different by the erstwhile Government employees and the State.
But in no case it can be countenanced that the former Government employee, may be a Kashmiri Migrant, is entitled to stay in a government accommodation for an indefinite period.
Thus, we are unable to uphold the Office Memorandum and strike it down as being totally arbitrary and discriminatory.
17.
In Para 2(ii) of the Scheme, Kashmiri Pandits were to be accommodated in Delhi for first five years starting from the date of their retirement and thereafter be shifted to National Capital Region.
Thus, we find it reasonable if Kashmiri Migrants are allowed government accommodation for a period of three years from the date of retirement so as to make alternative arrangements within such period.
If an alternative accommodation is not available for them at their instance, they are at liberty to move to the transit accommodation or to avail cash amount in lieu of transit accommodation.
Thus, a government employee who is a Kashmiri Migrant would not be entitled to retain Government accommodation for a period exceeding three years, may be in Delhi or in the National Capital Region or for that matter anywhere in the country.
18.
The threeyears period can also be considered as cooling off period for the officers who were in active intelligence work so that they can resume normal life but the excuse of once working for intelligence agency is not a valid ground to occupy the Government accommodation for indefinite period.
19.
In view thereof, we do not find any merit in the present applications.
The same are dismissed.
However, time granted to Omkar Nath Dhar, since deceased, to vacate the premises is extended upto 30.11.2021.
The action taken report by the Union shall be filed on or before 15.12.2021.
The liberty is given to the Union to file an application for modification of the order in respect of the 31 retirees as well who are covered by the judgment in J.L. Koul.
