The appellant was directed to submit Consent from the Telangana State Pollution Control Board and also Environmental Clearance (hereinafter referred to as EC) from the Ministry of Environment Forest (hereinafter referred to as the MoEF) as per the Environment Impact Assessment Notification (hereinafter referred to as the EIA Notification 2006) dated 14th September 2006 and 15th January 2016.
It was also stated in the said communication that if the appellant fails to submit the Approved Mining Plan within the stipulated period, it will be presumed that the appellant was not interested in getting the Quarry Lease for the said area and further course of action will be initiated in accordance with law.
Thereafter, the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, Telangana (hereinafter referred to as the SEIAA) examined the said proposal in accordance with EIA Notification 2006 and the subsequent amendments thereof and exempted the same from the process of public hearing as the mining lease area was less than 25 hectares.
The SEIAA accorded EC on 11th April 2017, with specific and general conditions.
4. Challenging the same, the respondent Nos. 1 to 3 filed an appeal under Section 16 read with Section 18(1) and Section 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act) before the National Green Tribunal, Southern Zone, Chennai being Appeal No. 582 of 2017 (SZ), which was transferred to National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal) being Appeal No. 24 of 2018, wherein a twofold challenge was made by the respondent Nos. 1 to 3 first, that the area was reduced from 29 hectares to 24 hectares only in order to avoid the rigours of public hearing and second, that the Singotham Lake was in close proximity of the proposed mining area and as such, the EC granted, was not correct in law.
5.
In the said proceedings, the learned Tribunal had passed an interim order on 24th April 2018, thereby staying the order challenged in the appeal.

Mr. Viswanathan, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the learned Tribunal has grossly erred in coming to the conclusion that the area was reduced by the appellant from 29 hectares to 24 hectares only in order to avoid the rigours of public hearing.
He submitted that the appellant had no role to play in such a reduction.
As a matter of fact, the appellant had applied for an area admeasuring 29 hectares.
It was only the authorities which had reduced the area.
He further submitted that the ground with regard to Singotham Lake being in the close proximity to the proposed mining area, is also totally erroneous.
The learned Senior Counsel, relying on the Google Maps as well as photographs, would submit that the distance between the proposed mining area and the Singotham Lake is 0.25 km.
It is therefore submitted that the said distance is in accordance with the requirements of law.

18.
Thereafter, vide order dated 22nd April 2017, the Government of Telangana granted Quarry Lease for Quartz over an extent of 24.00 hectares in Sy.
No.
330/1 of Kalwakole Village, Peddakothapally Mandal, Nagarkurnool (erstwhile Mahabubnagar) District in favour of the appellant.
19.
A perusal of the aforesaid documents would reveal that the appellant, in fact, had applied for grant of Mining Lease for 29 hectares.
It is, however, the authorities including the Tahsildar, the RDO, Assistant Director of Mining and Geology, Mahabubnagar, who had recommended grant of Quarry Lease over 24 hectares.
Insofar as the water body is concerned, the appellant, in his application as well as Mining Plan, has clearly mentioned that Singotham Lake is situated at a distance of 0.25 km.
While processing the proposal of the appellant, the Tahsildar and the Assistant Revenue Inspector of the concerned area have physically carried out the inspection.
Not only that, the Assistant Director of Mines and Geology had personally inspected the area on 11th August 2016, and the Surveyor had surveyed the applied area with the help of a GPS instrument.
It is also revealed from the record that the area of 24 hectares in Sy.
No.
330/1, which consists a larger area, was earmarked after leaving the safety distance of 0.25 km from Singotham Lake.
In its report, the Surveyor had also reported that the demarcated area was not overlapping with the existing leases and there were no pending applications in that area.
20.
It could thus be seen that prior to grant of inprinciple approval by the Director of Mines and Geology, Hyderabad, Government of Telangana, the proposed area was physically inspected by the Tahsildar along with the Assistant Revenue Inspector.
The Assistant Director of Mines and Geology, Mahabubnagar had independently inspected the area.
The area was surveyed by the Official Surveyor with the GPS instrument and while earmarking the area, the distance of 0.25 km was also maintained.
21.
After inprinciple approval was granted, the appellant submitted its Mining Plan on 20th October 2016.
The proposal of the appellant was thereafter considered by the SEAC on 30th December 2016, wherein it was resolved to recommend the proposal of the appellant for grant of EC.
Thereafter, the SEIAA, in its meeting dated 11h April 2017, has granted its EC after considering all the aspects.
Thereafter, Quarry Lease has been granted in favour of the appellant on 22nd April 2017.
22.
It could thus be seen that the proposal of the appellant has undergone scrutiny at various stages.
Only after it was found that it was in conformity with the provisions of law, the inprinciple approval and EC for Quarry Lease had been granted.
Thereafter, the appellant has submitted his Mining Plan which was again duly examined by various authorities.
The proposal of the appellant was initially considered by SEAC and recommended for grant of EC.
Thereafter, SEIAA, after considering all the aspects has granted EC to the project of the appellant.
Only thereafter, the Quarry Lease had been granted in favour of the appellant.
23.
Insofar as the finding of the learned Tribunal that the area was reduced to 24 hectares from 29 hectares only in order to avoid the rigours of public hearing, is totally erroneous.
The appellant had no role to play in the same.
It is the authorities who recommended approval in respect of only 24 hectares.
Insofar as the mandatory distance from the water body is concerned, the authorities upon survey had found that the mandatory distance of 0.25 km is maintained.
24.
In this view of matter, we find that the learned Tribunal has grossly erred in arriving at a finding that the appellant had reduced the area to 24 hectares only in order to avoid the rigours of public hearing and further that there was no distance of 0.25 km between the proposed mining area and the Singotham Lake. 25.
In the result, the appeal succeeds and the impugned judgment and order dated 17th January 2020, passed by the learned Tribunal is quashed and set aside.
No costs.
