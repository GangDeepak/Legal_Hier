27.
We have heard Shri Amitesh Kumar, Shri Shreeyash Uday Lalit and Shri Mayank Manish, learned counsel for the petitioners, Ms. Manisha T. Karia, learned counsel for NCTE, Dr. Manish Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Rajasthan and Shri Kunal Chatterji, learned counsel for West Bengal Board of Primary Education.
28.
It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that though NCTE or its Regional Committees after having satisfied granted recognition to the petitionerscolleges institutions for the Academic Year 20222023, for no reason, the recognition is not granted for the Academic Year 20212022.
It is submitted that the petitioners have fully complied with all the infrastructural requirements of the NCTE and there is no reason as to why recognition should not be granted for the Academic Year 20212022.
29.
Ms. Manisha T. Karia, learned AdvocateonRecord for the NCTE submitted that taking into consideration the time frame as is prescribed by this Court in the case of Maa Vaishno Devi Mahila Mahavidyalaya v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others (2013) 2 SCC 617, the recognition has been granted only from the Academic Year 20222023 and not from the Academic Year 20212022.
Learned counsel for the respondent States also submit that the petitions deserve to be dismissed.
30.
As could be seen from the facts narrated herein above, proposal of the petitioners for grant of recognition for conducting either B.Ed. course or D.El.
Ed. course or for both have been pending for considerable periods.
In some cases, they have been pending as long as for a period of six years.
In some cases, there has been series of litigations.
31.
However, the factor that is common in all the matters is that NCTE or its Regional Committees, after considering all the necessary requirements, have granted recognition for conducting B.Ed. D.El.
Ed. course for Academic Session 2022 2023.
32.
It will be relevant to refer to paragraph 2 of the order dated 19th April, 2021 passed by the NCTE in the lead matter i.e. Writ Petition (Civil) No.518 of 2021, which read thus 2. AND WHEREAS, on scrutiny of the application submitted by the institution, the documents attached therewith the affidavit submitted and the report received from VT and videography, and the certificates received from the affiliating body, the Committee is satisfied that the applicant fulfils the requirements under the provisions of NCTE Act, Rules and relevant Regulations including the Norms and Standards for the said teacher education programme such as instructional facilities, infrastructural facilities, financial resources, etc., for running the programme.
33.
Perusal of the other petitions would reveal that either identical or similar reasons have been given while granting recognition.
It could thus be seen that recognition has been granted by NCTE or its Regional Committees on scrutiny of the applications submitted by the institutions, the documents attached therewith, the affidavits submitted and the reports received from Visiting Teams and videography.
It also mentions that the Committee was satisfied that the applicant(s) fulfills the requirement under the provisions of NCTE Act, rules and relevant Regulations, after considering the certificates issued from the affiliating bodies.
The order also records its satisfaction with regard to Norms and Standards for the teacher education programme such as instructional facilities, infrastructural facilities, financial resources, etc. for running the programme.
34.
After arriving at such a satisfaction, we are of the view that there can be no rational for NCTE or its Regional Committee to deny the recognition from the Academic Year 20212022 and insist on recognition for Academic Session 20222023.
It is not in dispute that the counselling for admission is yet to commence.
Insofar as the timeline prescribed in the judgment of this Court in the case of Maa Vaishno Devi Mahila Mahavidyalaya (supra) is concerned, this Court itself in catena of orders placed on record has modified the timeline fixed therein.
We find that same course needs to be followed in the present matter, particularly, when the delay is not attributable to the petitioners, but, on the contrary to NCTE or its Regional Committees.
35.
We therefore allow the petitions in the following terms (i)
The cutoff date fixed by this Court in Maa Vaishno Devi Mahila Mahavidyalaya (supra) is extended in the facts of these cases (ii) It is held and declared that the petitioners would be entitled to the recognition granted by respective orders passed by NCTE or its Regional Committees from the Academic Session 20212022 instead of Academic Session 20222023.
(iii) The Respondent NCTE and its Regional Committees are directed to issue formal orders notifications in that regard within a period of three days from today.
(iv) The State and other Authorities would consider grant of affiliation and or other requisite permissions within a period of 15 days from today (v) The petitioners would be entitled to admit the students for Academic Session 20212022 as per the sanction granted by NCTE for the Academic Session 20222023.
(vi) The name of the petitionercolleges institutions shall be included in the counselling programme for admissions.
36.
The writ petitions are allowed and disposed of in the above terms.
Consequently, all pending applications shall stand disposed of.
