 S. Gadkari, J.1.
The appellants, original accused nos.1 to 3, have questioned the correctness of the judgment and order dated 31st March 1995 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Bombay in Sessions Case No.264 of 1985 thereby convicting them, firstly under Section 120B simplicitor and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life and secondly under Section 120B read with Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for life by each of the appellants and thirdly under Section 120B read with Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment of one year each.
The Trial Court has ordered that the sentence passed under Section 120B simplicitor and under Section 120B read with Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code shall run concurrently with the substantive sentence awarded under Section 120B read with Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
By the same judgment and order, the Trial Court has acquitted the appellants nos.1 to 3 from the charge under Section 120B read with Section 364 of the Indian Penal Code.
The said judgment and order dated 31st March 1995 is impugned herein.
It is to be noted here that the original accused no.4 namely Sayeed Ahmed Haji Abdul Razak Mistry expired during the pendency of the present appeal and the said fact is recorded by this Court in its order dated 20.3.2009 and 14.2.2011.
In view of the fact that the original accused no.4 Sayeed Ahmed Haji Abdul Razak Mistry is dead, the proceedings against him stood abated.
For the sake of brevity, the appellants named hereinabove will be referred to with their original accused numbers, as they were before the Trial Court.2.
The facts which enumerates from record and are necessary for deciding the present appeal can briefly be stated thus(i) Smt.
Razia Sultana (PW No.1) in the year 1984 was residing with her mother Smt.
Khatunbi (PW3).
She was married and her husband was doing embroidery work.
She had two brothers namely Adil Rashid and Shaha Nawaz.
Adil (deceased) was working as a welder and Shaha Nawaz was working as a carpenter.
Her brother Adil Rashid was working with original accused no.4 Sayeed Ahmed Haji Abdul Razak Mistry.
The original accused no.4 was her distant relative from her maternal side.
Her brother Adil wanted to set up his own business and in fact he started his business with a partner namely Sherekhan at Gilbert Road, Andheri, Mumbai.
As the business of her brother was prospered, the original accused no.4 and his sons i.e. accused nos.1 and 2 developed jealousy.
The original accused no.4 had told Smt.
Razia Sultana to direct Adil Rashid (deceased) that he should not carry out the said business failing which, he will face serious consequences.
Name of the fiance of Adil with whom he was engaged was Ms. Rana Kaushal.
She was residing in the area of Bombay Central.
Adil Rashid used to keep the photograph of Rana Kaushal with him.
On 15.11.1984 at about 11.30 a.m. her brother returned from bank with Rs.900/. Adil gave Rs.750/ to her mother Smt.
Khatunbi (PW3) and kept Rs.150/ for his pocket expenses.
Adil told Razia and Smt.
Khatunbi that he along with the appellants was going to National Park for a picnic.
The accused no.2 was accompanying Adil at that relevant time.
They were going to National Park by a car.
The car was parked outside her house on the road.
It was a chocolate colour Ambassador car.
The accused nos.1 to 3 and Adil (deceased) left the said place at about 11.30 a.m. on 15.11.1984.
Adil did not return till the evening and therefore Smt.
Razia (PW1) and Smt.
Khatunbi (PW3) took his search with the near relative.
They also asked the original accused no.4, however, he expressed ignorance about the same and in turn told Smt.
Khatunbi that not to worry about the same as they had gone for a picnic, they might come late.
As Adil did not return upto 23.11.1984, Smt.
Razia (PW1) lodged a missing report on 23.11.1984 with the Kherwadi police station bearing no.51 of 1984 which is at Exhibit8.(ii)
In the meanwhile, on 16.11.1984 at about 7.45 a.m., Pandu Parade (PW14), a resident of the village Durvesh, TalukaPalghar, DistrictThane saw the dead body of a male person, when he went to attend the natures call.
He thereafter reported the said fact to the police patil of the village.
The police patil in turn informed the said fact to Manor police station within whose jurisdiction the dead body was found.
In pursuance of F.I.R. lodged by police patil Shri Janardhan Bhaskar Patil of Durvesh village, P.S.I. Shri Laxman Deshmukh (PW15) registered a crime bearing CR No.196 of 1984 under Section 302 read with Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code against unknown person.
PW15
Shri Laxman Deshmukh drew inquest panchanama (Exhibit52) and also scene of offence panchanama (Exhibit53).
From the scene of offence he also seized pieces of strings.
He sent the dead body for conducting postmortem examination to the Medical Officer, Primary Health Centre at Masvan, Taluka Palghar, District Thane.
After conducting the postmortem examination, the body of the said unknown person was buried as per Islam religion rites, as the police and the doctor who conducted autopsy formed the opinion that the deceased person was professing Islam religion.
The pieces of strings (Article11 Colly.) were preserved by PW15 for the purpose of investigation.
The clothes which were on the person of the deceased were taken charge by drawing a seizure panchanama (Exhibit 57).
The said clothes were namely a full pantwhite in colour, a full shirt with black and red lines and blood stains (Article2) and underwear white in colour (Article10).(iii) On 18.1.1985, Smt.
Razia Sultana (PW1) registered First Information Report with the Kherwadi Police station, Bandra, Mumbai bearing CR No.33 of 1985 (Exhibit9) thereby expressing suspicion against the appellant nos.1 and 2 being responsible for the disappearance of her brother Adil Rashid.
The investigation of the said crime was handed over to P.S.I.
Shri Abdul Kadar A. Khan (PW19).
The crime was initially registered under Sections 365 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code.
PW19 PSI Shri Khan conducted investigation.
He arrested the accused nos.1 and 2 on 31.1.1985 at Mumbai and accused no.3 on 19.2.1985 at Meerut and brought to Mumbai on 23.2.1985.
The further investigation was thereafter transferred to Police Inspector Shri Bhimrao Khambe (PW21) on 1.3.1985.
PW19 PSI Shri Khan assisted PW21 Shri Bhimrao Khambe in the further investigation.
During the course of investigation, it was revealed that the dead body of Adil Rashid was found within the jurisdiction of Manor Police station and the said police station had registered crime bearing CR.no.196/1984.(iv) That after receipt of necessary reports from various agencies and after completion of investigation, PW21 Shri Bhimrao Khambe submitted chargesheet in the Court of competent jurisdiction under Section 120B read with Sections 364, 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code.
As the offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, the learned Trial Court committed the said case to the Court of Sessions as contemplated under Section 209 of Cr. P.C.
After committal of the said case, the Trial Court framed charge against the accused persons below Exhibit1.
The said charge was read over and explained to the accused persons to which they denied.
The defence of the accused persons was of total denial.
With a view to establish its case, the prosecution examined in all 21 witnesses.
The learned Trial Court after recording the evidence and after hearing the parties to the said case, convicted and sentenced the accused persons by the impugned judgment and order dated 31st March 1995 as stated hereinabove.3. Heard Ms. Prabha Mane the learned Counsel for the appellants and Smt.
V.R. Bhonsale, the learned APP for the RespondentState and with their assistance we have perused the entire record of the present case.4.
The learned Counsel for the appellants submitted that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the theory of last seen together in view of the settled legal position.
That the time when the appellants were last seen with the deceased Adil Rashid and the finding of the dead body of Adil by different police station on the next day is after substantial lapse of time.
That the time gap between the last seen together and finding of the dead body is too large and the prosecution has failed to put forth the cogent evidence that there is nobody else who might be responsible for committing murder of Adil Rashid.
She further submitted that Smt.
Razia Sultana (PW1) while filing the missing report on 23.11.1984 did not give any specific name of any of the accused persons and did not express any suspicion against the appellants.
She further submitted that though PW15 Police Officer Mr. Laxman Deshmukh from Manor Police station was examined by the prosecution, the photograph of the deceased Adil Rashid was not shown to him thereby proving the identity of the deceased Adil beyond reasonable doubt.
She further contended that the evidence adduced by the prosecution is of such weak nature that the entire link of circumstances is not established beyond reasonable doubt and therefore the appellants cannot be held guilty for want of cogent and proper legal evidence.
She therefore urged before us that the present appeal may be allowed and the appellants may be acquitted from all charges framed levelled against them.
Per contra, the learned APP submitted that though the present case is based on circumstantial evidence, the prosecution has proved the motive behind the present crime.
She further submitted that the appellants were last seen together with the deceased Adil and thereafter deceased was not traceable for substantial period.
She further submitted that the appellant nos.1 and 2 have gave extra judicial confession to PW5 Kishor Dadhich.
That the incriminating articles were discovered at the instance of accused nos.2 and 3 which were belonging to the deceased.
She lastly contended that the prosecution has successfully proved the chain of circumstances.
She therefore prayed that the conviction and sentence of the appellants may be upheld and the present appeal may be dismissed.5.
With a view to appreciate the submissions advanced by the learned Counsel for the appellants and the learned APP for the State, it is necessary to advert in brief, the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.6.

That Sayeed Ahmed Haji Abdul Razak Mistry was her distant relative from her mothers side.
The accused nos.1 and 2 are the sons of accused no.4.
That Adil Rashid wanted to set up his own business.
Adil started his business with a partner namely Shere Khan at Gilber Road, Andheri, Mumbai.
That the business of her brother Adil was prospered in due course of time and therefore the original accused no.4 and his sons i.e. accused nos.1 and 2 developed jealousy.
The original accused no.4 threatened Adil for the same and administered threats of dire consequences.
PW1 thereafter told accused no.4 that she will try to persuade her brother Adil to give up his work.
The said incident occurred in the month of September or October 1984.
That the name of fiance of Adil was Rana Kaushal and Adil was engaged with her.

The car was parked outside her house on the road.
The said car was of chocolate colour.
That the accused nos.1 and 3 were also present there.
After about five minutes, Adil left with accused no.2.
At that time her mother Smt.
Khatunbi (PW3) also told Adil that she will also accompany him, however, accused no.2 Jamil told her that the car is not in proper condition.
Adil was carrying money purse containing Rs.150/ and a photograph of his fiance and also railway season ticket.
On 22.11.1984 her mother met her sister Zarina (PW2) in hospital, when her mother complained Zarina that Adil did not return home.
Zarina replied that on 16.11.1984 the accused nos.1 and 2 and one more person had come to her house in torn clothes on their person and they stayed there till 22.11.1984.
That on 23.11.1984 Smt.
Razia visited Kherwadi police station and lodged a missing report bearing no.51 of 1984.
On 24.11.1984 Zarina asked original accused no.4 Sayeed Mistry the whereabouts of Adil.
She received anonymous telephone call that the accused nos.1 and 2 are at Meerut.
She informed the said fact to the Missing Persons Bureau.
Therefore the police officer sent one constable alongwith her husband to Meerut.
The accused nos.1 and 2 could not be arrested and brought at Mumbai as they had obtained the bail order from the Court at Meerut on 18.1.1985.
She registered FIR (Exhibit9) at Kherwadi police station, Bandra, Mumbai thereby expressing suspicion against the appellants being responsible for disappearance of her brother Adil Rashid.

That she did not disclose to the police the description of the car or its make and or its number or its colour as she was in disturbed state of mind on 27.11.1984 (23.11.1984).
By this, the defence has in fact brought on record the improvement in the evidence of PW1 Razia Khan.
The further contradiction that she did not state in any of her statements that Zarina told her mother that on 16.11.1984 the accused nos.1 and 2 and one more person had come to her house with torn clothes on their person has been brought on record.

Smt.
Khatunbi (PW3) informed her that her son Adil had gone with Jamil (accused no.2) and Zahir (accused no.1).
PW2 informed PW3 that accused no.2 and another person had been to her house.
Smt.
Khatunbi (PW3) waited to the house of PW2 till 11.00 p.m. on that date for accused no.2 Jamil.
The accused persons did not come to her house.
That on 23.11.1984 Smt.

PW3 has deposed that she was having six children.
Out of them four were daughters and two were sons.
Out of four daughters, three daughters were residing with their respective husbands and fourth daughter namely Razia (PW1) though married was residing with her along with family.
The original accused no.4 was husband of her sister and he was distantly related to her.
The accused no.4 was having welding factory at Jogeshwari (West).
When her husband died, her son Adil was of 10 years of age.
After Adil completed his 4th standard, he was sent for earning livelihood with accused no.4.
That the accused no.4 earlier used to pay Rs.20/ per day to Adil when he was working on probation and after Adil learnt the work, the accused no.4 and his sons were asking him to do any sort of work.
Although Adil used to work for long time, he was being paid very less.
Therefore her son Adil started his own business of welding in partnership at Gilbert Road, near Bhavans College, Andheri.
Though her son started his business and had hardly completed one month, his business was lucrative.
After Adil started his own business, a period of 15 days thereafter, the accused no.4 came to her house and threatened her son by asking him not to work in partnership but to work with him (accused no.4).
Her son Adil refused to do so.

The accused no.1 Zahir and another friend were also with him.
They were sitting in the car parked on the road.
The said car was of chocolate colour.
PW3 also told them that she would accompany them, when accused no.1 said that he along with Adil and Jamil are going to National Park for outing and that the car is not in proper condition.
Thereafter they went out of the house.
After some time Adil (deceased) came and gave her Rs.900/ and said that if he carries the entire amount, the accused persons would spent all the money.
He kept Rs.150/ out of Rs.900/ with him.
After Adil (deceased) went outside the house with accused no.2 Jamil, she saw that accused no.1 Zahir was standing near the steering wheel of the car and one more person was sitting on the rear side of the car.
As Adil did not return home till 16.11.1984 she made enquiry with his partner Shera Khan to which Shera Khan replied that he does not know the whereabouts of Adil and he is also waiting for him.
That on 18.11.1984 she attended betrothal ceremony of daughter of accused no.4.
She made enquiry with accused no.4 about Adil.
At that time accused no.4 informed her that he received telephone call from his son Jamil that their car had broken down at Vapi and after it was repaired, they would come back.
On 22.11.1984 Zarina (PW2) met her in hospital and informed that in the night of 16.11.1984 Jamil (accused no.2) was at her house with another boy and stayed in the night.
On 23.11.1984 she went to the house of accused no.4 and enquired about Adil to which accused no.4 expressed his ignorance about the same.

Police arrested accused nos.1 and 2 from a Bidi Shop at Nagpada.
The police thereafter showed her two photographs which were of Adil (deceased).

He used to give the said car on hire basis.
That on 12.11.1984 the accused nos.1 and 2 called upon him along with his mechanic Farooq at about 11.30 a.m. to 12 noon.
Farooq informed PW5 that accused nos.1 and 2 wanted his car on hire basis as the family members of the accused nos.1 and 2 wanted to go to Haji Malang.
Farooq also informed that they do not want any driver.
Thereafter he gave his car on hire basis for a period of two days i.e. for 13th and 14th November 1984.
Farooq took the responsibility of bringing back the said car.
The accused nos.1 and 2 took the car on 13.11.1984 at about 9.00 a.m. PW5 made necessary entry in the movement register.
The said car did not return on 14.11.1984.
On 15.11.1984 also the said car did not return.
On 16.11.1984 he received telephone call from accused no.1 to the effect that the car had gone out of order at Vapi and he should sent his mechanic to get it repaired.
On 16.11.1984 at about 5 p.m. the accused nos.1 and 2 along with another person called upon him.
They reported that some problem had occurred at their hands and police are behind them.
When he asked them what they mean by problem, to which they stated that a murder had taken place at their hands and that he should not discuss the said fact to anybody else.
Thereafter the accused nos.1 to 3 left his place by saying that his car was at Advent Pharma at Vapi and he should bring it back to Mumbai.
That after half an hour, the accused no.1 again came to him and told him to give his mechanic so that he will get the said car repaired.
At that time one Subash Singh was working with PW5 and PW5 sent Subash Singh along with appellant no.1.
After 15 minutes said Subash Singh returned and told him that Zahir had left him and was not traceable.
PW5 thereafter contacted Farooq and took the residential address of the accused persons.
PW5 met the father of accused no.1.
He narrated the incident to the father of accused nos.1 and 2 and also the fact about their committal of murder.
The accused no.4 requested PW5, not to lodged complaint to the police as the name of his family will be tarnished.
The accused no.4 subsequently gave him authority letter to bring the car back from Advent Pharma company at Vapi.
The accused no.4 gave a letter in hand writing addressed to one Mr. Kavishwar of Advent Pharma company saying that he should take Rs.100/ from the person and give the car.
That on 19.11.1984 PW5 went to Vapi and met Mr. Kavishwar (PW11.
at Advent Pharma.
PW5 paid Rs.100/ to Mr. Kavishwar to which he (PW11) passed a receipt for the same.
PW5 took the keys of the car and came back to Mumbai.
He kept the car at J.B. Nagar, Andheri in garage.
That during the course of investigation the police seized his car.
That on 16.3.1985 he was called by Kherwadi Police station for identification.
He identified the accused no.3 as a person who had come with accused nos.1 and 2 on 16.11.1984 to threatened him.
In the crossexamination, this witness has admitted that he did not recollect, whether he had made statement before the police that he told them that the accused nos.1 and 2 had come to him and they had taken his car.
That they had committed murder and that they had not returned his car.
That he did not recollect that the accused persons had taken his mechanic and left him in the way.
That he did not recollect whether he should report to the police about the said incident.
The close scrutiny of this witness makes it clear that most of the statements made by this witness in his examinationinchief are either improvements or omissions which have been brought on record at the instance of the appellants in the crossexamination.
At this stage itself
we may note here that the alleged extra judicial confession given by the appellants to this witness according to us is not trustworthy and reliable because the PW5 was a total stranger to the accused person and confiding with him about the crime committed by the accused persons appears to be improbable, as various omissions and improvements have been brought on record by the appellants and we are of the considered opinion that this witness is not trustworthy and his testimony is not reliable.
It is also to be noted here that the alleged extra judicial confession is not inculpatory and is very vague as far as the precise act by any of the accused is concerned.
The tenor of the alleged extra judicial confession is that all the accused jointly confessed before PW5 about their act and there is no indepth specification about culpability of the crime and therefore it will be unsafe to rely on the said alleged extra judicial confession in the present case.11PW6 is Hashmatali Sayyed, a panchwitness to the spot which was pointed out by the accused no.1 where according to the prosecution the appellants had thrown the dead body of Adil Rashid (deceased).
This witness has proved the memorandum panchanama (Exhibit28) and the spot panchanama (Exhibit28A).In the crossexamination, this witness has admitted that there were about 25 huts where the jeep was halted near the spot and the police did not make any enquiry with the hutment dwellers in his presence.12.
PW7 is Sharad Raut.
The accused no.3 Abdul Guddu in presence of this witness made a demonstration that a pant which was found on the dead body of Adil Rashid fits him.
It is the case of the prosecution that after committing the murder of Adil, a full pant of Adil was worn by the accused no.3 and accused no.3 in turn put on his pant on the dead body of Adil.
It is to be noted here that the clothes which were found on the dead body of Adil were already in possession of the police and the aforesaid demonstration in presence of PW7 according to us is a redundant and futile exercise to connect the link in the chain of circumstances.
According to us the evidence of this witness cannot be taken into consideration for connecting alleged link of chain of circumstances put forth by the prosecution.
It appears from the evidence of this witness that a pant which was recovered in the presence of this witness, which according to the prosecution was of Adil was not shown to any of the witnesses for its identification.
We therefore keep aside the evidence of this witness from our consideration.13.
PW8 is Surajbali Patel, a panchwitness to the discovery of the incriminating articles at the behest of the accused nos.2 and 3.
This witness has deposed that on 20.3.1985 at the instance of accused no.2 a wallet of deceased which he had thrown in the adjoining company of Advent Pharma was discovered at his instance.
At the instance of accused no.3 four nylon pieces of strings, 8 to 9 pieces of torn railway ticket were discovered from an open ground of the Advent Pharma company wherein the grass had grown upto 1 and feet.
The accuse no.3 also produced 4 to 5 torn pieces of a photograph of a girl from the said place.
In the same process the accused no.2 also discovered a wallet of the deceased from an open space.
PW8 has stated that there was nala at that place and accused no.2 jumped over the said nala and went inside the compound from the side of nala.
That there was grass at the said place.
That the accused no.2 jumped over the barbedwire and went inside the compound.
The said place was opposite of Advent Pharma Company.
This witness did not recollect the name of the company.
The accused no.2 searched for the wallet and traced it out.
In the wallet there was visiting card having writing something like Shera Company or Shera Welding.
It is to be noted here that the evidence of PW8 is absolutely silent about the exact place from where the incriminating articles were discovered at the instance of the accused nos.2 and 3.
It is is to be noted here that the date of incident in question is 15.11.1984 or there about and the discovery at the instance of the accused nos.2 and 3 was effected on 20.3.1985 i.e. after about four months from the date of incident.
The evidence so also the said discovery panchanamas at Exhibits 33 and 33A are silent about the condition of the articles, particularly the papers which were smeared by soil, so also their stage of degradation and its appearance and the depth of ditch pit dug by accused no.3.
There is another aspect of the Exhibits 33 and 33A. The memorandum panchanama of accused nos.2 and 3 is a joint memorandum which is at Exhibits 33 and in pursuance of the joint memorandum panchanama, the said articles were discovered.
It is to be noted here that the statement made by accused no.3 Guddu first in point of time, it is apparent that the police had already knowledge about the place wherein the accused no.3 had either buried the articles in presence of accused no.2.
It further appears to us that the discovery at the instance of accused nos.2 and 3 though projected as a separate discovery is in fact a joint discovery and according to us is not safe to rely upon it.
We may note here that the police officer who effected the discovery in pursuance of joint memorandum statements which is Exhibit 33 is ignorant about legal implications of joint discovery at the instance of accused persons.14.
PW9 is Jogabhai Patel, the owner of the hotel adjacent to Advent Pharma Company at GIDC, Vapi.
It appears that this witness has been examined with a view to establish the fact that four months prior to 20.3.1985 the accused persons had been to his hotel early in the morning.15.
PW13 is Jayant Aher, the handwriting expert who has examined the letter given by accused no.4 in favour of Mr. Jagannath Kavishwar (PW11) for releasing the car by PW5 Kishor Dadhich.
As the accused no.4 is expired and the case against him stood abated, the evidence of this witness cannot be taken into consideration from the point of deciding the present appeal.16.
PW16 is Haji Abdul Bidiwala from whose shop the accused nos.1 and 2 were arrested on 31.1.1985 by the police.
This witness has failed to identify the accused persons in the Court.
PW17 is Sukhdeo Dhaktode, Police Constable who had gone to Delhi along with PW18 Akhtar Khan (husband of PW1 Razia) in search of accused nos.1 and 2 on 9.12.1984.
The record discloses that the statements of aforesaid three witnesses i.e. PW16, PW17 and PW18 came to be recorded after lapse of 10 years and just prior to the commencement of the trial and therefore it creates strong doubt in our mind about the reliability of their evidence and we refrain ourselves from taking into consideration the evidence of these three witnesses.17.

On 4.31985, his statement was recorded by Police Inspector Khambe (PW21).21.
PW20 is Dr. Subhash S. Patil, the then Medical Officer at Masvan Primary Health Centre, Taluka Palghar, DistrictThane.
PW20 has deposed that on 16.11.1984 at about 2.30 p.m. the dead body of unknown person was brought from village Durvesh by the police from Manor Police station.

He had further stated that injures noted in the postmortem examination might be caused due to strings like Article14 shown to him.22.
PW12 is Udaychandra Panickar, the Special Executive Magistrate who had conducted test identification parade on accused no.3 Guddu.
As far as evidence of this witness is concerned who has conducted the test identification parade, we may note here that this witness in his examination in chief itself has stated that the test identification parade was held in the premises of police station which is contrary to the settled position of law till date led down by this Court.
Secondly the memorandum of identification parade (Exhibit 39) a contemporaneous document on record discloses in equivocable terms that this witness had given suggestions to the witness prior to the test identification parade and the concerned witness thereafter identified the accused no.3.
We are of the considered opinion that the same cannot be countenanced.
For these two stated reasons we discard the test identification parade held by PW12 from our consideration.23.
PW19 is Abdul Kadar A. Khan, PSI then attached to Kherwadi Police station.
PW19 has deposed that on 23.11.1984 at about 6.40 p.m. one Mrs. Razia Khan (PW1) came to police station and lodged a missing complaint of her brother.
The same was entered at serial no.51 of 1984 (Exhibit8).
On 27.11.1984 he received instructions from the Senior Inspector of Police to conduct detailed enquiry in the matter and accordingly he recorded statements of Razia (PW1) and Zarina (PW2) and accused no.4 and submitted a report to the Senior Inspector of Police.
He also sent wireless messages to all the police stations pertaining to said Adil Rashid.
That on 12.12.1984 the accused no.4 met him and informed that the accused nos.1 and 2 were also missing with Adil Rashid and were traced by Civil Line Police Station, Meerut and they had been released on bail by his younger brother.
That on 15.12.1984 he received letter from the Senior Inspector of Police Missing Persons Bureau, Crime Branch that the said officer has conducted enquiry into the matter and submitted a report (Exhibit69).
In the said report, it was stated that when Civil Line Police Station, Meerut enquired with Zahir and Jamil (accused nos.1 and 2), it was informed to them by the accused persons that the missing person (Adil) departed with them from Andheri Railway station on the said date.
That on 19.1.1985 under the orders of Superiors he registered CR No.33 of 1985 under Sections 365 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code against the accused nos.1 and 2 at Kherwadi police station.
The said FIR is at Exhibit9.
PW19 thereafter went to Meerut and Delhi in search of Adil.
However, Adil was not found.
He also searched accused nos.1 and 2.
But they were also not found.
That when he contacted Civil Line Police Station, Meerut, the officer therein informed him that on 28.1.1985 the accused no.4 took the custody of his sons (accused nos.1 and 2) and promised to produce them at Mumbai.
That on 31.1.1985 at about 6.30 p.m. he arrested accused nos.1 and 2 from the shop of Haji Abdul Bidiwala (PW16).
He subsequently added Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code to CR No.33 of 1985.
That the further investigation was handed over to Police Inspector Shri Khambe (PW21) to whom PW19 assisted in the case.24.
PW21 is Shri Bhimrao Khambe, Police Inspector then attached to Kherwadi Police station.
PW21 has deposed that on 1.2.1985 he took over the further investigation of CR No.33 of 1985 registered at Kherwadi police station from PSI Shri Khan (PW19) as per the orders of the Superior Officer.
He collected the papers of investigation.
PSI Shri Khan (PW19) assisted him in the said case.
On 2.2.1985 the accused no.1 made voluntary statement and expressed his willingness to show the place where the dead body of Adil was thrown.
The accused nos.1 and 2 led the police to village Durvesh village on Western Express Highway near the mile stone no.443/4 and accused no.1 pointed out the place where the body was thrown.
The detail panchanama came to be recorded which is at Exhibit 28.
The accused no.1 thereafter led the police to the Advent Pharma Co. at Vapi and pointed out the person namely Kavishwar (PW11).
This witness has deposed about various facts pertaining to the steps taken by him during the course of investigation upto the stage of filing of chargesheet in the Court.25.
After scrutinizing the entire evidence available on record minutely, it is thus clear that the present case is based on circumstantial evidence.
It is the settled position of law that in a case of circumstantial evidence the circumstances on which the prosecution relies must be consistent with the sole hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.
In a case resting on circumstantial evidence, it is incumbent for the prosecution to prove each and every circumstance on which it proposes to rely.
The circumstances so proved should be of conclusive nature i.e. they should have a definite tendency of implicating the accused.
The circumstances so established should form a complete chain which should exclude every hypothesis of innocence and unquestionably point towards the guilt of the accused.
In other words the circumstances should be conclusive i.e. accused and the accused alone has committed the crime.26.
The Supreme Court in its celebrated judgment in the case of Hanumant Govind Nargundkar V. State of M.P., reported in 1952 SCR 1091 AIR 1952 SC 343 1953 Cri L.J. 129 has held thatIt is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.
Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.
In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.27.
It is further the settled position of law that in order to sustain a conviction for murder on circumstantial evidence, the following conditions must be fulfilled(1)
The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established.(2) The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty.(3)
The circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency.(4) They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and(5)
There must by a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.28.
The minute scrutiny of evidence on record discloses that following circumstances have been put forth by the prosecution against the appellants accused persons(1) motive(2) last seen together(3) extra judicial confession given to PW5(4) abscondance after the alleged commission of crime going to Meerut and staying there(5) destruction of evidence(6) incriminating articles discovered at the instance of accused nos.2 and 329.
In the present case the identity of deceased Adil Rashid is not in dispute as the mother of deceased (PW3) had identified and admitted the photograph of Adil in her testimony.30.
The learned Counsel for the appellants submitted that in the present case the chain of circumstances has not been proved by the prosecution and it has been broken at various stages and therefore the benefit of doubt may be advanced to the accused persons.
She has further submitted that as the place of recovery of dead body was not in exclusive possession of the accused persons, the accused persons cannot be held responsible for the same.
In support of her contention, she relied on two decisions of the Supreme Court reported in AIR 1956 SC 316 in the case of Eradu Ors.
Vs.
State of Hyderabad and 1992 Cri.
L.J. 4027 in the case of Anant Bhujangarao Kulkarni Vs.
State of Maharashtra.31.
It is to be noted here that the deceased was last seen together with the accused person by PW Nos.1 and 3 i.e. sister and mother of the deceased Adil.
These witnesses have stated that on 15.11.1984 at about 11.30 a.m. they saw Adil in the company of accused persons in chocolate colour Ambassador car.
It is to be noted here that these witnesses have not given any specific and or distinctive features and or number of the said car at the inception to the police.
As far as PW1 Razia is concerned, it has been brought on record by the defence that the description given by her is an omission.
PW4 is a panchwitness to the discovery of car at the instance of accused persons, has stated that when he saw the car in the Court it was a white colour car.
Thus a person who due to darkness could not see the registration number or make of car and could not have seen the colour of seats in it as doors were locked, identifies it after 10 years due to its number plate though its colour was changed.
This identification of car (Art.9) is after 10 years.
Identity of car in this matter is the most important link.
Even its owner PW5 Kishore or then PW10 Bahadursingh (Peon at Advent Pharma) are not asked to identify it.
PW11 Kavishwar, a Chemist at Advent Pharma who speaks about visit of accused Zahir on 16.11.1984, though gives registration number of car, does not depose that he saw that car in company premises.
In chief, at first place he speaks of visit of Zahir on 11.11.1984 while at other place he points out that date to be 16.11.1984.
In xerox copy of visit book dated 19.11.1984, visit of PW5 appears to be recorded as visit by one Kishore Sharma.
Thus, last name of PW5 is not correctly recorded.
Even entry of visit of Zahir on 16.11.1984 appears to be not proper.
Name Zahir appears to be stated later on and at end vehicle number is also written.
PW11 mentions this visit book as inward register and its original is not produced by the prosecution.
Thus, the entire evidence is not convincing to conclude visit of Zahir to M s. Advent Pharma on 16.11.1984 or leaving of a car by him there.
In our opinion, the prosecution has failed to prove by leading cogent evidence with respect to specifications of the car by which the accused persons along with deceased Adil travelled on 15.11.1984.A useful reference at this stage can be made to a decision of the Supreme Court reported in 2015(9)
SCALE 513 in the case of Nizam Ors.
Vs.
State of Rajasthan, wherein in paragraph18 the Supreme Court has held that, where the time gap is long, it would be unsafe to base conviction on last seen theory.
It is further held that it is safer to look for corroboration from other circumstances and evidence adduced by the prosecution.
In the present case, the deceased was last seen in the company of accused persons on 15.11.1984 at 11.30 a.m.
The dead body was found noticed on 16.11.1984 at about 7.30 a.m to 7.45 a.m. by Pandu Parade (PW14) at village Durvesh, TalPalghar DistrictThane.
In view of the ration laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Nizam Ors (supra) the time gap between last seen together and finding of dead body is too long to hold the appellants guilty for the murder of Adil on the said count, only on the basis of last seen together theory.
It is to be noted here that the accused persons have since beginning taken consistent stand that they departed with Adil at Andheri railway station.
The said fact can also be enumerated from Exhibit 69 a letter written by the Senior Inspector of Police of Missing Persons Bureau to the Senior Inspector of Police of Kherwadi Police station.
In our considered opinion, the appellants cannot be held guilty for and only on this count.
The prosecution has failed to establish the fact that the possibility of any other person other than the accused persons committing the murder of Adil, cannot be ruled out by leading succinct and cogent evidence in that behalf.
It is also to be noted here that though the accused no.1 in presence of PW6 pointed out the place where the dead body of Adil was thrown, the police of Manor police station were already aware of the said spot and therefore pointing of place by the accused no.1 loses its significance.
The lapse of noncoordination between the two investigating agencies cannot be held to be an aggravating circumstance against the accused persons.32.
As far as the alleged motive behind the crime i.e. deceased Adil has separated from accused no.4 and started his own business, the newly started business of Adil was flourished and therefore the accused persons were having jealousy against the deceased Adil.
The said motive has been proved by Razia (PW1) and Smt.
Khatunbi (PW3).33.
The next circumstance of abscondance of the accused persons till their arrest itself cannot be treated as clinching circumstance against them.
The learned Counsel for the appellants relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court reported in 1992 Cri. L.J. 2320 in the case of Rajinder Singh alias Kada Vs.
State of Punjab wherein in paragraph13 the Supreme Court has held as underThe abscondance of the accused relied upon by the High Court remains of no consequence.
In the first place it is not a determining factor and not one which could outweigh the other material appearing on the record.
It by itself does not establish the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.
It is a settled principle of law that absconding may lend weight to the other evidence establishing the guilt of an accused, but, by itself, is hardly any evidence of guilt.
The conduct of an accused making himself scarce for some period is relevant under S.8 of the Evidence Act and may be indicative to some extent of a guilty mind, but it would not be conclusive evidence of his guilt.
Even innocent persons may, when suspected of grave crimes, attempt to evade arrest.
Such is the instinct of self preservation in an average human being.
Absconding is a weak link in the chain of circumstances and is not conclusive either of guilt or a guilt conscience.
Even assuming that the fact of absconding has been established by the prosecution, it cannot be held that the appellants were the author of the crime in the absence of evidence pointing to their guilt.
Thus merely because the accused persons were absconding after a particular date itself cannot be treated as determining factor and their guilt in the present offence.34.
The learned Counsel for the appellants then would contend that the alleged extra judicial confession given to Kishor Dadhich (PW5) cannot be relied upon as it was given to a total stranger.
In support of her contention, she relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Tarseem Kumar Vs.
The Delhi Administration reported in AIR 1994 SC 2585 wherein the Supreme Court has held that extra judicial confession made before stock witness who was casually knowing accused is not acceptable.
In the present case also as we have stated in the forgoing paragraph, PW5 Kishor Dadhich was a total stranger to the accused persons and the accused persons on two occasions confiding with him and making an extra judicial confession about their guilt, is highly improbable.
PW5 was neither their friend nor of acquaintance with whom they can easily make confession.
It is further worth to be noted that even after the accused persons made confession with the said PW5, PW5 did not report to the police immediately.
PW5 has given clarification that as the accused no.4 has requested him not to mention the same to the police with a view to save his reputation, is unacceptable.
We find the testimony of PW5 is untrustworthy and unreliable.35.
This leads us to last circumstance of discovery of incriminating articles at the instance of accused nos.2 and 3 from the Advent Pharma Company.
The date of incident in the present case is stated to be between 15th November 1984 and 16th November 1984.
The articles belonging to Adil Rashid were discovered at the instance of accused nos.2 and 3 from the Advent Pharma Company at Vapi on 20.3.1985 i.e. after about four months from the date of incident.
It is to be noted here that the contemporaneous documents i.e. memorandum panchanama Exhibits 33 and discovery panchanama Exhibit 33A are absolutely silent about the specification of the ditch pit from where the accused no.3 Guddu discovered nylon strings, 10 torn pieces of Western railway season ticket, 9 pieces of torn visiting card, four torn pieces of photograph of a girl etc.
It is to be noted here that the evidence of PW8 and the said contemporaneous documents Exhibits 33 and 33A are absolutely silent about the condition of the said articles found after a gap of four months that whether those were degraded, decomposed smeared with soil or otherwise.
The evidence depicts the picture that the said articles were in proper condition as if they were new.
It is therefore very unsafe to rely on the evidence of PW8 and those contemporaneous documents Exhibits 33 and 33A (discovery panchanama) for basing the conviction of the accused persons on the said circumstance.36.
In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that the prosecution has not proved the guilt of the appellants satisfactorily and beyond all reasonable doubts.
We therefore give benefit of doubt to the appellants and allow the present appeal and set aside the conviction and sentences awarded to the appellants.
The bail bonds of the appellants stand cancelled.37.
The Appeal is accordingly allowed.
