The appellants did not accede to the said request and informed the respondents vide letter dated 16th February 2004, stating that the agreement is for performing the contract upto 100 of awarded value and provision of executing extra 30 quantity on the same terms and conditions.
The respondents requested the appellants vide letter dated 9th May 2004 to extend the time frame for completion of the remaining contract upto 15th July 2004 as the contract period was only till 15th April, 2004.

MINER/200304/001 DATED 23.04.2003.Dear Sir,Management is fully aware that tender rate of Rs. 17/ per Cum for the work is all time low and wholly unworkable.
We are working at this rate at a colossal loss.
We started the work almost at the approach of monsoon on 16.04.2003 and we could not also speed up progress because of transportation restriction between 11.00 A.M. 4.00 P.M. against heat wave alert and thereafter onset of heavy rains consequenting upon bad, waterlogged slippery road followed by short supply of rakes.
With all these operational hazards beyond our control, we could accomplish 34.74 Lakhs Cum upto 31.03.2004.As our financial loss was soaring day by day, we had requested for foreclosure of the work after we have completed 70 of the work but this was not agreed to by GM(TC) vide his letter No. 1251 dated 26.03.2004.Therefore, being under contractual obligation we had, no other alternative but to apply for extension of time upto 15.07.2004 and would request you to kindly treat the contract as closed with the completion of the above awarded quantity as we are illafford to bear further loss.
Thanking You,Yours faithfully,Sd For Dhansar Engineering Co. Pvt.

This request of the respondents was considered by the appellants in its 68th Meeting of the Board.
Extension of three months time was granted while reserving the right to impose penalty.
The respondents were informed accordingly vide letter dated 5th June 2004.
As a result of this decision, the contract period was extended until 15th July 2004 on the same terms and conditions agreed upon.
As the contract period was subsisting till 15th July 2004, the appellants issued an approval order dated 11th June 2004 to increase of 30 extra quantity i.e. 14.8 Lakh cubic meter at the existing rate of next tender rate or whichever is lower, amounting to Rs. 252.42 Lakh.
The respondents by letter dated 11th June 2004, however, reiterated that the contract be treated as closed  as they were on the verge of completing the quantity specified in the contract by 15th June 2004.

And for this act of Kindness the Petitioner shall as in duty bound ever pray.13.
The Writ Petition was opposed by the appellants by filing reply affidavit.
The appellants raised preliminary objection about the maintainability of the Writ Petition.
On merits, the appellants asserted that the demand raised against the respondents was in accord with the terms and conditions of the contract and if the respondents were aggrieved by the same they were free to resort to the procedure for settlement under clause 31 of the agreement.
The Division Bench of the High Court, however, allowed the Writ Petition preferred by the respondents on the finding that it was not permissible for the appellants to allot extra work to the respondents at the fag end of the contract period in terms of clause 5 of the contract which envisaged giving 45 clear days notice for variation of the quantity under the contract.
That notice was given to the respondents only on 11th June 2004 even though the extended contract period was to expire on 15th July 2004.
The Court held that, surprisingly after extending the contract period on 5th June 2004, within six days on 11th June 2004 the appellants decided to enhance the contract quantity by 30.
That was not a bonafide act and was unacceptable.
The Court also held that the appellants had not offered any explanation as to in what circumstances decision to impose penalty was taken by the Board of Directors.
The Court further noted that the respondents had executed the contract upto 108.47 at a very low rate, and incurred heavy losses in that regard.
Further, a new contract for Lakhanpur OCP was already awarded and there was no loss of production caused to the appellants.
On these basis, the Division Bench allowed the Writ Petition in the following terms16.
Accordingly, the letter dated 8.12.2004 of the General Manager (T.C) Mahanadi Coalfields Limited under Annexure22 proposing to levy shortfall penalty as well as, its Approval Order dated 03.11.2005 under AnnexureA to the counter affidavit are hereby quashed.
The outstanding dues payable to the petitioner be released in its favour within the period of thirty days along with simple interest 8 per annum to be computed from the date of conclusion of contract, i.e. from 16.7.2004.
The bank guarantee furnished by the petitioners, pursuant to the direction of this Court dated 28.7.2009 are hereby directed to be cancelled and consequently, directed that the same be returned to the petitioners forthwith.
The writ petition is allowed with the aforesaid terms.
No Costs.14.
Aggrieved, the appellants have filed the present appeal.
This Court passed an interim order on 12th April, 2013, directing to maintain status quo as it existed on that date until further orders.15.
According to the appellants the High Court has committed manifest error in entertaining the Writ Petition.
Firstly, in respect of a purely contractual matter and moreso when efficacious remedy under clause 31 of the contract was available to the respondents for redressal of their grievance.
Secondly, on merits the High Court has misconstrued and misapplied the contractual terms and in particular clause 5 of the contract.
However, if the terms and conditions of the contract are read as a whole, it leaves no manner of doubt that the appellants had the discretion to extend the original contract period and having done so at the request of the respondents, the respondents were bound by the terms of the contract till 15th July 2004.
Further, before that date at any point of time, it was open to the appellants to reduce or increase the contract quantity upto 30.
The sole plea of the respondents for their inability to perform the contract was founded on financial difficulty and sufferance of further loss due to low contract rate.
That can be no consideration for walking out of the contract.
Moreso, after the extra quantity was allocated the respondents could have asked for further time for completing the extra work, if they were not in a position to complete the same within the contract period.
That request could have been considered by the appellants appropriately.
The respondents did not do so.
Instead, they insisted to withdraw from operation merely because the rate of contract was not affordable to them.
Resultantly, the appellants had to allot the extra quantity of unfinished work by the respondents, to third party at a higher rate.
The fact that the appellants did not suffer any loss of production, it does not follow that no financial loss was suffered by the appellants due to higher rate paid for the unfinished extra work.
The appellants were, therefore, justified in recovering the difference of rate in respect of unfinished extra work and penalty therefore.
That was a legitimate demand under the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties.16.
The respondents, on the other hand, contend that it was unfair on the part of the appellants not to allow the respondents to close the contract as per the original contract and within the extended contract period i.e. upto 15th July 2004.
Further, the respondents cannot be made liable for the unfinished extra quantity of work as that was allotted only on 11th June 2004, leaving very little time for the respondents to complete the same for which the appellants should blame themselves.
According to the respondents, the High Court was right in concluding that clause 5 of the agreement did not permit the appellants to allot an extra quantity of work to the extent of 30 at the fag end of the extended contract period, absent 45 clear days notice mandated therein.
Further, the High Court has passed an equitable order also keeping in mind that the respondents had already executed 108.47 of the contract work by suffering heavy losses, which fact is substantiated from the execution of new contract at the rate of Rs.31.50 per cubic meter as against the rate of Rs.17/ per cubic meter payable to the respondents.
It is also contended that the demand for penalty amount is unilateral and without any just cause.
The same is illegal.
Hence, contends the learned counsel, the appeal be dismissed.17.
Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at some length, we find force in the plea of the appellants.
The challenge in the Writ Petition filed by the respondents was limited to the letter dated 8th December 2004, issued by the General Manager of the appellants.
The respondents had not challenged the extension of contract period till 15th July 2004 vide letter dated 5th June 2004, the decision of the appellants to allot an extra quantity of 30 work and much less the decision of the Board to impose penalty taken on 27th October, 2005 and communicated to the respondents vide Approval Order dated 3rd November 2005.
The High Court, however, has not only set aside the letter dated 8th December 2004 but also the Approval Order dated 3rd November 2005.18.
For doing so, the High Court has taken support from clause 5 of the Contract.
That clause cannot be read in isolation.
The other terms and conditions of the contract must be read as a whole.
Clause 5 of the agreement dated 26th May 2003 posits authority in the appellants to reduce or increase the tendered quantity by 30, whilst the contract is subsisting.
Indisputably, the original contract period was upto 15th April, 2004.
At the instance of these respondents, the same stood extended till 15th July 2004.
The extra 30 work was allotted to the respondents on 11th June 2004, before expiry of the extended contract period i.e. 15th July 2004.
As the contract period was extended and that decision was allowed to attain finality, it inevitably obliged the respondents to fulfill all the contractual stipulations under the original agreement including to complete the assigned quantity of work  be it original quantity or extra quantity  before 15th July 2004.
The fact that they had to suffer financial loss due to low contract rate could not be cited as an excuse to extricate from that contractual obligation.19.
Failure to comply with the contractual obligation of executing the original quantity of work or the extra work, as the case may be, must visit the respondents with liability to compensate the appellants in terms of other express clauses of the contract to the extent of unfinished work and in particular the financial loss suffered by the appellants for getting the same work executed through a third agency at a higher rate.
The fact that the respondents executed 108.47 of work before 15th July 2004, could be no justification to relieve them of their obligation to compensate the appellants with suitable amount for the unfinished contract work (out of 130).20.
Presumably to get over this position, the respondents relying on clause 5 of the agreement would contend that the extra quantity of work could not be allotted to them, absent 45 clear days notice that too at the fag end of the contract period.
This argument, in our opinion, is a complete misreading of the said clause.
It is one thing to say that the contractor should be given sufficient time to complete the extra work commensurate with the extra quantity required to be executed by him.
However, in law, it is not open to contend that even though the contract period is still subsisting, the principal (appellants) could not have exercised its option to increase the quantity of work to the extent permissible under that clause, to be executed by the contractor within the contract period.
The principal (appellants) could be asked to exercise their option to extend the contract period beyond 15th July, 2004, to enable the respondents to complete the unfinished extra work.
If such request were to be made by the respondents, there would have been corresponding obligation on the appellants to extend the contact period commensurate with the increased quantity of work in terms of clause 5 of the agreement.
The respondents, instead, opted to walk out of the contract for the sole reason that the contract rate agreed by them was very low and was causing financial loss to them.
That can be no just reason to not fulfill their contractual obligation.21.
Relying on the third sentence (last sentence) in clause 5, it was contended that the employer could not have increased the tendered quantity in absence of 45 clear days notice.
We agree with the appellants that the said stipulation would come into play only if the respondents were also called upon to increase the machine capacity by upto 30 extra daily quantity.
In the present case, the appellants merely allotted extra 30 quantity without requiring the respondents to increase the daily quantity.
There is marked difference between increasing the extra quantity during the contract period and that of increasing the extra daily quantity.
In the case of latter, the contractor would be required to step up the machine capacity for which giving of 45 clear days notice to him is necessary.
Suffice it to observe that the stipulation in the third sentence of clause 5 providing for 45 clear days notice was not an impediment for the appellants to allot extra quantity of work upto 30, whilst the contract period was subsisting.22.
The respondents had then relied on the notings of the Project Officer dated 26th January 2005 to contend that assigning of extra work to the respondents at the fag end of the contract period was doubted even by the said officer.
The observations of the Project Officer cannot be the basis to construe the scope of Clause 5 of the contract.
Besides, it was only an interdepartmental communication which was duly considered at different level in the office of the appellants, but finally it is the decision of the Board of Directors of the appellants that must prevail.
As a matter of fact, Clause 5 of the agreement empowers the appellants to increase or reduce the quantity of work upto permissible limit whilst the contract was subsisting.
That power having been exercised, the obligation of the contractor to complete the extra work in terms of the subject contract within the contract period or extended contract period was imperative.
The respondents are not right in contending that the appellantsCompany had no authority to grant extension of time to complete the enhanced quantity.
This contention deserves to be stated to be rejected, keeping in mind the other contractual terms such as Clause 11.0  providing for variation in the scheduled quantity, extent and rate Clause 13  time for completion of contract and more particularly Clause 14.0  for extension of date of completion.
Clause 14.0 (e) was available and ought to have been invoked by the respondents in this situation.
It postulates that for any other cause not specifically provided in subclauses (a) to (d) of the same Clause, at the sole discretion of the appellants, the date of completion could be extended, if it was found to be necessary because of situation beyond the control of the contractor.
That clause could be invoked for the situation in which the respondents were placed due to extra work allocated to them at the fag end of the contract (extended) period.23.
In our opinion, clause 5 did not prohibit the principal (appellants) to allot upto extra 30 quantity of work, for want of 45 clear days of subsisting contract period.
Whereas, that option could be exercised by the appellants at any time until the contract period was subsisting, which in this case was until 15th July 2004.
In the present case, such notice regarding increase of work upto 30 permissible under clause 5 of the agreement, was given on 11th June 2004.
On this finding, it must follow that the respondents committed breach of their contractual obligation, in not completing the balance work out of 130 of work (i.e. 130  108.47).
To that extent the respondents became liable to compensate the appellants including by way of penalty and in particular towards the financial loss caused to the appellants due to assigning the unfinished work to a third agency (contractor) at a higher rate.
The amount demanded by the appellants includes the difference of contractual rate and the actual loss suffered by the appellants for completing the unfinished work through a third agency (contractor) at a higher rate, as is noticed from the communication dated 8th December 2004 sent to the respondents.24.
The respondents, would then contend that, the appellants without giving any opportunity to the respondents unilaterally imposed penalty and despite the noting of the General Manager that there was no loss of production to the appellants.
Similarly, a doubt was expressed by the Project Officer regarding giving extra work to the respondents at the fag end of the contract period.
The respondents have relied on the decision of this Court in Maula Bux vs. Union of India (1969) 2 SCC 554 ), in which it has been held that where a sum is named in the contract in the nature of a penalty, where loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming compensation must prove the loss suffered by it.
It is, however, indisputable that financial loss was suffered by the appellants on account of assigning the unfinished work to a third agency (contractor) at a higher rate.
In that, the contract rate for the same work to be done by the respondents would have been at Rs. 17/ per cubic meter, which the appellants were required to get it executed at the rate of Rs. 31.50 per cubic meter through a third agency.
The fact that no loss of production was suffered by the appellants cannot relieve the respondents of that liability.
It is a different matter that the respondents were not put to notice before the final decision was taken by the appellants to recover the financial loss along with penalty.
The respondents could have approached the appellants for reconsideration of their demand towards penalty, in terms of Clause 30.3 of the contract and persuade the appellants to waive the penalty amount to be recovered from them.
The respondents, however, chose to straightway approach the High Court by way of Writ Petition.
Notably, the High Court has not set aside the penalty amount as such, but the entire demand being impermissible.
Since we have reversed the findings and conclusion of the High Court and even if this appeal succeeds, the respondents can be granted an opportunity to make a representation to the Appellants  company, who in turn can deal with the same in accordance with law.
If the appellants accept the claim of the respondents about the unjustness of penalty or quantum thereof, they would be free to withdraw or modify their claim for recovery of penalty amount, if so advised.
In the event, the appellants reject the representation, they will be free to recover the amount as demanded towards penalty along with interest accrued thereon, as may be permissible in law.
However, that would not absolve the respondents from the financial liability arising due to difference of rate of contract and the actual cost incurred by the appellants to complete the unfinished work out of 130 of the contract quantity, through a third agency at a higher rate.
That can be recovered by the appellants from the respondents along with interest accrued thereon at such rate, as may be permissible in law, even if the representation made by the respondents for recall or modification of the penalty amount is pending consideration.
Considering the above, it is not necessary for us to burden this judgment with the contention of the respondents that the penalty imposed without any notice or hearing to the respondents is vitiated as also the decisions relied in support of that contention in the case of Gorkha Security Services vs. Government (NCT of Delhi) Ors.
(2014) 9 SCC 105 )and Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi Ors vs. State of U.P. (1991) 1 SCC 212 )25.
Similarly, it is not necessary for us to burden this judgment with the decisions relied on by the respondents, to contend that existence of alternative remedy is no bar to entertain a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, as held in the cases of Popcorn Enterainment vs. City Development Corporation (2007) 9 SCC 593 ), Harbanslal Sahnia Anr.
vs. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Ors.
(2003) 2 SCC 107 ), Union of India Ors. vs.
Tantia Construction Pvt. Ltd.
(2011)5 SCC 697) , M.P. State Agro Industries Development Corpn.
Anr.
Vs. Jahan Khan (2007) 10 SCC 88 )and Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai (1998) 8 SCC 1 ).
For, we have already examined the merits of the controversy and more so granted liberty to the respondents to make representation to the appellants on the question of justness of the demand towards penalty or the quantum thereof.
It will be open to the respondents to pursue remedy in that behalf, as may be permissible in law.
We are not expressing any opinion one way or the other on the issue of penalty amount.
All questions in that behalf are left open.26.
Accordingly, we partly allow this appeal.
The judgment of the Division Bench dated 7th November 2012 is set aside.
The reliefs claimed by the respondents in the Writ Petition are disposed of in the above terms.27.
The appeal is partly allowed in the above terms with no order as to costs.
