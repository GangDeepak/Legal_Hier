Clause (1) of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Act stipulates that a member of the Institute, whether in practice or not, shall be deemed to be guilty of professional misconduct if he contravenes any of the provisions of the Act or the regulations made thereunder or any guidelines issued by the Council of the Institute.

5. Learned senior counsel submits that in order to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, conflict of decisions and also settle the law comprehensively, which is a question of law of general public importance, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India being the regulatory body for the profession of Chartered Accountants has filed the present transfer petitions for transfer of all the aforesaid writ petitions to this Court for final and conclusive determination of the issues involved.
6.
Shri R. Basant, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent and other counsels have submitted that there is no good reason for transfer of the writ petitions pending in the different High Courts.
it is submitted that the only reason of transfer of the writ petitions is convenience of the petitioners, whereas the constitutional protection and right availed by the writ petitioners under Article 226 of the Constitution will be taken away, if the transfer is allowed.
The provisions of Article 139A is an exception to the general rule of law, which can be exercised only rarely and in exceptional circumstances.
By the impugned Guidelines, the applicants have introduced a cap on the number of audit assignments that can be taken up by each Chartered Accountant throughout the country irrespective of the nature of the audit, the nature and volume of business of the clients, the local conditions, local laws, the place of practice of each Chartered Accountant etc., all these questions are important while deciding the question of breach of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
It is necessary that this Court may have the advantage of the judgments of different High Courts in different parts of the country.
It is submitted that there are earlier occasions where such transfer petitions have been dismissed.
It is further submitted that in event, it is found necessary to transfer all writ petitions be transferred to one High Court instead of transferring petitions to this Court.
It is lastly submitted by learned counsel for the respondent that in several writ petitions, various interim orders are operating in favour of the writ petitioners, which may be allowed to continue.
7.
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the records.
8. Section 44AB of the Incometax Act, 1961 was inserted in the statute book by the Finance Act, 1984 and the same came into force w.e.f. 01.04.1985.
Section 44AB provides that every person carrying on business, if his total sales, turnover or gross receipts exceed Rs.1 crore, and every person carrying on a profession, if his gross receipts exceed Rs.50 lakhs, in any previous year, is required to get his accounts of such previous year audited by a Chartered Accountant, and obtain before the specified date, a report of the audit in the prescribed form duly signed and verified by such Chartered Accountant.
The said provisions are popularly called compulsory tax audits.
The said Section 44AB had been enacted to prevent evasion of taxes, plug loopholes enabling tax avoidance and also facilitate tax administration, which would ensure that the economic system does not result in concentration of wealth to the common detriment.
The said section therefore fulfilled the directive principles laid down under Article 39(c) of the Constitution of India.
9.
In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause (ii) of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Act, the council of the Institute issued a notification bearing No.1CA(7)/3/88 dated 13.01.1989 specifying that a member of the Institute in practice shall be deemed to be guilty of professional misconduct, if he accepts in a financial year, more than specified number of tax audit assignments under Section 44AB of the Incometax Act, 1961.

In various writ petitions filed in different High Courts apart from challenging the guidelines dated 08.08.2008, disciplinary proceedings initiated against the writ petitioner for violation of the guidelines dated 08.08.2008 were also challenged.
For example, in writ petition No.25662 of 2016, Shaji Poulose versus Institute of Chartered Accountant of India and others, the guidelines dated 08.08.2008 as well as communication dated 28.03.2015, 23.06.2016 and 13.07.2016 were under challenge.
The High Court issued notice and stayed the disciplinary proceeding against the writ petitioner therein.
14.
Learned counsel for the respondents have also relied on the judgment of this Court in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India versus Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation Limited and another, (2007) 15 SCC 649, in which case the Transfer petition was filed in this Court by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India for transferring writ petitions filed in different High Courts challenging Constitutional validity of paragraph 33 of Accounting Standard 22 framed by Institute of Chartered Accountant of India.
This Court allowed the Transfer petition and directed all the writ petitions to be heard by Calcutta High Court.
Learned counsel for the respondent submits that this Court may consider transferring all the writ petitions to any one High Court in the present matter also.
15.
The fact that this Court on 03.04.1991 had dismissed the Transfer Petition Nos.614615 of 1990 observing that the concerned High Courts may dispose of the writ petition on early date cannot be treated any kind of bar in transferring the writ petition in the present batch of cases.
At the time when the earlier transfer petition was dismissed, conflicting judgments on subject in issue by different High Courts had not come.
As noted above, with respect to the cap on the number of audits, there are conflicting judgments of different High Courts taking different views on the similar guidelines.
Further, this Courts judgment in Institute of Chartered Accountants of India versus Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation Limited and another (supra), transferring the writ petition to one High Court i.e. Calcutta High Court does not preclude the consideration of prayer of the petitioner for transferring the writ petitions to this Court in present matter.
16.
The guidelines which are impugned in the High Court and consequent disciplinary proceedings initiated against various chartered accountants throughout the country is an issue of public importance affecting Chartered Accountants as well as the citizens who have to obtain compulsory tax audits.
We are satisfied that to settle the law and to clear the uncertainty among tax professionals and citizens, it is appropriate that this Court may transfer the writ petition, to authoritatively pronounce the law on the subject.
17.
We, however, find substance in the submissions made by learned counsel for the respondentswrit petitioners that the interim orders operating in different writ petitions which are sought to be transferred should be allowed to be continued till this Court considers the matter and passes any other order.
18.
In result, these Transfer Petitions are allowed.
The writ petitions mentioned above are withdrawn to this Court.
19.
The Registry should transmit this order to the respective High Courts immediately.
The interim orders passed in the writ petitions which are being transferred to this Court shall continue till any other order is passed by this Court.
