While issuing notice in this appeal on 05.04.2019 following order was passed by this Court Issue notice.
Till the next date the warden, who is as on date looking to the affairs of the hostel, shall continue.
12.
We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel appearing for the respondents.
13. Learned counsel for the appellant submits that appointing authority of Warden of the College Hostel is the Governing Body of the College.
The appointment of respondent No.1 was directly made by the Principal respondent No.3 on 06.05.2016 without approval of the Governing Body which was an illegal appointment.
Learned counsel submits that both learned Single Judge and Division Bench having found the appointment of respondent No.1 illegal, the appointment made by the Governing Body in pursuance of judgment of the learned Single Judge ought to have been maintained.
There was no occasion for directing fresh appointment as has been directed by the learned Division Bench of the High Court.
It is submitted that Delhi University vide its letter dated 23.10.2013 and letter dated 02.08.2016 had clarified that the appointment of Warden and Matron in College Hostel is purely an administrative affair of the College and the University of Delhi has no role to play in this regard.
It is submitted that Ordinance XVIII, 6A(5) (b)(iii) does not confer any authority to Staff Council to appoint a Warden of the Hostel of the College.
It is further submitted that the letter of the University Grants Commission dated 19.02.1987 does not confer any authority on the Principal to make appointment of Warden of the Hostel of the College.
It is submitted that the learned Division Bench has issued various directions which encroach on the right of the Governing Body to exercise its jurisdiction of the appointing authority of the Warden of the Hostel of the College.
14.
Learned counsel appearing for respondent No.3 submits that Daulat Ram College is affiliated to the University of Delhi and 95 grants is funded from 19.02.1987 was written by the University Grants Commission in response to the letter of the Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi and said letter was ratified by the Executive Council of the University in its meeting dated 25.04.1987 that it is the Principal, who is the appointing authority of the Warden of the Hostel of the College.
The Principal, being the administrative head of the College, is entitled to make appointment.
It is also submitted that Staff Council also has no role in the appointment of Warden which is in the domain of the Principal of the College.
15.
Learned counsel appearing for respondent No.1 has adopted the submissions made by the learned counsel for respondent No.3.
It is submitted that after judgment of the Division Bench, Staff Council in its meeting dated 01.04.2019 has recommended respondent No.1 for appointment as the Warden of the Hostel of the College, there is no power in the Chairperson of the Governing Body to appoint any one of her choice as Warden of the Hostel of the College.
16.
On behalf of respondent No.2, it has been submitted that the appointment of an existing teaching staff in an honorary capacity as Warden of a College Hostel is not specifically provided for under any of the provisions of University of Delhi Act, 1922, Statutes, and Ordinance.
It is submitted that all Colleges which are affiliated to or constituent of University of Delhi follow the practice of inviting applications from interested teachers of their respective Colleges by putting up a notice by the Principal of the College and thereafter Principal recommends shortlist the name for appointment whereafter the Governing Body grants approval and the procedure for appointment takes thereafter.
17.
We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the records.
18.
Only two questions arise for consideration in this appeal (1) Whether it is the Principal of the College who is empowered to appoint Warden of the Hostel of the College or it is the Governing Body in whom the power to appoint Warden is vested ?, and (2) what is the procedure to be adopted before making appointment of Warden of the College Hostel ?
19.
Both the questions being interrelated are being taken together.
20.
The claim of the Principal as well as respondent No.1 that it is the Principal who is the appointing authority of Warden of the College Hostel is based on letter of the University Grants Commission dated 19.02.1987.
The letter dated 19.02.1987 was written by the Secretary of University Grants Commission to the ViceChancellor of the Delhi University regarding revising the existing staffing pattern in the Hostels of the Colleges affiliated to Delhi University.
The above letter has been brought on record as Annexure P2.
It is useful to extract the entire letter which is to the following effect UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION BAHADURSHAH ZAFAR MARG NEW DELHI D.O.NO.F.14/B84/884(NPII) Vol.II February 19, 1987 Dear Professor Moonis Raza Kindly refer to your office DO letter
No. DC/632/87 dated 3rd February, 1987 regarding revising the existing staffing pattern in the hostels of colleges affiliated to Delhi University in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee appointed by the University.
The proposal has been considered in the light of the information earlier furnished by the University vide letter No.DSW/85/9391
dated 17th October, 1985 which was required to streamline the rules about fees charged and facilities provided in the hostels of the central universities.
We find that there is a need to revise the staffing pattern in the hostel mess staff which was fixed as far back as in 1971.
Though the Warden has been desired to be provided for the womens hostels, it is felt that each hostel should have a warden who should be responsible for all hostel administration in the college and he she should be appointed by the Principal from amongst senior teachers in the college.
As an incentive for this extra work an allowance of Rs.300/ pm be paid.
In order to have the accounts of the hostel up to date and in perfect order a need for providing a clerk is also felt as a necessity.
Since some of the hostels are also having the services of Chowkidar Mali Safai Karamchari to be left categories provided the total staff in Group D for hostel mess staff does not exceed the prescribed limit of additional four.
In view of the above the commission agrees to provide the following additional staff for the smooth functioning of the hostel activities 1.Warden (One) To be paid Rs.30/ per month 2.Clerk (One)
In the scale of pay of Rs.950 1500.
3.Ground D employees In the scale of pay of Rs.(four)in the category 750 940.
of Chowkidar Mali Safai Karamchari
The provision of the above staff will be effective from 1st January, 1987 and the pattern of funding will be the same as for the payment of maintenance grant to Delhi Colleges i.e. 100 95 as the case may be.
You are requested to bring this decision to the notice of the concerned colleges having hostel facilities with a request that they should send 2 separate statements of accounts in respect of staff working in the hostels on the existing pattern and on the basis of the revised pattern with the accounts of the college for the year 198687.
With regards, Yours sincerely, (S.P. Gupta) Prof. Moonis Raza, ViceChancellor, University of Delhi.
21.
The emphasis has been laid by the counsel for respondent No.2University of Delhi on the following sentence occurring in the letter it is felt that each hostel should have a warden who should be responsible for all hostel administration in the college and he she should be appointed by the Principal from amongst senior teachers in the college.
22.
The letter of the Secretary dated 19.02.1987 communicates the decision of the Commission.
The last portion of the letter incorporates decision of the Commission beginning with the word In view of the above the commission agrees to provide the following additional staff for the smooth functioning of the hostel activities 1.Warden (One) To be paid Rs.30/ per month 23.
A careful reading of the aforesaid letter indicates that the decision of the Commission which was communicated by the Secretary was the decision of the University Grants Commission to provide additional staff for smooth functioning of the Hostel of the College.
The Commission neither took decision regarding appointment of the Warden nor such decision was communicated by the said letter.
24.
It is further submitted that the above decision of the University Grants Commission dated 19.02.1987 has been ratified by the Executive Council of the Delhi University vide its minutes dated 25.04.1987.
In the counteraffidavit filed by respondent No.3 the minutes of the Executive Council dated 25.04.1987 are filed in which proceeding, Item No.15, the letter of the University Grants Commission dated 19.02.1987 has been referred to and the decision taken by the Executive Commission was recorded.
The relevant minutes of the proceeding of Item No.15 is as follows 15.
Resolved that receipt of the following letters from the University Grants Commission and the Government of India and the action taken thereon wherever necessary be recorded Letters from the U.G.C. Letter No.
Date Subject 1. 2. 3. 4. F.I4/84(NPII)
Conveying the Commissions Vol.II, dated 19.2.1987 approval to(i)
raising the funding pattern of Salaries of Hostel, employees from 75 to 95 (100 in case of University maintained institu tions) subject to the condition that the remaining 5 of the expenditure may be made by the Management as in the case of College administration with no financial burden, whatsoever, on the students residing in the Hostels.
(ii) Sanction for a few additional posts for smooth functioning of Hostel activities.
25.
A perusal of the above minutes of the Executive Council of the Delhi University indicates that what Executive Council noticed in the minutes is that the Commission has approved the raising of the funding pattern of salaries of the employees of the Hostel from 75 to 95 and the remaining 5 of the expenditure was to be made by the Management as in the case of College administration with no financial burden on the students residing in the Hostels.
Only to the extent of the above part of the decision of the Commission the Executive Council reiterated and there was no decision by the University that appointment of Warden of the Hostel is to be made by the Principal of the College.
26.
The University has filed counteraffidavit in the writ petition before the High Court where it has categorically taken the stand that the University Act, Statutes and Ordinance do not provide for appointment of the Warden of the Hostel College and it is a private matter concerning the respective college.
In the LPA affidavit was called for and the affidavit dated 11.01.2019 by Prof. T.K. Das, Registrar, University of Delhi was filed.
In paragraph 5 of the said affidavit following has been stated 5.
The appointment of an existing teaching staff in an honorary capacity as Warden of a college is not specifically provided for under any of the provisions of University of Delhi Act, 1922 statutes, and Ordinance being a private matter concerning the respective college and University of Delhi has no role to play.
However, all the collages, which have their own hostel and, are affiliated or constituted of University of Delhi follow the practice of inviting applications from interested teachers of their respective college by putting up notice by the Principal of said College, willing to take on this honorary charge.
Then the Principal of the respective college considers such application received and recommends shortlist the name for such appointment.
Thereafter, the name of shortlisted teacher and appointed to the honorary post of warden is placed before the Governing Body for approval.
27.
Two earlier letters dated 21.10.2013 and 13.06.2016 which have been brought on record as AnnexureP7 and AnnexureP23 have also communicated that appointment of Warden in the College Hostel is purely an administrative affair of the College and the University has no role to play in this behalf.
28.
In view of the aforesaid, letter dated 19.02.1987 issued by the University Grants Commission cannot be read to mean that it is Principal who is the appointing authority of the Warden of the Hostel of the College.
29.
Learned single Judge in its judgment dated 19.08.2016 has rightly held that University Grants Commissions letter dated 19.02.1987 is of no avail.
26.
Much emphasis has been laid by the learned counsel for the respondent on Ordinance XVIII which deals with Of Colleges and Halls.
Ordinance XVIII, 6A deals with Staff Council.
6A relevant for the present case is quoted hereunder 6A. (1) There shall be a Staff Council in every College.
(2) All the members of the teaching staff, the Librarian and the Director of Physical Education shall constitute the Staff Council.
(3) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Principal shall act as PrincipalinCouncil in respect of matters on which Staff Council is required to take decisions.
ORDINANCE XVIII (4) (a)
The Principal shall be exofficio Chairman of the Staff Council.
(b) The Council shall elect its Secretary, who shall hold office for a term of one year.
The Secretary may be reelected for a second term but no person shall hold office of Secretary for more than two consecutive terms.
(5) (a) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council shall take decisions in respect of the following matters (i) Preparation of College timetable.
(ii) Allocation of extracurricular work of teachers not involving, payment of remuneration.
(iii) Organising extracurricular activities, including cultural activities of students, sports, games, National Service Scheme and other social services schemes and academic societies.
(iv) Laying down guidelines for purchase of library books and laboratory equipment in consultation with the appropriate departments.
(v) Organising admission of students.
(b) Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council shall make recommendations in respect of the following matters (i) Formulation of recommendations on introduction of new teaching posts in the departments and expansion of the existing departments (ii) Formulation of admission policy within the framework of the policy laid down by the University (iii) Formulation of guidelines regarding arrangements for the residence and welfare of students in consultation with appropriate students organisations (iv) Formulation of guidelines regarding discipline of the students (v) Formulation of policies for recommending names of teachers for participation in seminars and conferences and financial assistance to teachers.
Note The administrative staff of the College will not be within the purview of the Staff Council.
30.
The reliance has been placed on 6A(5)(b)(iii), formulation of guidelines regarding arrangements for the residence and welfare of students in consultation with appropriate students organisations.
When we read the Ordinance 6A which deals with the Staff Council of every College, clause (5)(a) provides that subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council has to take decisions in respect of the matters enumerated therein.
There is reliance only on clause (5)(b)(iii) which is extracted above.
Clause (5)(b) provides that subject to the provisions of the Act, the Statutes and the Ordinances of the University, the Staff Council shall make recommendations in respect of the matters mentioned therein.
Formulation of guidelines regarding arrangements for the residence and welfare of students in consultation with appropriate students organisations, in no manner can embrace in it the power to make appointment of Warden.
It has been clearly stated by the University in its letters and affidavit that it is a matter of administration of the College and is not dealt in the Act, Statutes and Ordinances.
Had the Ordinance 6A(5)(b)(iii) contemplated recommendation of Staff Council for appointment of Warden, the University could have very well taken that stand which stand has not been taken in the present proceedings.
31.
The Delhi University has also filed a counter affidavit in the proceedings before this Court.
In the counteraffidavit filed by the University of Delhi in these proceedings, the stand of University of Delhi has again been taken in paragraph 4 which is to the following effect 4.
The appointment of Warden of the hostel maintained by the College constituent affiliated to the University of Delhi is purely an administrative affair of the College and the University has no role to play in this behalf.
It is respectfully submitted that the appointment of an existing teaching staff in an honorary capacity as Warden of a college is not specifically provided for under any of the provisions of the University of Delhi Act, 1922 Statutes, and Ordinances.
However all the Colleges, which have their own Hostel and, are affiliated or constituent of University of Delhi, follow the practice of inviting application from interested teachers of their respective College by putting up notice by the Principal of said College, willing to take up the honorary charge.
Then the Principal of the respective College considers such application received and recommends shortlist the name for such appointment.
Thereafter, the name of the shortlisted teacher to be appointed to the honorary post of Warden is placed before the Governing Body of the said college for approval.
This practice has been in vogue, more or the less in the light of the letter of UGC dated 19.02.1987 (Annexure P2 herein).
The Hindu college for instance also follows the same practice.
32.
In the counteraffidavit of the University referring to practice, the University clearly states that appointment of Warden is purely an administrative affair of the College and the University has no role to play and further the same is not provided for under any of the provisions of the University of Delhi Act, Statutes and Ordinances.
We, thus, come to the conclusion that Ordinance XVIII 6A(5)(b)(iii) does not empower the Staff Council to make any recommendation with regard to the appointment of Warden of the College Hostel.
33.
The Governing Body of the College is to administer the affair of the College.
Ordinance XVIII Chapter VII2 at page 47 of the paper book is to the following effect 2.
The Governing Body will meet at least once in a term, and, subject as hereinafter provided, shall have general supervision and control of the affairs of the College and maintain its own records of its proceedings which shall be open to inspection by the inspection authority.
34.
The Governing Body, thus, has general supervision of the College.
Even in the Colleges and Institutions which are maintained by the University, it is provided in Ordinance XX that the Governing Body which is constituted by the Executive Council is empowered to appoint the administrative staff of the College.
Similarly, the Governing Body of the affiliated Colleges is empowered to appoint administrative staff of the College.
The Ordinance does not empower the Principal to make any appointment of the Warden of the Hostel nor any other statutory provision has been referred which empowers the Principal to appoint Warden of the College.
35.
The Principal, however, who is entrusted the over all internal administration of the College is a person who knows all the staff of the College and his her recommendation with regard to appointment of Warden of the College Hostel is to carry weight.
The Governing Body while making appointment of Warden of the College Hostel has to give due weight to the recommendation of Principal.
The appointment of Warden of the Hostel is made from amongst the permanent staff of the College, the practice which is followed in the College and with which there is no dispute between the parties is that the applications are invited through notice by Principal for appointment of Warden and after recommendation is made by the Principal, a decision is taken by the Governing Body is to appoint Warden.
36.
With regard to the role of Staff Council in the appointment of Warden of the Hostel, we have already observed that Ordinances do not empower the Staff Council to make any recommendation with regard to the appointment of Warden.
We have found that the Principal has no authority to appoint Dr. Asha respondent No.1 as Warden in the Hostel of the College and appointment made by the Principal was irregular.
The Division Bench also did not interfere with the judgment of the learned Single Judge.
The Division Bench in the directions in paragraph 41 has directed that the applications received in response to notice for appointment of Warden to be placed before the Staff Council which was to take a decision and make recommendations on the said applications.
We having found that Staff Council is not statutorily empowered to make any recommendation regarding appointment of Warden of the College Hostel, the direction of the Division Bench requiring placement of all applications before the Staff Council was uncalled for.
The appointment of Warden of the Hostel being in the domain of the Governing Body, the High Court should have left it to the Governing Body to take appropriate steps along with the Principal of the College for making appointment of the Warden of the Hostel of the College.
We, thus, are of the view that directions in paragraph 41 of the Division Bench judgment cannot be sustained and are hereby set aside.
37.
The High Court has also appointed two Advocates as Commissioners to visit the Hostel premises.
The Commissioners visited the Hostel and submitted report to the High Court.
No further directions are needed in the above reference.
38.
Respondent No.4 in its counteraffidavit has stated that in pursuance of direction of the learned Single Judge, respondent No.4 was appointed by the Governing Body as Warden of the Hostel of the College whereas respondent No.1 claims that respondent No.1 has been appointed as Warden in pursuance of notice issued by the Principal on 08.03.2019.
The appointment of respondent No.4 as Warden which was made subsequent to the judgment of the learned Single Judge by the Governing Body on 07.04.2018, the tenure of which has come to end.
The initial appointment of respondent No.1 on 06.05.2016 as well as subsequent appointment as claimed by respondent No.1 cannot be held to be valid.
39.
The dispute which ensued regarding the appointment of Warden of the College Hostel arose due to the fact that position regarding procedure and right to make appointment on the post of Warden was not clear and the claim was raised by the Principal on the strength of letter of the University Grants Commission dated 19.02.1987 which we have dealt as above.
From the discussion as above, it is clear that it is the Governing Body of the College which has the authority to appoint Warden of the College Hostel.
However, the Principal being Executive head of the entire College and being in position to know the members of the staff as per prevailing practice the applications are to be invited through the Principal of the College and after receipt of the applications the applications along with recommendation of the Principal may be placed before the Governing Body which is to take decision regarding appointment of the Warden of the Hostel of the College.
40.
The affidavit has also been filed on behalf of the respondent No.3 that Hostel of the College is closed since June 2019 which has not yet been opened.
An affidavit has also been filed by the appellant stating that Schools and Colleges were closed under the orders issued by the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs and it has to be opened in the fair manner.
The appellant submits that Schools, Colleges and Hostels cannot be opened as of now.
