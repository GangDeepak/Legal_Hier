2.5 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court dismissing the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and consequently confirming the award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, the original respondentsState and others have preferred the present special leave petition.
3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners has vehemently submitted that the High Court has materially erred in dismissing the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act and has materially erred in not properly appreciating the fact that the arbitral award was passed contrary to the materials on record.
3.1
It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners that the High Court has materially erred in not properly considering that the suspension under the agreement was not the suspension of work per se, rather was suspension of all payments to the consultants and therefore there was no question of dilution gobye of the suspension letter.
It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners that the High Court has not properly appreciated considered the scheme of the contract.
It is submitted that in case of nonperformance of the contract satisfactorily, the first step was suspension of payment and if the failure in performance is not remedied, then the consequence which follows is the next step that being notice of termination by issuing 30 days notice.
It is submitted that suspension is either operative or revoked by resuming the payments, for, suspension is suspension of payment and not suspension of work contract.
It is submitted that therefore the High Court has materially erred in confirming the findings recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal that the termination of the contract was illegal and without following due procedure as required under the contract.
4.
While opposing the present special leave petition, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondentsoriginal claimants has vehemently submitted that, as such, there are concurrent findings of fact recorded by all the Courts below on the illegal termination of the contract.
It is submitted that, on appreciation of evidence, the learned Arbitral Tribunal (in paragraphs 17 to 36) gave the specific findings by giving cogent reasons that the termination of the contract was illegal and without following due procedure as required under the contract.
It is submitted that once the findings recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal are on appreciation of evidence and considering the materials on record, the same is rightly not interfered with by the Courts below in the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act.
4.1 Making the above submissions and relying upon the decisions of this Court in the cases of Associate Builders v. DDA (2015) 3 SCC 49 , NHAI v. ProgressiveMVR (2018) 14 SCC 688 and Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. v. Datar Switchgear Ltd. (2018) 3 SCC 133 , it is prayed to dismiss the present special leave petition.
5.
Heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective parties at length.
6.
The main controversy is with respect to the termination of the contract vide letter communication dated 09.2.2012 terminating the contract with effect from 12.03.2012 invoking Clause 2.9.1(1) and (d) of the GCC.
That, on appreciation of evidence and considering the various clauses of the contract, the learned Arbitral Tribunal has observed and held by giving cogent reasons that the termination of the contract was illegal and contrary to the terms of the contract and without following due procedure as required under the relevant clauses of the contract.
The said finding of fact recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal is on appreciation of evidence.
The said finding of fact has been confirmed in the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act.
Thus, there are concurrent findings of fact recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, First Appellate Court and the High Court that the termination of the contract was illegal and without following due procedure as required under the relevant provisions of the contract.
6.1
In the case of ProgressiveMVR (supra), after considering the catena of decisions of this Court on the scope and ambit of the proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, this Court has observed and held that even when the view taken by the arbitrator is a plausible view, and or when two views are possible, a particular view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal which is also reasonable should not be interfered with in a proceeding under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
6.2 In the case of Datar Switchgear Ltd. (supra), this Court has observed and held that the Arbitral Tribunal is the master of evidence and the findings of fact which are arrived at by the arbitrators on the basis of the evidence on record are not to be scrutinized as if the Court was sitting in appeal.
In para 51 of the judgment, it is observed and held as under 51 Categorical findings are arrived at by the Arbitral Tribunal to the effect that insofar as Respondent 2 is concerned, it was always ready and willing to perform its contractual obligations, but was prevented by the appellant from such performance.
Another specific finding which is returned by the Arbitral Tribunal is that the appellant had not given the list of locations and, therefore, its submission that Respondent 2 had adequate lists of locations available but still failed to install the contract objects was not acceptable.
In fact, on this count, the Arbitral Tribunal has commented upon the working of the appellant itself and expressed its dismay about lack of control by the Head Office of the appellant over the field offices which led to the failure of the contract.
These are findings of facts which are arrived at by the Arbitral Tribunal after appreciating the evidence and documents on record.
From these findings it stands established that there is a fundamental breach on the part of the appellant in carrying out its obligations, with no fault of Respondent 2 which had invested whopping amount of Rs 163 crores in the project.
A perusal of the award reveals that the Tribunal investigated the conduct of the entire transaction between the parties pertaining to the work order, including withholding of DTC locations, allegations and counterallegations by the parties concerning installed objects.
The arbitrators did not focus on a particular breach qua particular number of objects class of objects.
Respondent 2 is right in its submission that the fundamental breach, by its very nature, pervades the entire contract and once committed, the contract as a whole stands abrogated.
It is on the aforesaid basis that the Arbitral Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the termination of contract by Respondent 2 was in order and valid.
The proposition of law that the Arbitral Tribunal is the master of evidence and the findings of fact which are arrived at by the arbitrators on the basis of evidence on record are not to be scrutinised as if the Court was sitting in appeal now stands settled by a catena of judgments pronounced by this Court without any exception thereto See Associate Builders v. DDA, (2015) 3 SCC 49 (2015) 2 SCC (Civ) 204 and S. Munishamappa v. B. Venkatarayappa, (1981) 3 SCC 260 .
As held by this Court in catena of decisions, the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal can be interfered with in the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 of Arbitration Act only in a case where the finding is perverse and or contrary to the evidence and or the same is against the public policy.
(see Associate Builders v. DDA (2015) 3 SCC 49 etc.)
6.3
In the present case, the categorical findings arrived at by the Arbitral Tribunal are to the effect that the termination of the contract was illegal and without following due procedure of the provisions of the contract.
The findings are on appreciation of evidence considering the relevant provisions and material on record as well as on interpretation of the relevant provisions of the contract, which are neither perverse nor contrary to the evidence in record.
Therefore, as such, the First Appellate Court and the High Court have rightly not interfered with such findings of fact recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal.
6.4
Once it is held that the termination was illegal and thereafter when the learned Arbitral Tribunal has considered the claims on merits, which basically were with respect to the unpaid amount in respect of the work executed under the contract and loss of profit.
Cogent reasons have been given by the learned Arbitral Tribunal while allowing partly allowing the respective claims.
It is required to be noted that the learned Arbitral Tribunal has partly allowed some of the claims and even disallowed also some of the claims.
There is a proper application of mind by the learned Arbitral Tribunal on the respective claims.
Therefore, the same is not required to be interfered with, more particularly, when in the proceedings under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act, the petitioners have failed.
7.
Once the finding recorded by the learned Arbitral Tribunal that the termination of the contract was illegal is upheld and the claims made by the claimants have been allowed or allowed partly, in that case, the counterclaim submitted by the petitioners was liable to be rejected and the same is rightly rejected.
No interference of this Court is called for.
8.
In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present special leave petition deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed.
However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
