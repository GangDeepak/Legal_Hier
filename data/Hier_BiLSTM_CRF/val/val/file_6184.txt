 Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J 1.
The jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution has been invoked by MBBS graduate doctors who have appeared for the NEET PG 2021 and have participated in the ongoing counselling process for 2021 2022.
Their grievance pertains to the schedule which has been prescribed by the National Board of Examinations (NBE) for holding the NEETPG 2022 examination.
The NBE issued a notification on 4 February 2022 by which it scheduled the NEETPG 2022 examination on 21 May 2022.
The petitioners seek the issuance of a direction for (i)
Quashing the notification dated 4 February 2022 issued by the NBE (ii) Postponement of the NEETPG 2022 examination (iii) Notification of a fresh date for the examination after a period of eight weeks so that in the meantime the issue of counselling for the NEETPG 2021 examination gets resolved and there is no overlap of the former with the NEETPG 2022 examination and (iv) A direction to the respondents to permit students who have participated in the counselling for the NEETPG 2021 examination to register for the NEETPG 2022 examination by extending the last date for registration which was 25 March 2022.

In view of the urgency of the issue, it has been taken up for final disposal on the basis of the submissions which have been placed on the record by counsel appearing on either side.
4.
The NEETPG examination for 20222023 is due to be held on 21 May 2022.
Registration for the ensuing examination was closed on 25 March 2022.
The grievance of the petitioners is that they have not been allowed a fair opportunity to participate, which violates their fundamental rights particularly under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
The following tabulation has been placed on the record to highlight the nature of the grievance NEET PG 2021 ORIGINAL SCHEDULE NEET PG 2021 ACTUAL COURSE OF EVENTS NEET PG 2022 SCHEDULE Exam Date 11th

The second column of the above chart indicates the course of events in the NEETPG 2021 entrance examination.
The first round of counselling took place between 12 and 22 January 2022.
The second round took place between 3 February to 12 February 2022 and was extended up to 18 February 2022.
Thereafter, mop up stray rounds have taken place up to 7 May 2022.
The States are holding their counselling sessions till 12 May 2022.
The NEETPG 2022 examination was originally scheduled for 12 March 2022 but was postponed due to a clash with the counselling dates for NEETPG 2021.
This was noticed in a judgment of this Court in Shivam Satyarthee and Others vs Union of India and Others 2022 SCS Online SC 492 .
In paragraph 4 of the judgment, this Court observed One of the grounds on which the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution was instituted was that there was a likely clash between the schedule of counselling for NEETPG 202122 and the NEETPG examination for the ensuing academic year.
This aspect of the matter has now been resolved as a result of the postponement of the NEETPG examination.
6.
The new date for NEETPG 2022 has been fixed as 21 May 2022.
The results for the examination are expected on 20 June 2022.
Senior counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners urged that the petitioners are doctors who have rendered COVID duties in the past two years and were participating in the counselling process following the NEETPG 2021 entrance examination and that process was to end on 12 May 2022.
However, the stray round of counselling is yet to take place.
It has been submitted that an extension of about two months may be granted for conducting the NEETPG 2022 for the ensuing academic year.
Counsel submitted that representations have been made by the doctors similarly circumstanced and if an extension is granted, this would cause no prejudice to the Union Government while at the same time would provide the petitioners and similarly placed candidates as well as those doctors who have registered, additional time to study for the ensuing examination.
7.
Mr P Wilson, senior counsel has placed reliance on a public notice dated 5 May 2022 issued by the National Medical Commission (NMC) which intimated all medical colleges and institutes that the last date for filling information relating to admissions made for Post Graduate (Broad and Super Specialty courses) for 20212022 on the NMC portal was extended to 9 May 2022.
8.
Ms Aishwarya Bhati, Additional Solicitor General has while opposing the submissions urged that (i) The issue as to whether the NEETPG 2022 entrance examination was to be postponed was a matter of serious deliberation in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
A conscious decision was taken on 10 May 2021 against postponing the examination for reasons bearing on public interest and the needs of medical education (ii) Any delay in conducting the NEETPG 2022 examination would impact the patient care since this would lead to a fewer number of resident doctors in hospitals.
There are supposed to be three batches of doctors who are studying for PG courses and are available for patient care and treatment in medical college hospitals.
However, only two batches are currently available because of the delay in conducting the examination and any further postponement will be have a cascading effect on patient care, treatment and other ancillary matters (iii)
The number of doctors who have registered for NEETPG between the period 20192020 and 20222023 is indicated in the following table Academic Year No. of Registered Doctors 201920 148713 202021 167102 202122 177415 202223 206541 (iv) The NEETPG 20222023 examination is scheduled to be held in January 2023.
Adhering to the current schedule for the NEETPG 2022 will allow the Union Government to put the schedule back on track which was disturbed thus far due to the onset of the Covid19 pandemic.
(v) The schedule has to be consistent with the order of this Court in Dr Ashish Ranjan and Others vs Union of India and Others (Writ Petition (Civil)
No 76 of 2015 dated 18.01.2016).
In Dr Ashish Ranjan (supra), the National Medical Commission (NMC) moved this Court for its approval of the time schedule for NEETPG, which was granted on 9 May 2022 and (vi) The Public Notice of the NMC dated 5 May 2022 did not extend the time for completing admissions and as a matter of fact, admissions have been closed on 7 May 2022.
9.
While considering the rival submissions, it must be noted at the outset that the academic session has been delayed by a period of four months when compared with the schedule which has been prescribed by this Court by its order dated 18 January 2016 in Dr Ashish Ranjan (supra).
The schedule which has been prescribed by the order of this Court is tabulated below Time Schedule for completion of Admission Process for PG (Broad Specialty) Medical Courses for All India Quota and State Quota S.

May 2022 Declaration of Result By 20th June 2022 12.
The petitioners and other similarly placed doctors have participated in the counseling process for NEETPG 2021.
They were not barred from registering for NEETPG 2022.
The registration for NEETPG 2022 for the ensuing year had closed on 25 March 2022.
As many as 2,06,541 doctors have registered for the ensuing examination.
The submission of the petitioners that a postponement of the examination will cause no prejudice to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is specious.
It must be borne in mind is that there is a large number of student  doctors who have registered for the entrance test.
Over two lakh students have registered for the ensuing examination and their schedule would be seriously affected if a further postponement is granted under a direction of this Court.
Postponement of exams results in chaos and uncertainty.
During the onslaught of the Covid waves, postponements may have been granted by the administering authorities since we were confronted with an unprecedented human crisis.
This should not become the norm.
Doing so will disturb the sanctity of medical education.
As the country gets back on the rails after the dislocation which was caused due to the Covid19 pandemic, it is necessary that the decision which has been taken by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of adhering to the time schedule must be accepted.
An important consideration which has weighed in the decision not to postpone the NEETPG 2022 examination is that any delay in conducting the examination will lead to a fewer number of resident doctors in hospitals.
Currently, only two batches of resident doctors are available because of the delay in holding the NEETPG examination, resulting in serious deficiency in the required strength of doctors in hospitals.
This impacts patient care and results in backbreaking loads of work for the existing doctors.
Their quality of life, dignity and wellbeing are also of concern.
13.
In this backdrop, while the request which has been made by the petitioners for a further postponement of the NEETPG examination may seem innocuous from their perspective, it cannot be entertained for the reason that this would seriously impact the availability of patient care and qualified postgraduate doctors.
It is likely to have a cascading effect on patient care and on the careers of those doctors who have already registered in large numbers for the ensuing examination.
14.
The concern of the petitioners who have participated in the counselling process for NEETPG 202122 and will now have to immediately undertake the exam for NEETPG 202223 is understandable.
However, these matters essentially pertain to the policy domain.
Unless the Court is satisfied that the decision which has been taken by the authorities is without application of mind to relevant circumstances or was manifestly arbitrary, there would no reason for the Court to interfere.
Postponement of any examination is replete with serious consequences.
While one body of the students may be interested in seeking a postponement, there will be a large number of other students who have registered for the examination.
Above all, the needs of patient care and treatment must be paramount in the clash of rival interests between those doctors who have registered for the ensuing examination and those who have not registered.
Balancing of priorities in administration is a difficult task.
The task is entrusted to the executive and not to courts.
Hence, in our considered view, the reliefs which have been sought in these proceedings cannot be granted.
15.
The petition shall accordingly stand dismissed.
