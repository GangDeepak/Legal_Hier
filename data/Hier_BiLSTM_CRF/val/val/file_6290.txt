4.1

4.10 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeals.
5. Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.
6.
At the outset, it is required to be noted that the respective Market Committees are claiming exemption under the 2006 circular.
The exemption circular issued by the Board reads as under Circular No.89/7 /2006 dated 18.12.2006
A number of sovereign public authorities (i.e., an agency constituted set up by Government) perform certain functions duties, which are statutory in nature.
These functions are performed in terms of specific responsibility assigned to them under the law in force.
For examples, the Regional Reference Standards Laboratories (RRSL) undertake verification, approval and calibration of weighing and measuring instruments the Regional Transport Officer (RTO) issues fitness certificate to the vehicles the Directorate of Boilers inspects and issues certificate for boilers or Explosive Department inspects and issues certificate for petroleum storage tank, LPG CNG tank in terms of provisions of the relevant lows.
Fee as prescribed is charged and the same is ultimately deposited into the Government Treasury.
A doubt has arisen whether such activities provided by a sovereign public authority required to be provided under a statute can be considered as provision of service for the purpose of levy of service tax.
2.
The issue has been examined.
The Board is of the view that the activities performed by the sovereign public authorities under the provision of law are in the nature of statutory obligations which are to be fulfilled in accordance with law.
The fee collected by them for performing such activities is in the nature of compulsory levy as per the provision of the relevant statute, and it is deposited into the Government treasury.
Such activity is purely in public interest and it is undertaken as mandatory and statutory function.
These are not in the nature of service to any particular individual for any consideration.
Therefore, such an activity performed by a sovereign public authority under the provisions of law does not constitute provision of taxable service to a person and, therefore, no service.
tax is leviable on such activities 3.
However, if such authority performs a service, which is not in the nature of statutory activity and the same is undertaken for consideration not in the nature of statutory fee levy, then in such cases, service tax would be leviable, if the activity undertaken falls within the ambit of a taxable service.
7.
As per the exemption circular only such activities performed by the sovereign public authorities under the provisions of law being mandatory and statutory functions and the fee collected for performing such activities is in the nature of a compulsory levy as per the provisions of the relevant statute and it is deposited into the Government Treasury, no service tax is leviable on such activities.
In paragraph 3, it is also specifically clarified that if such authority performs a service, which is not in the nature of a statutory activity and the same is undertaken for consideration, then in such cases, service tax would be leviable, if the activity undertaken falls within the ambit of a taxable service.
Thus, the language used in the 2006 circular is clear, unambiguous and is capable of determining a defined meaning.
8.
The exemption notification should not be liberally construed and beneficiary must fall within the ambit of the exemption and fulfill the conditions thereof.
In case such conditions are not fulfilled, the issue of application of the notification does not arise at all by implication.
8.1
It is settled law that the notification has to be read as a whole.
If any of the conditions laid down in the notification is not fulfilled, the party is not entitled to the benefit of that notification.
An exception and or an exempting provision in a taxing statute should be construed strictly and it is not open to the court to ignore the conditions prescribed in the relevant policy and the exemption notifications issued in that regard.
8.2
The exemption notification should be strictly construed and given a meaning according to legislative intendment.
The Statutory provisions providing for exemption have to be interpreted in light of the words employed in them and there cannot be any addition or subtraction from the statutory provisions.
8.3
As per the law laid down by this Court in a catena of decisions, in a taxing statute, it is the plain language of the provision that has to be preferred, where language is plain and is capable of determining a defined meaning.
Strict interpretation of the provision is to be accorded to each case on hand.
Purposive interpretation can be given only when there is an ambiguity in the statutory provision or it results in absurdity, which is so not found in the present case.
8.4
Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the respondent that in the event of ambiguity in a provision in a fiscal statute, a construction favourable to the assessee should be adopted is concerned, the said principle shall not be applicable to construction of an exemption notification, when it is clear and not ambiguous.
Thus, it will be for the assessee to show that he comes within the purview of the notification.
Eligibility clause, it is well settled, in relation to exemption notification must be given effect to as per the language and not to expand its scope deviating from its language.
Thus, there is a vast difference and distinction between a charging provision in a fiscal statute and an exemption notification.
9.
In the present case, it is the case on behalf of the appellants that the activity of rent lease allotment of shop land platform space is a statutory activity and the Market Committees are performing their statutory duties cast upon them under Section 9 of the Act, 1961 and therefore they are exempted from payment of service tax on such activities.
The aforesaid submission seems to be attractive but has no substance.
Section 9(2) is an enabling provision and the words used is market committee may.
It is to be noted that in so far as subsection (1) of Section 9 is concerned, the word used is shall.
Therefore, wherever the legislature intended that the particular activity is a mandatory statutory, the legislature has used the word shall.
Therefore, when under subsection (2) of Section 9, the word used is may, the activities mentioned in Section 9(2)(xvii) cannot be said to be mandatory statutory duty and or activity.
Under Section 9(2), it is not a mandatory statutory duty cast upon the Market Committees to allot lease rent the shop platform land space to the traders.
Hence, such an activity cannot be said to be a mandatory statutory activity as contended on behalf of the appellants.
Even the fees which is collected is not deposited into the Government Treasury.
It will go to the Market Committee Fund and will be used by the market committee(s).
In the facts of the case on hand, such a fee collected cannot have the characteristics of the statutory levy statutory fee.
Thus, under the Act, 1961, it cannot be said to be a mandatory statutory obligation of the Market Committees to provide shop land platform on rent lease.
If the statute mandates that the Market Committees have to provide the land shop platform space on rent lease then and then only it can be said to be a mandatory statutory obligation otherwise it is only a discretionary function under the statute.
If it is discretionary function, then, it cannot be said to be a mandatory statutory obligation statutory activity.
Hence, no exemption to pay service tax can be claimed.
10.
The next provision relied upon by the appellants respective Market Committees is Rule 45 of the Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Markets Rules, 1963 (hereinafter referred to as Rules, 1963), which reads as under 45.
The Market Committee fund.
All money received by the Market Committee shall be credited to the fund called the Market Committee fund.
Except where Government on application by the Market Committee or otherwise shall direct, all money paid into the Market Committee fund shall be credited at least once a week in full into Government treasury or subtreasury, or a bank duly approved for this purpose by the Director.
All balance from the fund shall be kept in such treasury or sub treasury or bank and it shall not be withdrawn upon except in accordance with these rules.
10.1
Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the appellants relying upon Rule 45 of the Rules, 1963 that the fees, which is collected shall be deposited with the Government Treasury and therefore also the Market Committees are exempted from payment of service tax is concerned, it is to be noted that on fair reading of Rule 45, the amount of fee so collected on such activities rent lease shall not go to the Government.
Rule 45 provides how the money received by the Market Committees shall be invested and or deposited.
It provides that all money received by the Market Committee shall be credited to the fund called the Market Committee Fund.
It further provides that all money paid into the Market Committee Fund shall be credited once a week in full into Government Treasury or subtreasury, or a bank duly approved for this purpose by the Director and all balance from the fund shall be kept in such treasury or subtreasury or bank and it shall not be withdrawn except in accordance with the Rules.
Therefore, it does not provide that on deposit of the money received by the Market Committees into the Government Treasury subtreasury or a bank duly approved, it ceases to be the Market Committee Fund.
It will continue to be the Market Committee Fund.
Even it is the case on behalf of the appellants that the fees collected, which will be deposited in the Market Committee Fund will be utilized by the Market Committee for expanding benefit of the Market Committee etc. 11.
Even otherwise, it is to be noted that on and after 01.07.2012, such activities carried out by the Agricultural Produce Market Committees is placed in the Negative List.
If the intention of the Revenue was to exempt such activities of the Market Committees from levy of service tax, in that case, there was no necessity for the Revenue subsequently to place such activity of the Market Committees in the Negative List.
The fact that, on and after 01.07.2012, such activity by the Market Committees is put in the Negative List, it can safely be said that under the 2006 circular, the Market Committees were not exempted from payment of service tax on such activities.
At this stage, it is required to be noted that it is not the case on behalf of the Market Committees that the activity of rent lease on shop land platform as such cannot be said to be service.
However, their only submission is that the Market Committees are exempted from levy of service tax on such service activity as provided under the 2006 circular, which as observed hereinabove has no substance.
12.
In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, all these appeals fail and the same deserve to be dismissed and are accordingly dismissed.
However, in the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall be no order as to costs.
Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
