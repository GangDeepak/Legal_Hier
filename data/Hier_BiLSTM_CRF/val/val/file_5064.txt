SLP (C) No. 15346 of 2015 (Item No. 15)3.
We are informed that despite vacation of stay in the year 2010, so far no compensation has been paid.4.
Therefore, detag this matter and post for final hearing on 12.07.2017.SLP (C) No. 15348 of 2015 (Item No.17)5.
The learned counsel for the first respondent, inviting our reference to the additional affidavit, submits that there was no stay as far as the particular land referred to in this Special Leave Petition is concerned.
The stay, that is referred to in the affidavit, is in respect of another piece of land owned by the father of the first respondent.6.
In view of the above submission, detag this matter and list on 03.05.2017.7.
The Delhi Development Authority is directed to make available a copy of the stay order which operated in respect of 5 Bighas 17 Biswas of the land belonging to the first respondent.8.
It is made clear that if the stay order is not produced by that date, it will be presumed that there is no stay and the Court will be constrained to go with the additional affidavit of the first respondent.
SLP (C) No. 25536 of 2015 (Item No.18) and SLP (C) No. 38374 of 2016 (Item No.68)9.
These are the Special Leave Petitions filed by DDA and Government of NCT of Delhi.
According to the petitioners, possession could not be taken or compensation could not be paid on account of stay granted by the courts operating in respect of the land.
However, on a pointed query, it is fairly submitted that the stay was not in respect of the land referred to in these petitions, but in respect of the adjoining land covered by the same award.10.
We are afraid, such a contention is not available to the DDA NCT.
The stay should be in respect of the particular land.11.
The learned counsel for the petitioners further submit that these are the cases of subsequent purchasers.
However, the respondents submit that the purchase was made after obtaining No Objection Certificate.
It is seen from the additional documents filed by the first respondent that the purchase was after obtaining NOC from the competent authority in terms of Section 5 of The Delhi Land (Restrictions on Transfer) Act, 1972.Arguments concluded.
Judgment reserved.
SLP (C) No. 26535 of 2015 (Item No. 20)12.
