Shri B.K. Satija, learned Advocate has appeared on behalf of the appellant herein and Shri Kanwal Chaudhary, learned Advocate has appeared on behalf of the respondent herein.
3.1 Shri B.K. Satija, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant Corporation has vehemently submitted that the High Court has materially erred in quashing and setting aside the award in exercise of its powers under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
It is submitted that while quashing and setting aside the award passed by the arbitrator, the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
3.2
It is submitted that the High Court had a very limited scope and or jurisdiction while deciding the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
3.3 It is submitted that in an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the High Court has no jurisdiction to enter into the merits of the claim awarded by the arbitrator, confirmed by the first appellate Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
3.4 It is submitted that in the present case, the High Court has decided the appeal as if the High Court was deciding the first appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court which as such is not permissible while exercising the power under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
3.5 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to allow the present appeal and quash and set aside the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.
4.
The present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri Kanwal Chaudhary, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent.
4.1
It is submitted that as such the learned arbitrator had no jurisdiction at all to pass the award as no amount was due and payable as nothing was spent on marketing activities by the appellant Corporation.
4.2
It is submitted that the composition of Arbitral Tribunal as well as the appointment of the sole arbitrator was not in accordance with clause 13 of the Contract.
It is submitted that the appointment of the sole arbitrator and his competence was challenged by the respondent, which was summarily rejected.
4.3 It is submitted that the question of jurisdiction can be raised under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act which can also be raised after the award is passed.
4.4 It is submitted that even otherwise as no amount was spent by the appellant Corporation, there was no question of any payment to the appellantCorporation.
It is submitted that on the contrary, the respondent filed a counter claim claiming Rs. 13.92 lakhs which unfortunately came to be rejected by the arbitrator.
4.5 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to dismiss the present appeal.
5.
We have heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at length.
We have also gone through the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court.
6.
So far as the question of jurisdiction of the arbitrator raised by the respondent is concerned, the same has been dealt with by the High Court also and the said objection has been overruled by the High Court against which no appeal is preferred by the respondent.
In that view of the matter, now it is not open for the respondent to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, that too in an appeal preferred by the original claimant Corporation appellant herein.
7.
So far as the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court quashing and setting aside the award and the order passed by the Additional District Judge under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act are concerned, it is required to be noted that in an appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, the High Court has entered into the merits of the claim, which is not permissible in exercise of powers under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
8.
As per settled position of law laid down by this Court in a catena of decisions, an award can be set aside only if the award is against the public policy of India.
The award can be set aside under Sections 34/37 of the Arbitration Act, if the award is found to be contrary to, (a) fundamental policy of Indian Law or (b) the interest of India or (c) justice or morality or (d) if it is patently illegal.
None of the aforesaid exceptions shall be applicable to the facts of the case on hand.
The High Court has entered into the merits of the claim and has decided the appeal under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act as if the High Court was deciding the appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court.
Thus, the High Court has exercised the jurisdiction not vested in it under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.
The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is hence not sustainable.
9.
In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present appeal succeeds.
The impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court is hereby quashed and set aside.
The award passed by the arbitrator and the order passed by the Additional District Judge under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act overruling the objections are hereby restored.
10.
The present appeal is accordingly allowed to the aforesaid extent.
No costs.
