We have heard the learned Counsel for the parties, and have perused the material on record.

The Appellant has an S.S.C. Degree along with MS.
C.I.T. 6.2.Even though Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 contended that there is a ban since 2005 for appointment on compassionate grounds, a relaxation was initially granted for persons on the wait list till 31.12.2011.
Thereafter, vide Government Resolution dated 01.03.2014 bearing No. AKP1014/Pra. Kra.

On 02.04.2014, the Government released a Supplementary Order to this Resolution stating that all employment authorities shall take action every year to fill up the posts reserved for compassionate appointment upto 10 of vacant posts of Class C and D from 2012.
This reveals that the Government was continuing to make appointments on compassionate grounds despite the ban of 2005, and in fact had increased the number of posts earmarked for compassionate appointment to 10.
6.3.A perusal of the Order dated 31.05.2013 passed by the Education Officer reveals that during the hearing, Respondent No. 3 President of the Society stated that the Society was ready to appoint the Appellant on compassionate grounds, if the Education Officer grants the permission.
The Education Officer had in the proceedings dated 31.05.2013 recorded that there are 2 post of Junior Clerk vacant in the two Schools run by Respondent Nos. 3 and 4, where the Appellant could be appointed.
This fact has not been either adverted to, or considered by the High Court, in the impugned judgment.
