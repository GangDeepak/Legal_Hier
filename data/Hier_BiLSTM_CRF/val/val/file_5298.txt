2.
A Housing Scheme called The ESFERA in Sector 13C, Gurgaon, Haryana (hereinafter referred to as the Project) was launched by the Appellant sometime in 2011 and all the original Complainants booked their respective apartments by paying the booking amounts and thereafter each of them executed Builder Buyer Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement) with the Appellant.
3.
The Respondents in the leading appeal (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents) booked Apartment No.1803 on the 18th Floor of Tower No. C having super built up area 153.34 Sq. meters (1650 Sq. feet approx.)
Rs.36530.2 per Sq. meter (Rs.3395/ per Sq. foot).
The basic price was thus Rs.56,01,750/ to which additional charges such as preferential location charges for corner park facing and for higher floor as well as charges for reserve parking, club membership and development were added the aggregate price being Rs.76,43,000/. 4.
Clauses 11.1 and 11.2 of the Agreement dated 30.11.2013 entered into by the Respondents dealt with delay due to reasons beyond the control of the Developer Company and failure to deliver possession due to Government Rules, Orders, Notifications, etc. respectively.
Clause 11.4 of the Agreement was 11.4 FAILURE TO DELIVER POSSESSION REMEDY TO THE COMPANY
The intending Allottee(s) agrees that in consequence of the Developer Company abandoning the Scheme or becoming unable to give possession within three years from the date of execution of this Agreement to such extended periods as permitted under this Agreement, the Developer Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement whereupon the Developer Companys liability shall be limited to the refund of the amounts paid by the Intending Allottee(s) with simple interest 9 per annum for the period such amounts we relying with the Developer Company and to pay no other compensation whatsoever.
However, the Developer Company may, at its sole option and discretion, decide not to terminate this Agreement in which event the Developer Company agrees to pay only to the original Intending Allottee(s) and not to anyone else and only in cases other than those provided in Clauses 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 and Clause 41 and subject to the Intending Allottee(s) not being in default under any term of this Agreement, compensation Rs.5/ per sq. ft. equal to Rs.53.8/ Per Sq.
Meter of the super area of the said Apartment per month for the period of such delay beyond three half years or such extended periods as permitted under this Agreement.
The adjustment of such compensation shall be done only at the time of settling the final accounts for handing over conveyancing the said Apartment to the intending Allottee(s) first named in this Agreement and not earlier.
Clause 41 of the Agreement was as under 41.
FORCE MAJURE
The Developer Company shall not be held responsible or liable for not performing any of its obligations or undertakings provided for in this Agreement if such performance is prevented, delayed or hindered by an act of God, fire, flood, explosion, war, riot, terrorist acts, sabotage, inability to procure or general shortage of energy, labour, equipment, facilities, materials or supplies, failure of transportation, strikes, lock outs, action of labour unions or any other cause (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing) not within the reasonable control of the Developer Company.
5.
On 01.05.2016, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as, the RERA Act) came into force.
6.
Over a period of time the Respondents had paid Rs.63,53,625/ out of the agreed sum of Rs.76,43,000/. However, even after four years there were no signs of the Project getting completed.
In the circumstances Consumer Case No.3011 of 2017 was preferred by the Respondents on 11.10.2017 before the Commission submitting, inter alia, 11.
That the complainants regularly visited the site but were surprised to see that the construction was never in progress.
No one was present on the site to address the queries of the buyers allotees purchases including the present complainant.
The O.P despite taking a substantial amount towards the consideration deliberately did not construct the towers in which house of the complainant was situated.
The entire site seems to be an abandoned piece of land with semi constructed structure.
Despite a delay of many months, the construction of the apartment has not been completed.
It can hence be seen that the O.P is deficient in renderings services and after extracting most of the money from the buyers allotees purchases have deliberately stopped the construction of the houses.
12.
That it could be seen that the construction of the residential unit THE ESFERA in which the buyers allotees purchasers flats were booked many months back, with a promise by the O.P. to deliver the same within 42 months were never completed for the reasons best known to the O.P., which clearly shows the ulterior motive of the O.P. to extract money from the innocent buyers fraudulently and also demonstrates the unfair trade practices and restrictive trade practices under the ambit of consumer protection act 1986.
16.
That as per the clause 11.4 of the Buyers Agreement, it was agreed by the O.P. that in case of any delay, the O.P. shall pay to the buyers allotees purchasers, a compensation at the rate of Rs.5/ per sq. ft. per month for the period of the delay.
It could be seen here that the O.P has incorporated the Clause 11.4 in the one sided buyers agreement and has offered to pay a meagre sum of Rs.5/ per square feet for every month of delay if we calculate the amount in terms of financial charges, it comes to approximate 1.4 per annum rate of interest.
Even these charges are to be paid after 42 months of period that is taken by the O.P to construct the houses as per the buyers agreement.
This shows that the O.P. has found a cheap source of funding the commercial projects from the hard earned savings and borrowed money of innocent residential apartments house buyers like the present complainants.
The O.P is raising funds at the interest rate of mere 1.4 per annum and that too with initial 42 months of interest free duration.
30.
That the value of goods services along with compensation claimed in the present complaint is above one crore rupees hence the complainants are entitled to invoke the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Honble Commission.
The present complaint has been assessed for a sum of Rs.1,16,94,579/ and requisite fee i.e. Rs.5000/ by way of a demand draft payable to THE REGISTRAR, NCDRC New Delhi is being paid with this complaint.
Value of goods and services Rs.76,43,000/
Compensation claimed Rs.40,51,579/ 32.
In view of the above, it is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that this Honble Commission may kindly be pleaed to a. Direct the O.P. to refund the entire amount collected form the complainants towards the consideration of the Flat along with interest 18 p.a.
on the amount paid by them from the date of each deposit of the amount till it is actually returned to the complaints.
b.
Direct the O.P. to pay a sum of Rs.50,000/ (rupees fifty thousand only) to the complainants toward the cost of litigation.
c. Any other order(s) as may be deemed fit and appropriate may also kindly be passed.
The other nine Consumer Cases were also filed on the same day.

8.
In its response dated 18.01.2018 to the aforestated Consumer Case No.3011 of 2017, the Appellant challenged the jurisdiction of the Commission inter alia, on the ground that the apartment having been booked for commercial purposes, the Respondents would not come within the definition of the consumer under Section 2(d) of the CP Act.
No reference was however made to the fact that the Project had been registered under the RERA Act.
It was submitted 8.
That the contents and averments made in para 8 are wrong and denied.
It is denied that the date of possession of the unit was 30th May, 2017.
It is submitted that the respondents had clearly mentioned the schedule for possession of the said apartment Unit was based upon its present plans and estimates and subject to all just exceptions, contemplates to complete the construction of the said building said apartment within a period of three and half years for the date of execution of this agreement unless there is delay or there shall be failure due to reasons beyond the control of the company including ForceMajeure events, delay due to compliance of new rules, regulations, orders or notifications made issued by government or any other authorities with respect to construction at the project site.
11.
That the contents and averments made in Para 11 are wrong and denied.
It is pertinent to mention here that the construction of the Tower in which the Unit of the Complainant was allotted is in full Swing and is nearing possession.
The allegations levelled by the Complainant are concocted baseless.
9.
In their replication, the Respondents submitted, inter alia, the buyers agreement was a fixed set of papers, which was asked to be signed by the complainant and no modification was entertained by the O.P.
On request to change the one sided clauses, it was told that the buyers agreement has to be signed as it is and in case it is not acceptable than the allotment will stand cancelled and earnest money will be forfeited.
10.
Consumer Case No.3011 of 2017 was allowed by the Commission by its judgement and order dated 12.09.2018.
It was observed 10.
It is pertinent to note that the Developer has not filed any evidence to support his contention that the delay occurred due to force majeure events.
In fact demonetization, nonavailability of contractual labour, delay in notifying approvals cannot be construed to be force majeure events from any angle.
11. Learned Counsel for the Developer vehemently argued that the Complainants were offered alternative accommodation vide letter dated 03.04.2017 which was not accepted by them.
The said letter is reproduced as hereunder Be that as it may, in view of your allegations of delay which we deny, we hereby offer that till we complete construction of your subject matter flat
we shall arrange alternative accommodation flat for you in Group Housing Colony named Takshila Heights situated at Sector37C, Gurgaon on lease rent with immediate effect.
We will bear the rent of alternative accommodation flat at Takshila Heights.
However, you shall have to pay the common area maintenance charges and other user based charges like electricity, etc., which you would have done for your flat in Esfera as well.
(Emphasis supplied).
12.
It is significant to mention that in the aforenoted letter there is an admission by the Developer that the construction is still not completed.
Additionally, even the specific date of delivery of possession has not been mentioned anywhere either in the Written Version or in the Affidavit or even in the letter dated 03.04.2017 which the Counsel is relying upon.
Concluding that the Appellant was deficient in rendering service, the Commission granted relief to the Respondents in following terms 14.
Keeping in view the admitted incomplete construction, the fact that some of the Complainants have also taken bank loans and are paying EMIs and considering the stipulation provided in Clause 11.4, this Complaint is partly allowed directing the Developer to refund the amounts deposited with simple interest 9 p.a.
from the respective dates of deposits till the date of realization together with costs of Rs.50,000/ to be paid to each of the Complainants.
The directions are to be complied withing fours weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of the order, failing which, the amount shall attract interest 12 p.a.
for the said period.
11.
Similarly, all other complaints were allowed by the Commission granting relief of refund of the amounts deposited by each of the Complainants with simple interest 9 per annum from the respective dates of deposits alongwith Rs.50,000/ towards costs.
It was also directed that the amounts be deposited within four weeks, failing which the amounts would carry interest 12 per annum.
12.
The Appellant being aggrieved preferred the instant appeals on 14.03.2019.
By way of Additional Documents, a copy of the letter dated 17.11.2017 was placed on record.
An order passed by Haryana Authority, Gurugram on 17.01.2019 in a complaint preferred by one Himanshu Giri was also placed on record.
The directions issued in said order were to the following effect 27.
After taking into consideration all the material facts as adduced and produced by both the parties, the authority exercising powers vested in it under section 37 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 hereby issues the following directions to the respondent in the interest of justice and fair play i.
The respondent is directed to provide delay possession charges at the prescribed rate of 10.75 per annum for every month of delay w.e.f. 15.9.2016 as per the provisions of Section 18(1) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.
ii.
The arrears of interest accrued so far shall be paid to the complainant within 90 days from the date of this order and thereafter monthly payment of interest till handing over the possession shall be paid before 10th of subsequent month.
13.
The appeal memo also did not make any reference to the fact that the Project had been registered under the RERA Act.
In the leading appeal, following assertions were made in the list of dates and events 20112017
The Appellant was unable to hand over the possession to the Respondents within the stipulate time as stipulated in Clause 10.1 due to reasons beyond control of the Appellant viz., due to severe shortage of contractual labourers and delay caused in obtaining statutory requisite permissions for carrying on the construction of said flats, failed to deliver possession of the subject flats to the Respondents within the prescribed time limit.
One of the grounds raised in the appeal memo was as under C. Because the Honble Commission failed to appreciate that the Policy of Demonetization introduced by the Government of India constituted as an event of Force Majeure since as a consequence of the said event, numerous persons including the Appellant suffered shortage of cash which resulted in delay in delivering possession to the Respondent.
It is humbly submitted that the shortage of cash ensuing as a result of the Demonitization policy resulted in the stopping of work since the process of construction requires many payments to be made in cash on a day to day basis, for example, wages paid to daily wage workers, payments made against delivery of construction materials, etc. 14.
After issuance of notice on 05.04.2019, it was submitted by the Respondents that the Appellant had partially refunded the amounts in terms of the directions of the Commission.
Following details indicate that in four out of ten cases, partial refund was made.
Table Refund of Rs.10,00,000/ to the Respondents, was made on 27.03.2019 i.e. even after filing of the leading appeal.
15.
Mr. Vikas Singh, learned Senior Advocate for the Appellant submitted inter alia a)
The Appellant had completed PhaseI of the Project wellintime and PhaseII of the Project concerning about 437 allottees was the matter in issue.
Out of these 437 allottees, only in 59 cases complaints were filed under the CP Act, while Mr. Himanshu Giri had approached authorities under the RERA Act.
A majority of the allottees had thus reposed faith in the Appellant.
b)
The Appellant had offered alternative accommodation to all the allottees.
But the offer was rejected by all the Complainants which was indicative that the apartments were booked for investment purposes.
c)
The Complainants were not Consumers within the meaning of the CP Act as the apartments were booked merely for profit motive.
d)
Once the RERA Act came into force, all questions concerning the Project including issues relating to construction and completion thereof, would be under the exclusive control and jurisdiction of the authorities under the RERA Act.
The Commission, therefore, ought not to have entertained the Consumer Cases.
e)
The Registration Certificate dated 17.11.2017 being valid upto 31.12.2020, the Appellant could not be said to have delayed the construction and consequently, there could be no finding that there was deficiency on part of the Appellant.
f)
The order passed in the case of Himanshu Giri had directed payment of interest 10.75 per annum without issuing any direction for refund of money.
The approach so adopted would be conducive to completion of construction and at the same time would balance the interest of the allottees.
g)
Considering the provisions of the RERA Act and the fact that the registration being valid upto 31.12.2020, the orders passed by the Commission be set aside and instead the Complainants be granted interest 10.75 p.a.
on the amounts deposited whereby the Project would be completed without putting the Appellant under any financial strain and at the same time the relief in the nature of interest on investment would also be accruable to the allottees.
16.
Ms. Priyanjali Singh, learned Advocate for the Respondents as well as for some of the other Complainants submitted a) All the Complainants had purchased only one residential apartment each for selfuse.
They had taken home loans, except the Complainant in Consumer Case No.3020 of 2017 who after his retirement as Group Captain from the Indian Air Force had used all his retirement dues to book the apartment.
Therefore, the issue whether the Complainants satisfied the requirements of being Consumers under the provisions of the CP Act was rightly decided in favour of the Complainants.
b)
The question whether the delay occurred due to force majeure events was also rightly answered in favour of the Complainants and no reasonable explanation was available on record to dislodge that finding.
c)
In the backdrop of these findings, the Commission was justified in accepting the claim of the Complainants.
In fact, the award of interest 9 per annum was at a lower level.
d)
At no stage, any plea was taken before the Commission that the Project was registered under the RERA Act or about the effect of the RERA Act.
No such plea was taken even in the appeal memo.
Consequently, it would not be open to the Appellant to raise any submissions about the applicability of the RERA Act.
e) In any case, as construed by this Court consistently, the remedy afforded by the CP Act would be an additional remedy to a consumer and said legal position remained unchanged even after the enactment of the RERA Act.
17.
Three Complainants viz.
(a) Chandra Shekhar (b) Rajat Verma and (c) Krishan Kumar appeared in person and advanced submissions.
It was submitted, inter alia, that the decision of the Commission did not call for any interference and that they be refunded the entire amount with 12 interest instead of 9 as awarded by the Commission.
18.
At the outset, we must deal with two factual issues.
It was concluded by the Commission that (i) all the Complainants were Consumers within the meaning of the Act and that (ii) there was delay on part of the Appellant in completing the construction within time.
The stand taken by the Appellant at various stages, itself acknowledged that there was delay but the Appellant tried to rely on certain events as mentioned in ground (c) quoted hereinabove.
In our view, the conclusions drawn by the National Commission in relation to these issues are absolutely correct and do not call for any interference.
19.
Before we deal with the issues about the applicability and effect of the RERA Act as well as the effect of registration of the Project under the RERA Act, the relevant provisions of the CP Act and the RERA Act may be extracted A The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 The CP Act was enacted, inter alia, to provide for better protection of the interest of the consumer to promote and protect the rights of consumers such as the rights to seek redressal against unfair trade practices or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers.
Sections 3, 12(4) and 24 were to the following effect  3.
Act not in derogation of any other law.
The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force.
12.
Manner in which complaint shall be made. .
(1) (2) (3) (4) Where a complaint is allowed to be proceeded with under subsection (3), the District Forum may proceed with the complaint in the manner provided under this Act Provided that where a complaint has been admitted by the District Forum, it shall not be transferred to any other court or tribunal or any authority set up by or under any other law for the time being in force.
24.
Finality of orders.
Every order of a District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission shall, if no appeal has been preferred against such order under the provisions of this Act, be final.

89.
Act to have overriding effect The provisions of this Act shall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.
20.
The question whether the remedies available to the consumers under the provisions of the CP Act would be additional remedies, was considered by this Court in some cases, the notable cases being i)
In Secretary, Thirumurugan Cooperative Agricultural Credit Society vs. M. Lalitha (dead) through LRs.
and others (2004) 1 SCC 305 , this Court observed 11.
From the Statement of Objects and Reasons and the scheme of the 1986 Act, it is apparent that the main objective of the Act is to provide for better protection of the interest of the consumer and for that purpose to provide for better redressal, mechanism through which cheaper, easier, expeditious and effective redressal is made available to consumers.
To serve the purpose of the Act, various quasijudicial forums are set up at the district, State and national level with wide range of powers vested in them.
These quasijudicial forums, observing the principles of natural justice, are empowered to give relief of a specific nature and to award, wherever appropriate, compensation to the consumers and to impose penalties for noncompliance with their orders.
12.
As per Section 3 of the Act, as already stated above, the provisions of the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other provisions of any other law for the time being in force.
Having due regard to the scheme of the Act and purpose sought to be achieved to protect the interest of the consumers better, the provisions are to be interpreted broadly, positively and purposefully in the context of the present case to give meaning to additional extended jurisdiction, particularly when Section 3 seeks to provide remedy under the Act in addition to other remedies provided under other Acts unless there is a clear bar.
The issue in this case was whether in the face of Section 156 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983 the concerned persons could avail remedies under the CP Act.
Interpreting Section 3 of the CP Act, it was held that the remedy provided under the CP Act would be in addition to the remedies provided under the other Acts.
ii)
In National Seeds Corporation Limited vs. M. Madhusudhan Reddy and another (2012) 2 SCC 506 , it was observed 57.
It can thus be said that in the context of farmers growers and other consumers of seeds, the Seeds Act is a special legislation insofar as the provisions contained therein ensure that those engaged in agriculture and horticulture get quality seeds and any person who violates the provisions of the Act and or the Rules is brought before the law and punished.
However, there is no provision in that Act and the Rules framed thereunder for compensating the farmers, etc. who may suffer adversely due to loss of crop or deficient yield on account of defective seeds supplied by a person authorised to sell the seeds.
That apart, there is nothing in the Seeds Act and the Rules which may give an indication that the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act are not available to the farmers who are otherwise covered by the wide definition of consumer under Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act.
As a matter of fact, any attempt to exclude the farmers from the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act by implication will make that Act vulnerable to an attack of unconstitutionality on the ground of discrimination and there is no reason why the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act should be so interpreted.
62.
Since the farmers growers purchased seeds by paying a price to the appellant, they would certainly fall within the ambit of Section 2(1)(d)(i) of the Consumer Protection Act and there is no reason to deny them the remedies which are available to other consumers of goods and services.
In this case the provisions of the CP Act and those under the Seeds Act, 1966 were considered.
iii)
In Virender Jain vs. Alaknanda Cooperative Group Housing Society Limited and others (2013) 9 SCC 383 , it was observed by this Court as under 13.
The other question which needs to be considered is whether the District Forum should not have entertained the complaints filed by the appellants and directed them to avail the statutory remedies available under the Cooperative Societies Act.
Shri Neeraj Jain vehemently argued that the forums constituted under the Act cannot grant relief to the appellants because the action taken by Respondent 1 was approved by the authorities constituted under the Cooperative Societies Act, who were not impleaded as parties in the complaints.
14.
In our view, there is no merit in the submission of the learned Senior Counsel.
In the complaints filed by them, the appellants had primarily challenged the action of Respondent 1 to refund the amounts deposited by them and thereby extinguished their entitlement to get the flats.
Therefore, the mere fact that the action taken by Respondent 1 was approved by the Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies and higher authorities, cannot deprive the appellants of their legitimate right to seek remedy under the Act, which is in addition to the other remedies available to them under the Cooperative Societies Act.
Law on this issue must be treated as settled by the judgments of this Court in Thirumurugan Coop.
Agricultural Credit Society v. M. Lalitha (2004) 1 SCC 305 , Kishore Lal v. ESI Corpn.
(2007) 4 SCC 579 and National Seeds Corpn.
Ltd. v. M. Madhusudhan Reddy (2012) 2 SCC 506 .
15.
In the last mentioned judgment, National Seeds Corpn.
Case (2012) 2 SCC 506 , this Court referred to the earlier judgments in Fair Air Engineers (P) Ltd. v. N.K. Modi (1996) 6 SCC 385 , Thirumurugan Coop.
Agricultural Credit Society v. M. Lalitha (2004) 1 SCC 305 , Skypak Couriers Ltd. v. Tata Chemicals Ltd. (2000) 5 SCC 294 and Trans Mediterranean Airways v. Universal Exports (2011) 10 SCC 316 and held that the remedy available under the Act is in addition to the remedies available under other statutes and the availability of alternative remedies is not a bar to the entertaining of a complaint filed under the Act.
In this case the statutory remedies available under the Haryana Cooperative Societies Act, 1984 as against those under the CP Act was the matter in issue.
21.
It has consistently been held by this Court that the remedies available under the provisions of the CP Act are additional remedies over and above the other remedies including those made available under any special statutes and that the availability of an alternate remedy is no bar in entertaining a complaint under the CP Act.
22.
Before we consider whether the provisions of the RERA Act have made any change in the legal position stated in the preceding paragraph, we may note that an allottee placed in circumstances similar to that of the Complainants, could have initiated following proceedings before the RERA Act came into force.
A)
If he satisfied the requirements of being a consumer under the CP Act, he could have initiated proceedings under the CP Act in addition to normal civil remedies.
B)
However, if he did not fulfil the requirements of being a consumer, he could initiate and avail only normal civil remedies.
C)
If the agreement with the developer or the builder provided for arbitration i) in cases covered under Clause B hereinabove, he could initiate or could be called upon to invoke the remedies in arbitration.
ii) in cases covered under Clause
A hereinabove, in accordance with law laid down in Emaar MGF Ltd and anr.
Vs.
Aftab Singh (2019) 12 SCC 751 , he could still choose to proceed under the CP Act.
23.
In terms of Section 18 of the RERA Act, if a promoter fails to complete or is unable to give possession of an apartment duly completed by the date specified in the agreement, the Promoter would be liable, on demand, to return the amount received by him in respect of that apartment if the allottee wishes to withdraw from the Project.
Such right of an allottee is specifically made without prejudice to any other remedy available to him.
The right so given to the allottee is unqualified and if availed, the money deposited by the allottee has to be refunded with interest at such rate as may be prescribed.
The proviso to Section 18(1) contemplates a situation where the allottee does not intend to withdraw from the Project.
In that case he is entitled to and must be paid interest for every month of delay till the handing over of the possession.
It is upto the allottee to proceed either under Section 18(1) or under proviso to Section 18(1).
The case of Himanshu Giri came under the latter category.
The RERA Act thus definitely provides a remedy to an allottee who wishes to withdraw from the Project or claim return on his investment.
24.
It is, therefore, required to be considered whether the remedy so provided under the RERA Act to an allottee is the only and exclusive modality to raise a grievance and whether the provisions of the RERA Act bar consideration of the grievance of an allottee by other fora. 25.
Section 79 of the RERA Act bars jurisdiction of a Civil Court to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which the Authority or the adjudicating officer or the Appellate Tribunal is empowered under the RERA Act to determine.
Section 88 specifies that the provisions of the RERA Act would be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law, while in terms of Section 89, the provisions of the RERA Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force.
26.
On plain reading of Section 79 of the RERA Act, an allottee described in category (B) stated in paragraph 22 hereinabove, would stand barred from invoking the jurisdiction of a Civil Court.
However, as regards the allottees who can be called consumers within the meaning of the CP Act, two questions would arise a) whether the bar specified under Section 79 of the RERA Act would apply to proceedings initiated under the provisions of the CP Act and b) whether there is anything inconsistent in the provisions of the CP Act with that of the RERA Act.
27.
In Malay Kumar Ganguli vs. Dr. Sukumar Mukherjee (2009) 9 SCC 221 , it was held by this Court
The proceedings before the National Commission are although judicial proceedings, but at the same time it is not a civil court within the meaning of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.
It may have all the trappings of the civil court but yet it cannot be called a civil court.
(See Bharat Bank Ltd. V. Employees AIR 1950 SC 188 1950 SCR 459 and Nahar Industrial Enterprises Ltd. vs. Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corpn (2009) 6 SCC 635 .
On the strength of the law so declared, Section 79 of the RERA Act does not in any way bar the Commission or Forum under the provisions of the CP Act to entertain any complaint.
28.
Proviso to Section 71(1) of the RERA Act entitles a complainant who had initiated proceedings under the CP Act before the RERA Act came into force, to withdraw the proceedings under the CP Act with the permission of the Forum or Commission and file an appropriate application before the adjudicating officer under the RERA Act.
The proviso thus gives a right or an option to the concerned complainant but does not statutorily force him to withdraw such complaint nor do the provisions of the RERA Act create any mechanism for transfer of such pending proceedings to authorities under the RERA Act.
As against that the mandate in Section 12(4) of the CP Act to the contrary is quite significant.
Again, insofar as cases where such proceedings under the CP Act are initiated after the provisions of the RERA Act came into force, there is nothing in the RERA Act which bars such initiation.
The absence of bar under Section 79 to the initiation of proceedings before a fora which cannot be called a Civil Court and express saving under Section 88 of the RERA Act, make the position quite clear.
Further, Section 18 itself specifies that the remedy under said Section is without prejudice to any other remedy available.
Thus, the parliamentary intent is clear that a choice or discretion is given to the allottee whether he wishes to initiate appropriate proceedings under the CP Act or file an application under the RERA Act.
29.
It was, however, urged that going by the objective or the purpose for which the RERA Act was enacted and considering the special expertise and the qualifications of the Chairpersons and Members of the Authority (Section 22) and the Appellate Tribunal (Section 46), such authorities alone must be held entitled to decide all issues concerning the Project registered under the RERA Act.
It was submitted that if the allottees were to be permitted to initiate parallel proceedings before the fora under the CP Act, the financial drain on the promoter would render completion of construction an impossibility and, therefore, the RERA Act in general and Section 89 in particular be construed in such a way that all the issues pertaining to the concerned project be decided only by the authorities under the RERA Act.
Even with acceptance of such interpretation, the allottees would still be entitled to approach the authorities under Section 18 of the RERA Act.
30.
It is true that some special authorities are created under the RERA Act for the regulation and promotion of the real estate sector and the issues concerning a registered project are specifically entrusted to functionaries under the RERA Act.
But for the present purposes, we must go by the purport of Section 18 of the RERA Act.
Since it gives a right without prejudice to any other remedy available, in effect, such other remedy is acknowledged and saved subject always to the applicability of Section 79.
31.
At this stage, we may profitably refer to the decision in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited and another vs. Union of India and another (2019) 8 SCC 416 , where a bench of three Judges of this Court was called upon to consider the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, RERA Act and other legislations including the provisions of the CP Act.
One of the conclusions arrived at by this Court was 100.
RERA is to be read harmoniously with the Code, as amended by the Amendment Act.
It is only in the event of conflict that the Code will prevail over RERA.
Remedies that are given to allottees of flats apartments are therefore concurrent remedies, such allottees of flats apartments being in a position to avail of remedies under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, RERA as well as the triggering of the Code.
32.
We, therefore, reject the submissions advanced by the Appellant and answer the questions raised in paragraph 26 hereinabove against the Appellant.
33.
We may now consider the effect of the registration of the Project under the RERA Act.
In the present case the apartments were booked by the Complainants in 20112012 and the Builder Buyer Agreements were entered into in November, 2013.
As promised, the construction should have been completed in 42 months.
The period had expired well before the Project was registered under the provisions of the RERA Act.
Merely because the registration under the RERA Act is valid till 31.12.2020 does not mean that the entitlement of the concerned allottees to maintain an action stands deferred.
It is relevant to note that even for the purposes of Section 18, the period has to be reckoned in terms of the agreement and not the registration.
Condition no.
(x) of the letter dated 17.11.2017 also entitles an allottee in same fashion.
Therefore, the entitlement of the Complainants must be considered in the light of the terms of the Builder Buyer Agreements and was rightly dealt with by the Commission.
34.
Lastly, it may be noted that the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (hereinafter referred as, 2019 Act) was enacted by the Parliament to provide for protection of the interests of consumers and for the said purpose, to establish authorities for timely and effectively administration and settlement of the consumers dispute and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
Sections 2(7), 2(33), 2(37), and 2(42) define expressions Consumer, Product, Product Seller and Service respectively.
Sections 85 and 86 deal with liability of Product Service Provider and Product Seller.
Sections 100 and 107 of 2019 Act are to the following effect 100.
The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force.
107.
(1) The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is hereby repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under the Act hereby repealed shall, in so far as it Is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken under the corresponding provisions of this Act.
(3) The mention of particular matters in subsection (2) shall not be held to prejudice or affect the general application of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 with regard to the effect of repeal.
Section 100 of 2019 Act is akin to Section 3 of the CP Act and Section 107 saves all actions taken or purported to have been taken under the CP Act.
It is significant that Section 100 is enacted with an intent to secure the remedies under 2019 Act dealing with protection of the interests of Consumers, even after the RERA Act was brought into force.
Thus, the proceedings initiated by the complainants in the present cases and the resultant actions including the orders passed by the Commission are fully saved.
35.
Resultantly, we reject all the submissions advanced by the Appellant.
These appeals are accordingly dismissed affirming the view taken by the Commission.
We quantify the costs at Rs.50,000/ (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) to be paid by the Appellant in respect of each of the Consumer Cases, over and above the amounts directed to be made over to the Complainants and shall form part of the amount payable by the Appellant to the Complainants.
36.
All the Complainants are entitled to execute the orders passed by the Commission in their favour, in accordance with law.
