5.7 Respondent No.2Complainant submits that sometime in November 2005, she noticed abnormal visual responses in the Respondent No.1 baby.
The Complainant asked for the medical records of the baby to have his follow up treatment done.
The medical records were, however, not made available by Appellant No.1Hospital.
5.8
On 23.11.2005, Respondent No.2 Complainant took the baby to Nayantara Eye Clinic, Delhi where an ultrasound (B. Scan) was conducted.
It was advised that eyeointment and eyedrops be administered to the baby.
5.9
On 03.12.2005, the baby was taken by Respondent No.2 Complainant to Shroff Charity Eye Hospital, Delhi for further examination where the ultrasound (B. Scan) was conducted.
The Shroff Charity Eye Hospital diagnosed that the baby had ROP Stage 5 in both eyes, which is a case of total retinal detachment.
5.10 Respondent No.2Complainant approached Respondent No.4 Dr Rama Sharma, the Gynaecologist of Sharma Medical Centre to explain how the medical condition of Respondent No.1baby had remained un diagnosed.
Dr. Rama Sharma shifted the blame to the Appellants.
5.11 On 07.12.2005, Respondent No.2Complainant took the baby to the Appellant No.1Hospital in the Private OPD Consultation.
Dr. Sanjay Bhavan, Ophthalmologist examined Respondent No.1baby.
The case was referred to Dr. Lingam Gopal of Shankara Netralaya at Chennai for an urgent appointment.
5.12 On 07.01.2006, the Respondent No.1baby was taken by his mother Respondent No.2Complainant to Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences at AIIMS, New Delhi for OPD Consultation.
After examination, it was confirmed that it was a case of ROP Stage 5. 5.13
On 24.02.2007, the Respondent No.2Complainant was constrained to issue a legal notice to the Appellant No.1Hospital to provide the entire inpatient medical records of the baby in compliance with Regulation 1.3.2 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquettes and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 ( IMC Regulations).
5.14 The Appellant Nos. 1 to 3 failed to provide the in patient medical records to the Complainant despite the issuance of legal notice.
5.15
The Respondent No.2Complainant then filed a complaint with the Delhi Medical Council for a direction to the Appellant No.1Hospital to provide the complete inpatient medical records pertaining to the baby.
5.16
Eventually, the Appellant No.1Hospital provided a copy of the medical records of the baby alongwith the Case Summary on 14.06.2007 after more than 2 years of discharge from the Appellant No.1Hospital.
5.17
The Respondent No.2Complainant contends that when she received these records, she was shocked to find that the medical records mentioned an alleged ROP checkup was conducted on 26.04.2005 by Appellant No.4Dr.
S.N. Jha.
The Respondent No.2 Complainant contends that no ROP examination was conducted by Appellant No.4Dr.
S.N. Jha.
5.18
On 04.08.2007, the Respondent No.2Complainant addressed a letter to the Medical Superintendent of Appellant No.1 Hospital.
The relevant extract of the said letter is reproduced hereinbelow for ready reference Under the above enclosure we have received photocopies of some Medical Record (uncertified) along with a case summary dated 13 062007.
The said summary states that on 26042007 ROP examination on our baby was conducted in the Ophthalmological unit of your hospital and review examination after two weeks was also advised.
We are rather intrigued by this observation as it does not find mention anywhere in the Discharge Summary nor is there any follow up advise.
Since both of us do not recollect any such examination conducted in our presence or review advise and the said medical record is also totally silent about it, kindly provide us with the entire record of the Ophthalmological unit, name of the Paediatric Ophthalmologist who had conducted the ROP examination and his written report dated 26042006.
emphasis supplied 5.19 Appellant No.1 Hospital replied to the letter on 24.08.2007, wherein it was stated that As per standard neonatal protocol, ophthalmological checkup was requested on 25042005 to rule out ROP.
The ophthalmological examination was done in the Nursery on 26 042005 morning by Dr. S. N. Jha, Senior Consultant Ophthalmologist.
The written report of the Ophthalmological unit is stated on page no.102 of the case record.
emphasis supplied 5.20 On 19.11.2007, Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 filed a Consumer Complaint under Section 21 (a)(i) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 before the National Commission Consumer Case No. 119
Of 2007 claiming compensation of Rs.
1,30,25,000/ alleging medical negligence and deficiency in service on the part of Appellant Nos. 1 to 4, and Respondent No.4 the Gynaecologist, for compensation for the permanent physical disability, mental agony, and social stigma, deprivation of normal human life, companionship, torture and harassment etc.
5.21 The Delhi Medical Council vide order dated 14.12.2007 issued a warning to the Appellant No.1Hospital for the delay in supplying the medical records of the Respondent No.1baby to the Complainant.
5.22
The National Commission vide Order dated 29.02.2012 directed the Medical Board, AIIMS to give an expert opinion in the matter.
5.23
The Medical Board of AIIMS submitted its Report dated 11.05.2012 to the National Commission.
The Report states that as per standard guidelines (National Neonatology Forum), new born babies who are born at 32 weeks gestation or less, should have their eyes examined at 34 weeks of age and more frequent checkups to be done thereafter.
Appellant No.4 Dr. S.N. Jha examined the baby at 24 days of age in accordance with established protocol.
If ROP screening does not reveal any ROP, then repeat examination should be performed after 2 weeks.
The Report goes on to say that after discharge, the baby was brought twice to the General OPD of the Appellant No.1 Hospital.
There is no record to show that the baby was brought after 2 weeks of discharge to the Paediatrics OPD clinic when subsequent progression could been assessed and treated on time.
6.
The National Commission vide its Judgment and Order dated 10.05.2016 (bench comprising of Presiding Member J.M. Malik J. and Dr. S.M. Kantikar, a qualified doctor) held as under 6.1 The National Commission
was not convinced that the ROP screening was done by O.P. No.5/Appellant No.4 on Respondent No.1baby.
The progress sheet was devoid of any details about the ROP examination, the method and instruments used, drugs (midrates tropicamide) anaesthesia used during ROP testing.
The Ophthalmologist has not mentioned any details of the dilation of the pupils, and the findings by indirect ophthalmoscope, and the intraocular or extra retinal findings.
The standard ROP screening protocol was not followed.
The Nurses Daily Records from 25.04.2005 to 27.04.2005 does not show that any ROP examination was done by O.P. No. 5/Appellant No. 4.
6.2 The AIIMS Report did not comment about the details of the ROP screening and the followup findings.
6.3
The National Commission held that the sequence of events leading to ROP usually takes about 4 to 5 weeks, except in a small subset of premature infants who develop rush disease in 2 to 3 weeks.
The routine screenings should begin at no later than 4 weeks after birth, and possibly even earlier for infants at higher risk (2 to 3 weeks).
It is strongly recommended that one session of retinal screening be carried before Day 30 of the life of any premature baby.
The examination should be done with the dilation of the pupil with Tropicamide 0.5 to 1 with Phenylapinephrine 2.5.
6.4
The National Commission came to the conclusion that O.P. No.5/Appellant No.4 did not conduct the ROP screening on the baby.
ROP screening is a teamwork of the Paediatrician, Opthalmologist and the NICU nurse.
There is no medical documentation of the ROP screening procedural details.
The O.P. No. 5 should have performed the retinal examination with binocular indirect opthalmoscope on dilation of the pupil with scleral depression to ascertain avascular zone at the periphery of the retina.
The National Commission found that nothing was forthcoming from Page 102 of the medical records.
It appears to be a bare visual examination done by O.P. No. 5 in haste to cover up the case.
The National Commission was of the considered view that neither the ROP screening was performed, nor was any advice for follow up of ROP given to the Respondent No.2Complainant mother.
6.5
The National Commission held that the Respondent No.1Master Rishabh had been rendered blind for life, which could never really be compensated in monetary terms.
The baby had lost his father during the pendency of proceedings in 2013.
The Respondent No.2Complainant had been pursuing the consumer complaint singlehandedly for almost a decade.
6.6
The National Commission awarded an amount of Rs. 53,00,000/ to the Respondent No.1baby by applying the average inflationary principle at a conservative rate of 1 p.a., keeping in mind the fluctuations over the next 59 years.
The National Commission awarded an amount of Rs.
10,00,000/ to the Respondent No.2Complainant mother who would have to take care of the blind child throughout her life.
A further amount of Rs. 1,00,000/ was awarded towards costs of litigation.
The National Commission held O.P. Nos. 2 to 5/ Appellant Nos. 1 to 4 to be jointly and severally liable to pay the total amount of Rs.
64,00,000/ within 2 months of the Order.
The entire amount would carry interest at the rate of 9 p.a.
Out of the total compensation awarded, Rs.
50,00,000/ would be kept in a Fixed Deposit with a nationalised bank till Respondent No.1 attained the age of majority.
The periodic interest on the deposit would be paid to the Respondent No.2 Complainant mother till the child attained the age of majority.
The remaining amount of Rs.
14,00,000/ would be released to the Respondent No.2Complainant.
7. Aggrieved by the impugned Judgment passed by the National Commission, C.A. No. 6619 of 2016 was filed by the Hospital and the Doctors before this Court.
The Complainants have filed Civil Appeal No. 9461 of 2019 (Diary No. 15393 of 2019) before this Court for enhancement of compensation.
This Court vide interim Order dated 29.07.2016 ordered stay of the operation of the impugned Judgment, subject to the Appellant No.1Hospital depositing 50 of the amount awarded by the National Commission in this Court within 6 weeks.
On 07.09.2016, the Appellant No.1Hospital deposited an amount of Rs.
32,00,000/ in this Court.
This Court vide Order dated 7.11.2016, directed the amount to be kept in a Fixed Deposit with UCO Bank, which was renewed from time to time.
The fixed deposit is due to mature on 17.02.2020. 8.
We have heard the learned Counsel for all the parties and perused the original Medical Records, pleadings and written submissions filed by the parties.
9.
The learned counsel for the Appellants viz.
the Hospital and Doctors inter alia submitted that 9.1 Respondent No.1baby was preterm (32 weeks) with signs of HMD, and was admitted in Appellant No.1 Hospital on 02.04.2005 in a critical condition with little chance of survival.
The baby was admitted in the neonatal ICU, and had to be immediately placed on ventilatory support for 10 days.
As per standard protocol, regular investigations and Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) analysis were performed.
Blood component therapy was given.
The critical condition of the baby and possible neurodevelopment, visual and hearing sequel was informed to the parents.
The baby was given utmost care and attention by the Doctors of the Appellant No.1Hospital.
9.2 As per protocol, ophthalmological examination was advised on 25.04.2005 to rule out ROP, as recorded at Page 100 of the medical records.
Appellant No.4Dr.
S.N. Jha, the Senior Ophthalmologist conducted the ROP test on 26.04.2005, who found no ROP in Respondent No.1baby, as recorded by Appellant No.4 in his handwriting at page 102 of the medical records.
It was submitted that the Appellant No.4 had advised a further review checkup after 2 weeks in the speciality OPD on Wednesay Saturday between 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.
The parents of Respondent No.1baby were explained all the problems which may develop in a premature baby.
9.3
As per the Discharge Summary at Page 109 of the medical records, the Complainants were advised to bring the Respondent No.1baby for a ROP and BERA checkup to the speciality OPD on Wednesday Saturday at 4 pm.
9.4
The Respondent No.2Complainant brought the baby to the General OPD of Appellant No.1 Hospital on 04.05.2005 after 8 days of the first ROP checkup, and not after 2 weeks as advised.
Thereafter, the baby was brought on 13.07.2005, which was after 2 months again to the General OPD.
9.5
The Appellants relied on the Report of the Medical Board constituted by AIIMS, which had vide their Report dated 11.05.2012 held that the baby was not brought to the Paediatrics OPD Clinic on Wednesdays or Saturdays at 4 P.M. after two weeks of discharge, when subsequent progression of ROP could have been assessed and treated on time.
9.6
The Appellant No.4/O.P. No.5  Dr. S.N. Jha, a Senior Ophthalmologist was engaged with the Appellant No.1 Hospital from 1997 to 2010.
It was submitted on his behalf that on 25.04.2005, the Paediatrics Dept. of the Appellant No.1Hospital had requisitioned him to perform the ROP examination.
The Appellant No.4 submits that the ROP was duly conducted by him on 26.04.2005.
His finding is recorded at Page 102 of the medical records, wherein he has recorded that he did not find any evidence of ROP at that stage.
It was further submitted that it was not required to record the method of dilation of the pupil and use of indirect ophthalmoscope.
The standard medical literature establishes that ROP manifests itself after 4 weeks of postnatal age.
In view thereof, the finding of Appellant No.4, who examined the baby only on 26.04.2005 i.e. when the baby was 24 days old, there was no evidence of ROP, cannot be faulted.
9.7
It was further submitted that the only requirement for conducting an ROP examination is a chemical solution of Tropicamide and Phenylephrine to dilate the eyes, which was available in the nursery, and an indirect ophthalmoscope, which is available with all ophthalmologists.
who have specialised in the care of retina, and are competent to carry ROP examination.
It was submitted that the Appellant No.4 was not required to record the procedure for conducting the ROP examination, which is merely the retinal examination of the baby by use of an indirect ophthalmoscope after dilation of the pupils.
9.8 Appellant No.4  Dr. S.N. Jha was not consulted on the two subsequent visits by the Respondent No.2 Complainant with the baby on 04.05.2005 and 13.07.2005 in the Ophthalmology department, even though he would have been available in the speciality OPD on Wednesdays Saturdays at 4 P.M.10.
The learned counsel for the Complainants Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 (Appellant Nos. 1 to 3 in Civil Appeal No. 9461 of 2019/Diary No. 15393 of 2019), inter alia submitted that the Respondent No.1baby has become permanently blind on account of the gross medical negligence by the Hospital, and the three specialist doctors i.e two consultant Paediatricians, and the Ophthalmologist, for the following reasons 10.1
The Appellant Nos.1 to 4 did not at any stage conduct the ROP examination of the baby, who was a premature baby, nor was the family ever informed about the high risk of ROP in a premature baby, and the necessity for regular checkups.
10.2
The Appellant No.1Hospital had deliberately withheld the medical records for over two years after discharge.
At the time of discharge on 29.04.2005, the Complainants were provided with a Discharge Slip, which did not disclose any instructions advising that the infant be brought for ROP examination (the Discharge Slip in Para 5.4 above).
In this Discharge Slip, there is no advice of ROP having been conducted, or followup of ROP, nor was the risk of ROP explained by the Appellant Nos. 2 and 3 to the Respondent No.2Complainant.
10.3
The Complainants have strongly contended that parts of the medical records, which were provided after 2 years in 2007, had been fabricated and interpolated as an afterthought to escape liability.
It was submitted that a bare perusal of the noting dated 26.04.2005 made in the medical record by Appellant No.4 the Ophthalmologist, shows that is merely a scribble, and is illegible.
The Complainants have strongly refuted the case of the Appellants that 2 the ROP was conducted by Appellant No.4 on 26.04.2005.
The Complainants have supported their submission on the basis of (i) the progress sheets, which contain no details of the ROP examination (ii) there is no mention of the ROP examination in the Nurses Daily Record (iii) ROP exam is conducted with the help of dilation by using Cyclopentolate (0.5) and Phenylephrine (2.5) drops to be applied 2 to 3 times, about 1015 minutes apart.
There is no record with respect to the administration of the these medicines to the baby (iv) there is no mention of the ROP test in the Discharge Slip of 29.04.2005 10.4
The Complainants contended that if the standard protocol had been carried out by the Doctors, the ROP would have been detected at an early stage, and could have been cured, since it is medically known to be reversible at the early stages.
On account of the negligence of the Appellant Nos. 1 to 4, the ROP was discovered only at Stage 5, by the Shroff Charity Eye Hospital, when the baby was 8 24 months old.
By this time, the ROP became irreversible, and resulted in total blindness of the Respondent No.1 baby.
10.5
It was further urged that the quantum of compensation awarded by the National Commission was grossly inadequate and insufficient.
The National Commission failed to take into account variables such as the additional educational expenses in special schools, transportation costs, costs of purchasing, maintaining and upgrading Visual Aid Assistive Devices, costs of permanent nursing attendant care and miscellaneous medical expenses.
It was further contended that the average rate of inflation taken by the National Commission i.e. a conservative rate of 1 per annum for the next 59 years, was grossly undervalued.
The Complainants sought enhancement of the compensation to the extent of Rs. 9,87,84,000/. 11.
Discussion and Analysis 11.1 Inordinate Delay in Supply of Medical Records We find that there was an inordinate delay of over 2 years in making the Medical Records of Respondent No.1 25 Master Rishabh available to the Respondent No.2 Complainant.
Regulation 1.3.2 of the IMC Regulations casts a statutory obligation upon every doctor hospital to provide medical records within 72 hours of the request being made by the patient.
11.1.1
The Medical Council of India has framed the IMC Regulations with the previous approval of the Central Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 20A read with Section 33(m) of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.
The IMC Regulations came into force on their publication in the Gazette of India on 06.04.2002, and have statutory force.
11.1.2 Regulation 1.3.2 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquettes and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 provides as under 1.3 Maintenance of medical records 1.3.1 Every physician shall maintain the medical records pertaining to his her indoor patients for a period of 3 years from the date of commencement of the treatment in a standard proforma laid down by the Medical Council of India and attached as Appendix 3. 1.3.2.

The medical certificate shall be prepared as in Appendix 2.
1.3.4 Efforts shall be made to computerize medical records for quick retrieval.
emphasis supplied As per Regulation 7, if the doctor refuses or fails to provide the medical records within 72 hours when the patient or his her authorised representative makes a request as per the Regulation 1.3.2, the said act of commission or omission would constitute professional misconduct rendering him her liable for disciplinary action and punishment under Regulation 8.
Regulations 7 and 8 provide as follows 7.
MISCONDUCT The following acts of commission or omission on the part of a physician shall constitute professional misconduct rendering him her liable for disciplinary action 7.1 Violation of the Regulations If he she commits any violation of these Regulations.
7.2
If he she does not maintain the medical records of his her indoor patients for a period of three years as per regulation 1.3 and refuses to provide the same within 72 hours when the patient or his her authorised representative makes a request for it as per the regulation 1.3.2.
27 8.
PUNISHMENT AND DISCIPLINARY ACTION 8.1
It must be clearly understood that the instances of offences and of Professional misconduct which are given above do not constitute and are not intended to constitute a complete list of the infamous acts which calls for disciplinary action, and that by issuing this notice the Medical Council of India and or State Medical Councils are in no way precluded from considering and dealing with any other form of professional misconduct on the part of a registered practitioner.
Circumstances may and do arise from time to time in relation to which there may occur questions of professional misconduct which do not come within any of these categories.
Every care should be taken that the code is not violated in letter or spirit.
In such instances as in all others, the Medical Council of India and or State Medical Councils have to consider and decide upon the facts brought before the Medical Council of India and or State Medical Councils.
8.2 It is made clear that any complaint with regard to professional misconduct can be brought before the appropriate Medical Council for Disciplinary action.
Upon receipt of any complaint of professional misconduct, the appropriate Medical Council would hold an enquiry and give opportunity to the registered medical practitioner to be heard in person or by pleader.
If the medical practitioner is found to be guilty of committing professional misconduct, the appropriate Medical Council may award such punishment as deemed necessary or may direct the removal altogether or for a specified period, from the register of the name of the delinquent registered practitioner.
Deletion from the Register shall be widely publicized in local press as well as in the publications of different Medical Associations Societies Bodies.
8.3
In case the punishment of removal from the register is for a limited period, the appropriate Council may also direct that the name so removed shall be restored in the register after the expiry of the period for which the name was ordered to be removed.
8.4 Decision on complaint against delinquent physician shall be taken within a time limit of 6 months.
8.5
During the pendency of the complaint the appropriate Council may restrain the physician from performing the procedure or practice which is under scrutiny.
8.6 Professional incompetence shall be judged by peer group as per guidelines prescribed by Medical Council of India.
11.1.3
The IMC Regulations framed by the Medical Council of India are binding on all medical professionals, who are under a statutory obligation to provide medical records to the patients or their attendants.
All hospitals, whether Government or private are liable to maintain the medical records, and provide the same to patient or their attendants within 72 hours of the request.
11.1.4
The Delhi Medical Council vide Circular No. DMC DHS F.5/2/2009 dated 15.05.2009 casts a statutory obligation on all registered medical practitioners and hospitals nursing homes to strictly adhere to Regulation 1.3.2 of the IMC Regulations.
The failure to comply with the same would constitute professional misconduct and entail disciplinary action.
11.1.5
This Court in Federation of Obstetrics Gynaecological Societies of India v. Union of India (2019) 6 SCC 283 held that considering the nature of services rendered by medical professionals, proper maintenance of records is an integral part of the medical services.
11.1.6
The Respondent No.2Complainant submitted that she had made several requests for being provided the in patient records for further evaluation examination of the baby, which was not made available to her for over 2 years after his discharge in April 2005 from the Appellant No.1 Hospital.
Respondent No.2Complainant had to run from one hospital to another so as to ascertain why her son had abnormal visual responses.
Despite repeated requests, the Medical Records were withheld by the Hospital.
The Respondent No.2Complainant had a legal notice issued on 24.02.2007 to the Appellant No.1 Hospital requesting for the entire inpatient medical record of her child, and made a complaint to the Delhi Medical Council.
The Appellant No.1 Hospital eventually provided the medical record on 14.06.2007.
11.1.7
The Delhi Medical Council vide Order dated 14.12.2007 issued a warning to the Appellant No.1 Hospital for the delay in supplying the medical records of Respondent No.1 to the Complainant.
We find that withholding the medical records of Respondent No.1, who was a premature baby, for a period of over 2 years, would constitute grave professional misconduct under Regulation 7, apart from being a gross deficiency in service on the part of the Appellant No.1Hospital and its management.
11.2 Failure to diagnose Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is one of the major emerging causes of childhood blindness.
A premature baby is not born with ROP.
At the time of birth, particularly in the case of premature babies, the retina is immature, which is natural at this stage.
It is the postnatal developments in the retinal vessels which could lead to ROP.
11.2.1
As per medical literature, all infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 grams, or gestational age of less than 32 weeks, are required to be mandatorily screened for ROP, which usually takes about 4 to 5 weeks to be diagnosed.
The routine screening should begin no later than 4 weeks after birth, and possibly even earlier for infants at higher risk (2 to 3 weeks).
The standard of care is to be judged in the light of the protocols and standard procedures prevailing on the date of birth, and not on the date of trial.

11.2.2 In Programme Planning and Screening Strategy in Retinopathy of Prematurity Subhadra Jalali, MS Raj Anand, MS Harsh Kumar, MD Mangat R Dogra, MS Rajvardhan Azad, MD,FRCS (Ed) Lingam Gopal, MS, Programme Planning and Screening Strategy in Retinopathy of Prematurity, Indian J Ophthalmol 2003 (March 2003), Vol. 51, Pages 8999 , published in March 2003 coauthored by Drs.
Subhadra Jalali, MS Raj Anand, MS Harsh Kumar, MD Mangat R Dogra, MS Rajvardhan Azad, MD,FRCS (Ed) Lingam Gopal, MS have opined that There are several compelling reasons to have a screening programme for ROP.
Firstly, the premature child is not born with ROP and retinal disease is not present at birth.
Each prematurely born child has a potential for normal vision, even if the retina is immature at birth.
Screening for ROP aims to identify those infants who have reached or have the potential to reach threshold ROP, which if untreated, may cause blindness or visual impairment.
This has medicolegal implications.
There are indefensible legal repercussions should an infant develop ROP and retinal detachment, but had not received eye examination.
Secondly, the grief and the personal tragedy for the family is tremendous, besides the economic burden of such childhood blindness.
The aim of screening premature babies for ROP is to detect all treatable neonates, with minimal expense of time and resources.
This also aims at not screening those babies who are unlikely to get a severe form of ROP.
Early recognition of ROP by screening provides an opportunity for effective treatment.
The criteria for screening babies are based on two critical factors the birth weight and the gestational age.
emphasis supplied A well organised screening strategy and timely intervention can to a large extent prevent blindness due to ROP.
Extensive clinical trials and publications have established that among other factors, gestation period and low birth weight are critical in the pathophysiology of ROP.
If detected early and treated with peripheral retinal cryopexy or laser, ROP blindness can be prevented to some extent.
Once the case crosses Stage 3, in very few cases can the sight be saved even by extensive vitreoretinal surgery.
11.2.3
This Court considered this issue in a similar case in V. Krishnakumar v. State of Tamil Nadu (2015) 9 SCC 388 (2015) 4 SCC (Civ) 546 .
In that case, a premature female baby was born in the 29 th week of pregnancy.
The infant weighed only 1.25 kgs at birth.
The doctors failed to examine the baby for ROP, or advise the parents that the baby was required to be seen by a paediatric ophthalmologist since there was a possibility of occurrence of ROP, so as to avert permanent blindness.
The discharge summary neither disclosed a warning to the infants parents of the possibility that the infant might develop ROP for which certain precautions must be taken, nor any signs that the doctors were themselves cautious of the dangers of development of ROP.
The doctors attempted to cover up their gross negligence of not having examined the infant for the onset of ROP, which is a standard precaution for a wellknown condition in such a case.
This Court after reviewing and analysing the medical literature on ROP, observed that the problem occurs in infants who are prematurely born, and who have been administered oxygen and blood transfusion upon birth.
If detected during early stages, it can be prevented.
In para 4 of the judgment, this Court held that 4. .It is said that prematurity is one of the most common causes of blindness and is caused by an initial constriction and then rapid growth of blood vessels in the retina.
When the blood vessels leak, they cause scarring.
These scars can later shrink and pull on the retina, sometimes detaching it.
The disease advances in severity through five stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (5 being the terminal stage).
Medical literature suggests that Stage 3 can be treated by Laser or Cryotherapy treatment in order to eliminate the abnormal vessels.
Even in Stage 4, in some cases, the central retina or macula remains intact thereby keeping intact the central vision.
When the disease is allowed to progress to Stage 5, there is a total detachment and the retina becomes funnel shaped leading to blindness.
There is ample medical literature on the subject.
It is, however, not necessary to refer all of it.
Some material relevant to the need for checkup for ROP for an infant is All infants with a birth weight less than 1500 gm or gestational age less than 32 weeks are required to be screened for ROP.
AIIMS Report dated 2182007 5.
It is undisputed that the relationship of birth weight and gestational age to ROP as reproduced in NCDRCs order is as follows Most ROP is seen in very low birth weight infants, and the incidence is inversely related to birth weight and gestational age.
About 7080 of infants with birth weight less than 1000 gm show acute changes, whereas above 1500 gm birth weight the frequency falls to less than 10.6. .
It is further observed that ROP is a visually devastative disease that often can be treated successfully if it is diagnosed in time.
emphasis supplied This Court relied upon a Report dated 21.08.2007 of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi comprising of five members, of which, four were ophthalmological specialists.
The Board opined as under A premature infant is not born with Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), the retina though immature is normal for this age.
The ROP usually starts developing 24 weeks after birth when it is mandatory to do the first screening of the child.
The current guidelines are to examine and screen the babies with birth weight1500 gm and 32 weeks gestational age, starting at 31 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) or 4 weeks after birth, whichever is later.
Around a decade ago, the guidelines in general were the same and the premature babies were first examined at 31 33 weeks postconceptional age or 26 weeks after birth.
There is a general agreement on these above guidelines on a national and international level.
The attached annexure explains some authoritative resources and guidelines published in national and international literature especially over the last decade.
However, in spite of ongoing interest world over in screening and management of ROP and advancing knowledge, it may not be possible to exactly predict which premature baby will develop ROP and to what extent and why.
emphasis supplied On a review of the literature on ROP, the Supreme Court in V. Krishnakumar (supra) set out the screening guidelines as follows table
This Court observed that ROP starts developing 2 to 4 weeks after birth when it is mandatory to do the first screening of the child.
As per the report of AIIMS it may not be possible to exactly predict which premature baby will develop ROP and to what extent and why .
This would necessitate the need for a checkup in all such cases.
11.2.4 It is clear from the above medical literature that ROP is a visually progressive disease, which can be treated successfully if it is diagnosed on time.
ROP advances through 5 stages.
Medical literature suggests that Stage 3 can be treated by Laser or Cryotherapy treatment in order to eliminate the abnormal vessels.
Even at Stage 4, in some cases, the central retina or macula remains intact thereby keeping intact the central vision.
When the disease progresses to Stage 5, there is a total detachment, and the retina becomes funnel shaped, leading to blindness.
11.2.5
We have carefully perused the original Medical Records of the Appellant No.1Hospital, which were provided in a sealed cover to the Court.
We find that there is an entry at Page 100 of the medical records dated 25.04.2005 recorded at 900 a.m. which reads as under 25/4/059 AM StableWt 1.56 kgAccepting cup feedsS E NAD D19 of Inj AmphocanPlan for Discharge tomorrowAdv Breast feeds Cont.

The said noting is signed by Dr. S.N. Jha Appellant No.4.
There is, however, no time mentioned against this noting.
A visual examination of the original medical records Treatment Sheet shows that this entry is not recorded in the same sequence as all previous and subsequent notings.
The entries recorded at Page 100 and Page 102 have been made at the bottom of the page.
The date 26/4 is mentioned in a different column, unlike the other entries made before and after this entry.
There is no time of the ophthalmological examination by Appellant No.4Dr.
S.N. Jha on 26.04.2005 mentioned in the record, unlike all other notings by other doctors, who have examined the patient, where the time is clearly recorded.
On the next page i.e. page 103 of the medical record, it is mentioned as Day 28 i.e. 26.04.2005 on the top of the page.
The first entry on that date is recorded at 10.30 am.
This would indicate that the baby was not examined prior to 10.30 a.m. by any doctor.
There is no contemporaneous record to corroborate that ROP screening was done by Appellant No.4 on 26.04.2005.
The Nurses Daily Record or Treatment Sheet do not mention that the dilation of the pupils of the baby were carried out by administration of Cyclopentolate (0.5) and Phenylephrine (2.5) drops to conduct test of ROP.
We had orally enquired from the learned counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant No.4 Dr. S.N. Jha about the approximate time at which the ROP checkup was done by him on 26.04.2005.
The counsel was unable to specify the time at which the baby was examined by him.
11.2.6
The Respondent No.1baby was discharged on 29.04.2005.
The Complainants were provided with a Discharge Slip.
The Discharge Slip does not contain any advice for a mandatory followup for ROP.
Rather, the Discharge Slip only advised the Complainant to bring the Respondent No.1 for a review to the Paediatrics OPD on Wednesday or Saturday at 4 P.M. 11.2.7 The Counsel for the Hospital and the Doctors contended that postdischarge, the Respondent No.2Complainant did not bring the baby to the speciality Paediatric OPD for a check up as advised in the Discharge Summary.
11.2.8
We have seen the original medical records produced by the Appellant No.1Hospital, and find that on both occasions, i.e. 04.05.2005 and 13.07.2005, the Complainants went correctly to the Paediatrics Unit of the General OPD.
Hence, the contention of the Appellants is liable to rejected as being completely baseless.
11.2.9
The Complainant took the baby for a follow up checkup postdischarge to the PaediatricsIII Department on two occasions i.e. 04.05.2005 and 13.07.2005.
The baby was examined by Appellants No. 2 and 3 on 04.05.2005.
In the Treatment Sheet, there is no recommendation to have ROP test done, nor was the patient advised to come back after two weeks.

It is thus abundantly clear that the baby was rightly taken to the Paediatrics Unit of the General OPD Clinic at the chronological age of 4 to 5 weeks, when the onset of ROP could have been detected.
However, there was no advice given by the treating doctors i.e. Appellants Nos. 2 and 3 the Consultant Paediatricians, nor the Appellant No.4 Ophthalmologist to conduct the ROP test.
11.2.10 We find that the ROP was neither advised, nor carried out at all by the Appellant No.1Hospital, or Appellant No.4Dr.
S.N. Jha, the Senior Ophthalmologist, throughout the period of hospitalisation of the baby, or even after discharge.
The baby was born in the 32 nd gestational week, and was 1.49 kgs at birth.
As per standard protocol, the ROP screening ought to have been done between 34 weeks from birth.
The baby remained admitted for 27 days in the Hospital from 02.04.2005 to 29.04.2005.
There is no justification whatsoever why the mandatory screening of ROP was not done for the baby, while he was under the direct care and supervision of the Appellants.
We affirm the findings of the National Commission of gross negligence by the Appellant Nos. 2 to 4Doctors, and deficiency of service by the Appellant No.1 Hospital.
11.3 Report of the Medical Board constituted by AIIMS 11.3.1 A perusal of the AIIMS Report 11.05.2012 shows that it was premised on the alleged entry recorded by Appellant No.4  Dr. S.N. Jha on 26.04.2005, which records that ROP test was conducted, and no ROP was detected.
We have already recorded a finding that the entry made in the Treatment Sheet (at pages 100 and 102 of the original Medical Records) seems to be an interpolation done subsequently to cover up the failure of the Hospital and the Doctors to advise or conduct the mandatory ROP checkup and followup protocol.
The second point contained in the AIIMS Report that the baby was not taken to the Paediatrics OPD is wholly fallacious.
We have seen the medical records, and find that the baby was, in fact, taken to the Paediatrics Unit of the General OPD.
Hence, the basis of the Report is misconceived, and cannot be relied upon.
11.3.2
It is wellsettled that a court is not bound by the evidence of an expert, which is advisory in nature.
The court must derive its own conclusions after carefully sifting through the medical records, and whether the standard protocol was followed in the treatment of the patient.
The duty of an expert witness is to furnish the Court with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of the conclusions, so as to enable the Court to form an independent opinion by the application of this criteria to the facts proved by the evidence of the case.

Jha, the senior Ophthalmologist attached to the Appellant No.1Hospital.
The Appellant No.1  Hospital and the Appellants Nos. 24  Doctors have failed to satisfy the Court that ROP tests were conducted at any point of time, or that the Complainants were even advised to get the ROP test done.
11.4 Medical Negligence and Duty of Care
11.4.1
Medical negligence comprises of the following constituents (1) A legal duty to exercise due care on the part of the medical professional (2) failure to inform the patient of the risks involved (3) the patient suffers damage as a consequence of the undisclosed risk by the medical professional (4) if the risk had been disclosed, the patient would have avoided the injury (5) breach of the said duty would give rise to an actionable claim of negligence.
The cause of action for negligence arises only when damage occurs, since damage is a necessary ingredient of this tort.
In a complaint of medical negligence, the burden is on the complainant to prove breach of duty, injury and causation.
The injury must be sufficiently proximate to the medical practitioners breach of duty.
In the absence of evidence to the contrary adduced by the opposite party, an inference of causation may be drawn even though positive or scientific proof is lacking.
Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education Research v. Jaspal Singh, (2009) 7 SCC 330 (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 399 (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 114 11.4.2 Medical negligence is the breach of a duty of care by an act of omission or commission by a medical professional of ordinary prudence.
Actionable medical negligence is the neglect in exercising a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge to the patient, to whom he owes a duty of care, which has resulted in injury to such person.
The standard to be applied for adjudging whether the medical professional charged has been negligent or not, in the performance of his duty, would be that of an ordinary competent person exercising ordinary skill in the profession.
The law requires neither the very highest nor a very low degree of care and competence to adjudge whether the medical professional has been negligent in the treatment of the patient.
Refer to Laxman Balkrishna Joshi (Dr.) v. Dr. Trimbak Bapu Godbole, (1969) 1
SCR 206 AIR 1969 SC 128 Kusum Sharma v. Batra Hospital (2010) 3 SCC 480 (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 1127 (2010) 1 SCC (Civ) 747 11.4.3
The degree of skill and care required by a medical practitioner stated in Halsburys Laws of England 4th Edn., Vol. 26 pp.
1718 4th Edition, Vol.30, Para 35 is as follows 22.
Negligence.
Duties owed to patient.
A person who holds himself out as ready to give medical advice or treatment impliedly undertakes that he is possessed of skill and knowledge for the purpose.
Such a person, whether he is a registered medical practitioner or not, who is consulted by a patient, owes him certain duties, namely, a duty of care in deciding whether to undertake the case a duty of care in deciding what treatment to give and a duty of care in his administration of that treatment.
A breach of any of these duties will support an action for negligence by the patient.
35. Degree of skill and care required.
To establish liability on that basis it must be shown (1) that there is a usual and normal practice (2) that the defendant has not adopted it and (3) that the course in fact adopted is one no professional man of ordinary skill would have taken had he been acting with ordinary care.
emphasis supplied 11.4.4 Lord Denning, in Hucks v. Cole (1968) 118
New LJ 469 followed in Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education Research v. Jaspal Singh, (2009) 7 SCC 330 (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 399 (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 114 , held that a medical practitioner would be liable only where his conduct falls below the standards of a reasonably competent practitioner in his field.
11.4.5
In earlier judgments, this Court referred to the Bolam test laid down in Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee, (1957) 1 WLR 582 (1957) 2
All ER 118 .
In this case, the doctor treating the patient suffering from mental illness was held not to be guilty of medical negligence by the Queens Bench Division for failure to administer musclerelaxant drugs and using physical restraint in the course of electroconvulsive therapy.
McNair, J., in his opinion, explained the law in the following words (WLR p. 586) where you get a situation which involves the use of some special skill or competence, then the test as to whether there has been negligence or not is not the test of the man on the top of a Clapham omnibus, because he has not got this special skill.
The test is the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have that special skill.
A man need not possess the highest expert skill it is well established law that it is sufficient if he exercises the ordinary skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that particular art.
emphasis supplied The ratio of the Bolam case is that it is enough for the doctor to show that the standard of care and the skill exercised by him was that of an ordinary competent medical practitioner exercising an ordinary degree of professional skill.
McNair, J., held that (WLR.
P 587) he a Doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art.
11.4.6
In the subsequent judgment rendered in Eckersley v. Binnie (1988) 18
Con LR 1 followed in Jacob Mathew v. State of Punjab, (2005) 6 SCC 1 2005 SCC (Cri) 1369
S.K. Jhunjhunwala v. Dhanwanti Kaur, (2019) 2 SCC 28 , Bingham, L.J. explained the Bolam test in the following words (Con LR p. 79) From these general statements it follows that a professional man should command the corpus of knowledge which forms part of the professional equipment of the ordinary member of his profession.
He should not lag behind other ordinary assiduous and intelligent members of his profession in the knowledge of new advances, discoveries and developments in his field.
He should have such an awareness as an ordinarily competent practitioner would have of the deficiencies in his knowledge and the limitations on his skill.
He should be alert to the hazards and risks in any professional task he undertakes to the extent that other ordinarily competent members of the profession would be alert.
He must bring to any professional task he undertakes no less expertise, skill and care than other ordinarily competent members of his profession would bring, but need bring no more.
The standard is that of the reasonable average.
The law does not require of a professional man that he be a paragon combining the qualities of polymath and prophet.
(Charlesworth Percy, ibid., para 8.04) emphasis supplied A medical professional should be alert to the hazards and risks in any professional task he undertakes to the extent that other ordinarily competent members of the profession would be alert.
He must bring to any professional task he undertakes reasonable skill that other ordinarily competent members of his profession would bring.
11.4.7
This Court followed the Bolam test in Jacob Mathew v. State of Punjab 19 wherein it was held that the Bolam test has been widely accepted as decisive of the standard of care required by medical practitioners, and it is invariably cited with approval before the courts in India, and applied as a touchstone to test the pleas of medical negligence.
The court summed up the law on medical negligence in the following words 48.
(1) Negligence is the breach of a duty caused by omission to do something which a reasonable man guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.
The definition of negligence as given in Law of Torts, Ratanlal Dhirajlal (edited by Justice G.P. Singh), referred to hereinabove, holds good.
Negligence becomes actionable on account of injury resulting from the act or omission amounting to negligence attributable to the person sued.
The essential components of negligence are three duty, breach and resulting damage.
(2) Negligence in the context of the medical profession necessarily calls for a treatment with a difference.
To infer rashness or negligence on the part of a professional, in particular a doctor, additional considerations apply.
A case of occupational negligence is different from one of professional negligence.
A simple lack of care, an error of judgment or an accident, is not proof of negligence on the part of a medical professional.
So long as a doctor follows a practice acceptable to the medical profession of that day, he cannot be held liable for negligence merely because a better alternative course or method of treatment was also available or simply because a more skilled doctor would not have chosen to follow or resort to that practice or procedure which the accused followed.
When it comes to the failure of taking precautions, what has to be seen is whether those precautions were taken which the ordinary experience of men has found to be sufficient a failure to use special or extraordinary precautions which might have prevented the particular happening cannot be the standard for judging the alleged negligence.
So also, the standard of care, while assessing the practice as adopted, is judged in the light of knowledge available at the time of the incident, and not at the date of trial.
Similarly, when the charge of negligence arises out of failure to use some particular equipment, the charge would fail if the equipment was not generally available at that particular time (that is, the time of the incident) at which it is suggested it should have been used.
(3) A professional may be held liable for negligence on one of the two findings either he was not possessed of the requisite skill which he professed to have possessed, or, he did not exercise, with reasonable competence in the given case, the skill which he did possess.
The standard to be applied for judging, whether the person charged has been negligent or not, would be that of an ordinary competent person exercising ordinary skill in that profession.
It is not possible for every professional to possess the highest level of expertise or skills in that branch which he practices.
A highly skilled professional may be possessed of better qualities, but that cannot be made the basis or the yardstick for judging the performance of the professional proceeded against on indictment of negligence.
(4) The test for determining medical negligence as laid down in Bolam case (1957) 1
WLR 582 (1957) 2
All ER 118 holds good in its applicability in India.
emphasis supplied 11.4.8
In recent years, the Bolam test has been discarded by the courts in England.
In Bolitho v. City and Hackney Health Authority (1998) 1 AC 232 (1997) 3 WLR 1151 (1997) 4 All ER 771 (HL) , a five judge bench of the House of Lords ruled that (AC pp.
241 GH and 242 AB) the court is not bound to hold that a defendant doctor escapes liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just because he leads evidence from a number of medical experts who are genuinely of opinion that the defendants treatment or diagnosis accorded with sound medical practice.
In the Bolam 1957 1 W.L.R. 583, 587 case itself, McNair J. stated that the defendant had to have acted in accordance with the practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men.
Later, he referred to a standard of practice recognised as proper by a competent reasonable body of opinion.
Again, in the passage which I have cited from Maynards 1984 1 W.L.R. 634, 639 case, Lord Scarman refers to a respectable body of professional opinion.
The use of these adjectivesresponsible, reasonable and respectableall show that the court has to be satisfied that the exponents of the body of opinion relied upon can demonstrate that such opinion has a logical basis.
In particular in cases involving, as they so often do, the weighing of risks against benefits, the judge before accepting a body of opinion as being responsible, reasonable or respectable, will need to be satisfied that, in forming their views, the experts have directed their minds to the question of comparative risks and benefits and have reached a defensible conclusion on the matter.
emphasis supplied Lord BrowneWilkinson, speaking for the bench, in his opinion stated that despite a body of professional opinion approving the doctors conduct, a doctor can be held liable for negligence, if it is demonstrated that the professional opinion is not capable of withstanding logical analysis(AC p.243 AE)
These decisions demonstrate that in cases of diagnosis and treatment there are cases where, despite a body of professional opinion sanctioning the defendants conduct, the defendant can properly be held liable for negligence (I am not here considering questions of disclosure of risk).
In my judgment that is because, in some cases, it cannot be demonstrated to the judges satisfaction that the body of opinion relied upon is reasonable or responsible.
In the vast majority of cases the fact that distinguished experts in the field are of a particular opinion will demonstrate the reasonableness of that opinion.
In particular, where there are questions of assessment of the relative risks and benefits of adopting a particular medical practice, a reasonable view necessarily presupposes that the relative risks and benefits have been weighed by the experts in forming their opinions.
But if, in a rare case, it can be demonstrated that the professional opinion is not capable of withstanding logical analysis, the judge is entitled to hold that the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible.
emphasis supplied 11.4.9 A five judge bench of the Australian High Court in Rogers v. Whitaker (1992) 109
Aus LR 625 1992HCA 58 identified the basic flaw involved in approaching the standard of duty of care of a doctor as laid down in Bolam (supra), and held that 5.
.The law imposes on a medical practitioner a duty to exercise reasonable care and skill in the provision of professional advice and treatment.
That duty is a single comprehensive duty covering all the ways in which a doctor is called upon to exercise his skill and judgment Sidaway v. Governors of Bethlem Royal Hospital 1985 UKHL 1 (1985)
AC 871 it extends to the examination, diagnosis and treatment of the patient and the provision of information.

In Australia, it has been accepted that the standard of care to be observed by a person with some special skill or competence is that of the ordinary skilled person exercising and professing to have that special skill.
Cook v. Cook 1986 HCA 73 (1986) 162 CLR 376, at pp 383384 Papatonakis v. Australian Telecommunications Commission 1985 HCA 3 (1985) 156 CLR 7, at p 36 Weber v. Land Agents Board (1986) 40 SASR 312, at p 316 Lewis v. Tressider Andrews Associates Pty. Ltd. (1987) 2 Qd R 533.
But, that standard is not determined solely or even primarily by reference to the practice followed or supported by a responsible body of opinion in the relevant profession or trade.
Florida Hotels Pty. Ltd. v. Mayo 1965
HCA 26 (1965) 113 CLR 588)
Even in the sphere of diagnosis and treatment, the heartland of the skilled medical practitioner, the Bolam principle has not always been applied.
Albrighton v. Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (1980) 2 NSWLR 542 E v. Australian Red Cross 1991 FCA 20 (1991) 99 ALR 601) Further, and more importantly, particularly in the field of nondisclosure of risk and the provision of advice and information, the Bolam principle has been discarded and, instead, the courts have adopted the principle that, while evidence of acceptable medical practice is a useful guide for the courts, it is for the courts to adjudicate on what is the appropriate standard of care after giving weight to the paramount consideration that a person is entitled to make his own decisions about his life.
emphasis supplied 11.4.10 A sevenjudge bench of the U.K. Supreme Court in a more recent judgment delivered in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board 2015 UKSC 11 traced the changes in the jurisprudence of medical negligence in England, and held thatpatients are now widely regarded as persons holding rights, rather than as the passive recipients of the care of the medical profession The Supreme Court noted that the courts have tacitly ceased to apply the Bolam test in relation to the advice given by the doctor to their patients.
The Court summed up the law on medical negligence in the following words 82.
In the law of negligence, this approach entails a duty on the part of doctors to take reasonable care to ensure that a patient is aware of material risks of injury that are inherent in treatment.
This can be understood, within the traditional framework of negligence, as a duty of care to avoid exposing a person to a risk of injury which she would otherwise have avoided, but it is also the counterpart of the patients entitlement to decide whether or not to incur that risk.
The existence of that entitlement, and the fact that its exercise does not depend exclusively on medical considerations, are important.
They point to a fundamental distinction between, on the one hand, the doctors role when considering possible investigatory or treatment options and, on the other, her role in discussing with the patient any recommended treatment and possible alternatives, and the risks of injury which may be involved.
87.
The correct position, in relation to the risks of injury involved in treatment, can now be seen to be substantially that adopted in Sidaway by Lord Scarman, and by Lord Woolf MR in Pearce, subject to the refinement made by the High Court of Australia in Rogers v Whitaker, which we have discussed at paras 7773.
An adult person of sound mind is entitled to decide which, if any, of the available forms of treatment to undergo, and her consent must be obtained before treatment interfering with her bodily integrity is undertaken.
The doctor is therefore under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments.
The test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patients position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should reasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it.
emphasis supplied 11.4.11 This Court in V. Kishan Rao v. Nikhil Super Speciality Hospital (2010) 5 SCC 513 (2010) 2 SCC (Civ) 460 has opined that the Bolam test requires re consideration.
A.K. Ganguly, J. speaking for this Court, observed that 23.
Even though Bolam test was accepted by this Court as providing the standard norms in cases of medical negligence, in the country of its origin, it is questioned on various grounds.
It has been found that the inherent danger in Bolam test is that if the courts defer too readily to expert evidence medical standards would obviously decline.
Michael Jones in his treatise on Medical Negligence (Sweet and Maxwell), 4th Edn., 2008 criticised the Bolam test as it opts for the lowest common denominator.
The learned author noted that opinion was gaining ground in England that Bolam test should be restricted to those cases where an adverse result follows a course of treatment which has been intentional and has been shown to benefit other patients previously.
This should not be extended to certain types of medical accidents merely on the basis of how common they are.
It is felt to do this would set us on the slippery slope of excusing carelessness when it happens often enough (see Michael Jones on Medical Negligence, para 3039 at p. 246).
25.
Even though Bolam test has not been uprooted it has come under some criticism as has been noted in Jackson Powell on Professional Negligence (Sweet and Maxwell), 5th Edn., 2002.
The learned authors have noted (see para 7047 at p. 200 in Professional Negligence) that there is an argument to the effect that Bolam test is inconsistent with the right to life unless the domestic courts construe that the requirement to take reasonable care is equivalent with the requirement of making adequate provision for medical care.
In the context of such jurisprudential thinking in England, time has come for this Court also to reconsider the parameters set down in Bolam test as a guide to decide cases on medical negligence and specially in view of Article 21 of our Constitution which encompasses within its guarantee, a right to medical treatment and medical care.
26.
In England, Bolam test is now considered merely a rule of practice or of evidence.
It is not a rule of law (see para 1.60 in Clinical Negligence by Michael Powers QC, Nigel Harris and Anthony Barton, 4th Edn., Tottel Publishing).
However, as in the larger Bench of this Court in Jacob Mathew v. State of Punjab, Lahoti, C.J. has accepted Bolam test as correctly laying down the standards for judging cases of medical negligence, we follow the same and refuse to depart from it.
emphasis supplied 11.4.12 More recently, this Court in Arun Kumar Manglik v. Chirayu Health and Medicare (P) Ltd. (2019) 7 SCC 401 has held that the standard of care as enunciated in Bolam (supra) must evolve in consonance with its subsequent interpretation adopted by English and Indian courts.
11.4.13 Applying the aforesaid principles to the facts of the present case, Appellant Nos. 2 and 3 viz.
Dr. G.S. Kochhar and Dr. Naveen Jain, the Consultant Paediatricians, undoubtedly possessed the skill and qualifications of a Paediatrician, and the baby was placed under their direct care and treatment from birth till he was 3 months old.
They owed a duty of care to the baby and his parents.
Appellant No.4 Dr. S.N. Jha, the Senior Consultant Ophthalmologist, who was engaged by the Appellant No.1 Hospital, and was the specialist in the Ophthalmology Department, ought to have followed the standard protocol for screening the Respondent No.1baby for ROP, which is prescribed at the chronological age of 3 to 4 weeks after birth.
11.4.14 Appellant Nos.1 to 3 are liable for medical negligence since at no stage were the parents of Complainant No.1 either advised or guided about the possibility of occurrence of ROP in a premature baby, nor was the baby examined by Appellant No.4, the Ophthalmologist as per standard protocol.
The doctors ought to have been fully aware of the high chances of occurrence of ROP in a preterm baby.
The lack of care constitutes a gross deficiency in service.
After discharge on 29.04.2005, the baby was brought on 04.05.2005 at the chronological age of 5 weeks.
Even on this date, no ROP test was either advised or conducted.
The baby was brought for a further follow up checkup on 13.07.2005, by which time the baby was 3 months old.
Even on this visit, the Appellants did not advise or guide the Respondent No.2Complainant to have the ROP test conducted.
11.4.15 After reviewing the medical literature setting out the contemporaneous standards and established protocols on ROP, the reasonable standard of care for a premature baby, mandates screening and checking up for ROP.
It is a medically accepted position that ROP is a reversible disease, if diagnosed up to Stage 3.
Had the ROP test been conducted by the Appellants, there would have been timely detection of the onset of ROP, which at that stage would have been reversible.
On account of the negligence of the Appellants 2 to 4, the disease remained undiagnosed.
It came to be diagnosed on 03.12.2005, when the baby was 8 months old, by Shroff Charity Eye Hospital.
By this time, the ROP had reached Stage 5, when it becomes irreversible leading to total blindness of the Respondent No.1 baby.
11.4.16
We affirm the findings of the National Commission to hold that the Appellant No.1Hospital, Appellant Nos. 2 and 3 the Paediatricians, and Appellant No.4 Dr. S.N. Jha, the Senior Ophthalmologist, owed a legal duty of care to the Complainants Respondents No.1 and 2.
The failure to inform the Respondent No.2mother of the necessity to have the ROP test conducted in the case of a preterm baby, and the high risk involved which could lead to total blindness, was a breach of duty.
Furthermore, the failure to carry out the ROP test, which is mandated by standard protocol, while the baby was under their direct care and supervision from birth till he was 3 months old, amounted to gross negligence by the Doctors, and deficiency of service by the Hospital.
The consequential damage caused to the baby by not having conducted the mandatory ROP test, which led to the total blindess of the baby, has given rise to an actionable claim of negligence.
11.4.17 It is well established that a hospital is vicariously liable for the acts of negligence committed by the doctors engaged or empanelled to provide medical care.
Savita Garg v. National Heart Institute (2004) 8 SCC 56 Balram Prasad (2014) 1 SCC 384 (2014) 1 SCC (Civ) 327 Achutrao Haribhau Khodwa v. State of Maharashtra (1996) 2 SCC 634 V. Krishnakumar v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2015) 9 SCC 388 (2015) 4 SCC (Civ) 546
It is common experience that when a patient goes to a hospital, he she goes there on account of the reputation of the hospital, and with the hope that due and proper care will be taken by the hospital authorities.
Savita Garg v. National Heart Institute (2004) 8 SCC 56 (2004) 8 Scale 694
If the hospital fails to discharge their duties through their doctors, being employed on job basis or employed on contract basis, it is the hospital which has to justify the acts of commission or omission on behalf of their doctors Savita Garg v. National Heart Institute (2004) 8 SCC 56 (2004) 8 Scale 694 11.4.18 Accordingly, we hold Appellant No.1Hospital to be vicariously liable for the acts of omission and commission committed by Appellant Nos. 2 to 4.
We hold all the Appellants as being jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Complainants.
11.5 Compensation 11.5.1
Having affirmed the findings recorded by the National Commission on the question of medical negligence and deficiency in service by the Appellants, the issue whether the compensation awarded by the National Commission was just and reasonable is required to be determined.
The Complainants had claimed Rs.
1,30,25,000/ as compensation before the National Commission.
The National Commission vide the Impugned Judgment awarded a total sum of Rs.
64,00,000/ to the Complainants along with interest.
11.5.2
This Court vide Order dated 06.11.2019 directed the Appellants to release a sum of Rs.5,00,000/ (Rupees Five Lakhs) in favour of the Respondent No.2Complainant from the amount lying deposited by the Appellant No.1Hospital in the Court.
This Court further directed the Complainant Respondent No.2 to file an affidavit regarding the education received by the Respondent No.1, and the level of proficiency he had attained.
11.5.3
Accordingly, the Respondent No.2 Complainant has stated on affidavit that the Respondent No.1, who is now 14 years old, was studying in a Government Senior Secondary School for Blind Boys, Kingsway Camp from 2013 to 2017, and barely received education for 4 years, up to 5 th standard.
The Respondent No.1 was forced to leave school since the Respondent No.2Complainant was unable to bear his educational, cocurricular and transportation expenses.
The father of Respondent No.1, who was working as a security guard with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, had expired in 2013.
The Respondent No.2Complainant stated that she is currently employed as a parttime receptionist since 2017, and earns Rs. 5,500/ per month as salary, and receives Rs. 2,500/ per month under the Delhi Vidhwa Pension Yojna.
She further stated that Respondent No.1 received Rs. 2,500/ per month under the Delhi Governments Scheme for Subsistence Allowance to Persons with Special Needs.
11.5.4
The grant of compensation to remedy the wrong of medical negligence is within the realm of law of torts.
It is based on the principle of restitutio in integrum.
The said principle provides that a person is entitled to damages which should as nearly as possible get that sum of money which would put him in the same position as he would have been if he had not sustained the wrong.
(Livingstone v. Rawyards Coal Co., (1880)
LR 5 AC 25 (HL) followed in Malay Kumar Ganguly v. Sukumar Mukherjee, (2009) 9 SCC 221 (2009) 3 SCC (Civ) 663 (2010) 2 SCC (Cri) 299 and V. Krishnakumar v. State of T.N., (2015) 9 SCC 388 (2015) 4 SCC (Civ) 546
Balram Prasad v. Kunal Saha, (2014) 1 SCC 384 (2014) 1 SCC (Civ) 327)
11.5.5
In our considered view, having regard to the finding that the medical negligence in the instant case occurred in 2005, and the litigation has been pending before this Court for over 3 years, coupled with the fact that the additional monthly expenses such as the care of an attendant nurse, educational expenses of the patient in a special school, assistive devices etc. have not been taken into account, it would serve the ends of justice if the compensation awarded by the National Commission is enhanced, by a further lumpsum amount of Rs. 12,00,000 (Rupees Twelve Lakhs).
11.5.6
