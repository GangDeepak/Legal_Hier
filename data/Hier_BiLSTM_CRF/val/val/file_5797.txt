11.
The Government of Meghalaya again issued an order dated 07.02.2019 clarifying its earlier order dated 18.01.2019.Various associations and individuals have thereafter submitted applications before State of Meghalaya and before this Court praying for permission to transport the coal.
Learned counsel appearing for the State of Meghalaya has submitted copy of a report submitted by Shri B.P. Katakey, Former Judge, Gauhati High Court dated 31.03.2019, which Committee was appointed by the National Green Tribunal by its order dated 31.08.2018.Learned counsel for the State submits that the Committee in the said report dated 31.03.2019 has dealt with transportation of coal in Para O.It is relevant to extract Para O of the report, which is to the following effect O. Coal mining activities including transportation of coal.
The Honble Supreme Court, vide its order dated 04.12.2018, initially allowed transportation of coal upto 31.03.2019, on the basis of the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the State of Meghalaya that 1,76,655 MTs of coal is available for transportation.
The Honble Supreme Court, however, by subsequent order dated 15.01.2019, directed that there would not be any transportation of any coal lying on the sites.
In the order dated 19.02.2019, the Honble Supreme Court has noticed filing of various interlocutory applications for allowing transportation of already mined coal.
The Committee has been informed by the Commissioner Secretary to the Government of Meghalaya, Mining Geology Department that the order dated 15.01.2019 passed by the Honble Supreme Court is still in force.
The Committee, having regard to the aforesaid orders passed by the Honble Supreme Court, directed the Mining Geology Department of the Government of Meghalaya to submit a report about the quantity of coal for which challans for transportation has been issued between 04.12.2018 to 15.01.2019 and the quantity of coal already transported from the State of Meghalaya.
The Commissioner Secretary to the Government of Meghalaya, Mining Geology Department has apprised the Committee that challans for transportation of 1,69,149 MTs of coal have been issued, pursuant to which 94,099 MTs of coal have been transported out of the State of Meghalaya between 04.12.2018 to 15.01.2019, leaving 75,050 MTs of Coal still to be transported, in respect of which the challans have already been issued.
The Committee has also directed the Deputy Commissioner of East Jaintia Hills District to submit a report on a news item titled Four died as coal laden truck capsized in EJHappeared in the Shillong Edition of a local daily, namely,Shillong Times, in its publication dated 12.03.2019.
The Deputy Commissioner has submitted a report dated 20.03.2019 before the Committee in its proceeding dated 25.03.2019 admitting that an accident has occurred on 11.03.2019 involving a truck carrying coal and in that accident, 4(four) persons died and 4(four) persons received injuries.
From the aforesaid admitted position, it is, therefore, evident that despite the order passed by the Honble Supreme Court prohibiting transportation of coal, such transportation is going on which has not been stopped by the authorities for the reasons best known to them.
As reported in various newspapers, illegal coal mining activities are also going on despite the ban by the Honble NGT. 12.
Learned counsel for the State submits that as per the aforesaid report, about 176655 MTs of coal was still to be transported, with regard to which challans for transportation had already been issued.
He further submits that the report further noticed that there were about 75050 Mts.
Of the coal for which challans for transportation had been issued, which quantity was included in 176655 MTs of coal, which was permitted to be transported by this Court on 04.12.2018.
The learned counsel for the applicants in support of different I.A.s made various submissions before us.
Some of the applicants are those, who have obtained transportation challans for transportation of coal in pursuance of the order dated 04.12.2018 and their coal was included in the quantity of 176655 MTs but could not transport due to order dated 15.01.2019.
There are other applicants, who submits that large quantity of coal has already been assessed belonging to them by the State itself and respective Deputy Commissioner.
Reference has also been made to the Technical Committee Report appointed by the State Government, which has carried out the assessment.
There are other various applicants, where applicants are seeking transport of unassessed coal.
It is submitted that all the applicants are entitled for transportation.
It is further contended that unless the transportation of coal is not permitted in the ensuing rainy season there shall be an adverse effect to the environment.
It is submitted that large quantity of coal is lying in the open, which will cause environmental pollution.
13.
Learned Amicus Curiae and Shri Nidhesh Gupta had refuted the submissions of the applicants.
It is submitted that coal, which has been sought to be now transported are all coal, which was illegally mined against the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.
It is submitted that detailed submissions have already been made before this Court establishing the illegal mining of coal.
14.
We, after having heard the counsel for the parties, are of the view that for the present, we only need to consider the applicants, which are seeking transportation in reference to order of this Court dated 04.12.2018.
The Katakey Committee Report dated 31.03.2019 has already referred to the quantity, which was permitted to be transported by order dated 04.12.2018.
The report further noticed that in pursuance of the order, challan for transport of coal was issued for 176655 MTs.
in pursuance of which 94099 Mts. of coal has already been transporte and what is left to be transported was 75050
Mts. of coal.
We notice that time for transportation of coal by order dated 04.12.2018 was still 31.01.2019 but due to an unfortunate incident, in which several labourers died in the rat hole mining, this Court stopped the transport on 15.01.2019.
We, thus, are of the view that at present, only permission, which can be granted for transportation is of 75050 Mts. of coal with regard to which transport challans have already been issued by the State of Meghalaya.
We are conscious that if permission for transport of coal is granted by this Court, there is grave danger of illegal mining.
We notice that the ban on mining has already been imposed by the National Green Tribunal, which order has not yet been interfered by this Court.
15.
We, thus, permit the transportation of the coal of 75050 Mts.
with regard to which transportation challans have already been issued.
We are further of the view that for the said transportation of quantity of 75050 Mts., the State of Meghalaya has to take necessary precaution that under the guise of this permission, no other coal is transported or mined.
The State of Meghalaya has to deliberate on the mechanism to ensure that only those, who have transport challans after order of this Court dated 04.12.2018 should be permitted to transport the coal out of the quantity of 75050 Mts.
as noted by Kateky Committee.
We further make it clear that while permitting transportation, the State authority should maintain the details of such transportation in different registers noticing (i) the information of the quantity of the coal, (ii) the details of payments, (iii) the person who is transporting the coal, (iv) the person who is owner of the coal and (v) details and date of verification certificate.
These details are necessary to be noted, since we are yet to take a decision that what further liability can be imposed on such coal, which is going to be transported under this order.
16.
The State should take appropriate precaution while granting permission for transportation and under the strength of this order, no other kind or category of coal shall be permitted to be transported.
State should entrust the duty to responsible officers of the State Government not below the rank of Deputy Commissioner to ensure compliance of this order and conditions to be fixed by the State Government.
We, thus, by this order dispose of applications seeking impleadment by permitting only intervention.
On the applications seeking directions, the orders as indicated above are passed, which applications shall await the final disposal of the applications alongwith the final decision of the case.
17.
We direct the State of Meghalaya to finalise the mechanism for ensuring verification and transportation of coal as permitted above which mechanism be finalised and publicised for the benefit of all concerned and put in place within a week from today.
The actual transportation after due verification along with a verification certificate by an Officer not the rank below than the Deputy Commissioner be permitted from 17th May, 2019 to 31st May, 2019 (15 days).
After 31st May, 2019 no transportation shall be permitted.
