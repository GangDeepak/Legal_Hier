 Leave granted.2.
The appeals have been preferred by Chhattisgarh State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (in short, the CSIDC) and
M s. Raipur Construction Pvt. Ltd. being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 14.02.2007 passed by the High Court of Chhattisgarh in Writ Petition (C) No.1053 of 2016 thereby allowing the same and quashing the contract given to M s. Raipur Construction Pvt.
Ltd. by the CSIDC with respect to the work of upgradation of infrastructure i.e. roads, drainage system and water supply in Sirgitti under Modified Industrial Infrastructure Upgradation Scheme (MIIUS) at Sirgitti, Bilaspur.3.
Tender was floated by the CSIDC on 3.11.2015 for the aforesaid work within the stipulated time period of 18 months and tenders were invited online, to be submitted by 12.01.2016.4.
A writ petition bearing WP(C) No.227 of 2016, was filed challenging the notice inviting tenders issued by the CSIDC and the same was dismissed vide order dated 2.2.2016 by the High Court of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur.
The online bids were submitted.
The CSIDC opened the tenders for determining whether the bidders satisfied the prequalification criteria.
Based upon the information supplied by the bidders, the CSIDC prepared charts of technical evaluation documents in the form of Annexures A B C and D which were signed by the Chief Executive Engineer and placed before the Tender Evaluation Committee in its meeting held on 03.03.2016.
The CSIDC filed a Technical Evaluation Sheet as Annexures R4/3 and 5/3 which was placed before the Technical Evaluation Committee whereas the petitioner in the High Court i.e. M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd. filed the document Annexure P4 as technical evaluation document.5.
It is pertinent to mention here that the documents of technical evaluation filed by CSIDC were signed by the Executive Engineer and the document filed by M s. Amar Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd. as Annexure P4 does not bear signatures of any official.6.
On 3.3.2016, Tender Evaluation Committee considered the matter and had drawn the minutes which is signed by Mr. S. Rajgire, Executive Engineer DivisionIV, Mr. G.V.S.P. Rao, Deputy Manager (Accounts) and Mr. Abdul Shakil, Chief Engineer.
Two bidders namely M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., Chhindwara and M s. Raipur Construction Pvt.
Ltd. were found qualified.
It has been opined by the Evaluation Committee that they fulfill all the requisite qualifications.
Hence, it was resolved unanimously to open the financial bids of the aforesaid two bidders.
The financial bids were ultimately opened on 5.3.2016.
The bid submitted by M s. Raipur Construction Pvt. Ltd. was ranked as L1 as compared to that of M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd.
Chhindwara whose bid was ranked as L2.
Ultimately the bid L1 of M s. Raipur Construction Pvt. Ltd. had been accepted on 8.7.2016 and work order had been issued by the CSIDC to M s. Raipur Construction Pvt.
Ltd.7.
The petitioner respondent herein, namely, M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd. was disqualified on the ground that its construction experience was not found as per the requisite criteria indicated in experience certificate, quantity of DLC (M10) i.e. 3194 cum submitted under the key activities of construction experience of requisite quantity of work done was not in accordance with the nomenclature of PWD SOR.
In the nomenclature of DLC in SOR there was no M20 type of concrete, as such the amount of DLC as presented in the certificate had been rejected.8.
It is pertinent to mention that Writ Petition No.664 of 2016 was filed before the High Court of Chhatisgarh at Bilaspur by M s. B.B. Verma, who was also one of the unsuccessful bidders, against the CSIDC and others.
In the said writ petition, the CSIDC had filed its reply dated 14.3.2016 and had submitted the document dated 3.3.2016 i.e. the chart containing technical evaluation in which the aforesaid facts were mentioned.
The writ petition preferred by M s. B.B. Verma was ultimately dismissed by the High Court of Chhatisgarh vide order dated 15.03.2016.9.
However, M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd. filed a representation on 1.4.2016 not against the successful bidder but against M s. Arcons Construction Pvt.
Ltd. to the effect that it had been found eligible for opening financial bid despite not having a Hot Mix Plant.
After the writ petition in question was filed on 8.4.2016 in the High Court, reply was filed by the CSIDC on 7.7.2016.10.
The High Court, considering the discrepancy in the document of technical evaluation which was filed by the M s. Amar Infrastructure Limited and the one filed by the CSIDC, had vide order dated 28.07.2016 directed the Superintendent of Police, Raipur to depute an independent and competent officer from the Cyber Crime Cell of the State Police to inspect, examine and analyse the data available on the computer of the CSIDC and to determine the following points1.
What was the initial bid document efiled by Respondent No.6.2.
Whether in the tender document submitted by respondent no.6, the list of plant and machinery contained hot mix plant or not?
Whether said list was certified by the authorised signatory or not?3.
The concerned Officer will after examining the documents also determine whether the document AnnexureP/4 has been prepared on the computer of the CSIDC or not?4.
The officer shall also intimate the date of preparation of the document Annexure R4,5/3 filed by the CSIDC and clearly intimate when the document was initially prepared and if any changes were made to this document then on what date.

The perusal of Document Test reports (I pages) and C.D.s as well as chips concluded by the Cyber Celll Specialist is submitted.
Attachment As per above points.12.
The report was filed on 11.11.2016 and the High Court has found that the document which were placed on record one filed by the CSIDC and other filed by the appellant were substantially different with respect to the fact whether Hot Mix Plant was owned by
M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and also that modification had been made in the document on 4.7.2016.
Thus, the High Court had opined that L2 tenderer basically was not qualified to participate and had been made to qualify for opening of its financial bid in order to give the contract anyhow or somehow to M s. Raipur Construction Pvt.
Ltd.
It concluded that M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. was illegally included in the qualified list of bidders by the Technical Evaluation Committee in its meeting dated 3.3.2016, and thus, the contract granted to
M s. Raipur Construction Pvt. Ltd. has been quashed and at the same time further police investigation has been ordered so as to fix the responsibility for the manipulations made in the document filed by the CSIDC and or by M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd.13.
Aggrieved thereby the appeals have been preferred in this Court.14.
Mr. Mukul Rohatagi, learned Attorney General alongwith Mr. Apoorv Kurup, Mr. A.C. Boxipatro and Mr. Ashish Kumar Sinha, appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted that there is no manipulation in the Technical Evaluation Bid Sheet and prequalification criteria was fulfilled by both the tenderers whose financial bids were opened.
Owning Hot Mix Plant was not a mandatory condition and thus it could not be said that the technical evaluation was illegal in any manner whatsoever.
The financial bids of the qualified tenderers were required to be opened and Hot Mix Plant was not in the list of plant and equipments which were necessary to be possessed to qualify at the prequalification stage.15.
It was also submitted by the learned Attorney General that the High Court has unnecessarily doubted the documents of Technical Evaluation Sheet placed on record by the CSIDC.
It had been filed within seven days of the finalisation of the financial bid in the High Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in the writ application which was preferred by M s. B.B. Verma which was dismissed on 15.3.2016 relying upon the very same documents which have been filed by the CSIDC in the instant writ application also.
The document which has been filed by
M s. Amar Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. is not signed by anybody and even if taken to be an assessment made with respect to the entire tender documents by CSIDC, hot mix plant being not a prerequisite and essential to be possessed for opening of the financial bid, the reasoning employed by the High Court that L2 was got qualified only in order to ensure that financial bid of L1 could be opened so that it would not be left as the only tenderer, whose financial bid then could not have been opened being only bidder in the fray and retendering would have been necessitated, falls down.16.
Mr. Garvesh Kabra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent ingeniously submitted that other tenderer had been disqualified namely M s. Anil Buildcon (I) Pvt.
Ltd. on the basis of not possessing the requisite concrete paver
and it is apparent from the Technical Evaluation Sheet filed by the respondent as P4 that the L2 tenderer M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. did not possess Hot Mix Plant at the time of submitting the tender which fact was noted in the requisite column of the evaluation sheet (P4).
He has also submitted that it was necessary to submit all the documents alongwith the tender forms including what were mentioned in Schedule D Section
V. Thus, it was submitted by the learned counsel that there had been manipulation made at the instance of the CSIDC as Technical Evaluation Sheet filed by CSIDC does not tally with the technical evaluation document filed by the petitioner before the High Court.
It appears that manipulation had been done in the document as observed by the High Court on 4th July, 2016.
The High Court has rightly disqualified L2, and thus it became necessary to invite the fresh bids as per the prevailing norms.
Consequently, the order had been passed by the High Court, keeping in view the report of the Cyber Crime Cell.
Hence no case for interference is made out in the appeals.
The order passed by the High Court is on proper consideration.17.
In order to appreciate the rival submissions, it is necessary to consider the tender document itself and the requirements for prequalification.
Whether having Hot Mix Plant was necessary qualification?
In the tender document, list is given, the same is extracted as under (a) Only Schedule A and Section 1 of Schedule D are to be filled signed by the tenderer(b) All the certificates as per pre qualification criteria shall be appended with relevant forms of schedule D.1.

It is pertinent to mention here that in said list of mandatory plant etc. necessary for prequalification criteria, the Hot Mix Plant is not mentioned.
Thus, it was not a prerequisite to qualify for opening financial bid.28.
Apart from that, when we peruse the list of minimum plant, equipments and shuttering provided in clause 51 of the contract document, 18 items have been mentioned in which again the Hot Mix Plant is not mentioned in the list of Minimum plant equipment and Shuttering.

In case, any of the aforesaid minimum equipment is not available and certificate is not appended to the bid, the financial bid was not to be opened.30.
The Hot Mix Plant finds place in different Section V of Schedule D. A bare reading of Schedule D Section V makes it clear that though it was part of tender form and was in the list of approved tools and machinery to be used for road work, it was not necessary for the purpose of technical evaluation at the stage of prequalification for opening of financial bid.31.
Considering the aforesaid various clauses, we are of the considered opinion that both the bidders L1 and L2 i.e. M s. Raipur Construction Pvt. Ltd. and
M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. were technically qualified for opening of their financial bids.
The opinion expressed by the High Court that L2 was made to be qualified in spite of the fact that it was not having Hot Mix Plant, thus, cannot be accepted as available ground to disqualify L2 tenderer.
The relevant clauses of the tender document were not placed for consideration before the High Court as mentioned by the High Court and at last moment the Hot Mix Plant inclusion in Schedule D Section V was indicated to it by the disqualified contractor.
In our opinion, Hot Mix Plant was not a mandatory requirement so as to open the financial bid.
Thus, the financial bids of the two tenderers who succeeded at the prequalification stage had been rightly opened and considered.
In our opinion, M s. Raipur Construction was not favoured by qualifying the disqualified tenderer  M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt Ltd to give the contract to it in surreptitious method and manner as observed by the High Court.
M s. Arcons Infrastructure was, in fact, rightly qualified.32.
This Court in Tejas Constructions and Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. v. Municipal Council, Sendhwa and Anr.
(2012) 6 SCC 464 has laid down that when the work is 60 per cent complete, Court should be slow to interfere as retendering would delay the project.
In the absence of malafide or arbitrariness which is not made out in the instant case as 50 per cent of the work had been completed when the order was passed by the High Court, hence, no interference was warranted in the present case.33.
Now, we advert to the question of manipulation in the technical evaluation sheet which has been placed on record by the CSIDC in the form of document R4/3 and 5/3 and by M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd. as Annexure P4 in the High Court.34.
The Cyber Crime Cell has observed that some modification was made on 4th July, 2016, in the technical evaluation bid document P4, a copy of which was filed by the respondent i.e. M s. Amar Infrastructure Limited in the month of April.
It was also not reported what change was made in P4.
There was no such manipulation reported in the document of technical evaluation filed by the CSIDC in the High Court.
We have seen the stand of CSIDC in its reply to the Writ Application preferred by M s B.B. Verma which was dismissed by the High Court after looking into same technical evaluation report.
The similar stand had been taken by the CSIDC and the very same document of technical evaluation had been placed on record in the aforesaid case as is apparent from the pleadings to which our attention has been drawn by the learned Attorney General.
The document relied upon by the CSIDC had been placed on record of said case within a week of finalisation of the financial bid.
Immediate filing of the same and taking the stand to the similar effect as has been taken in this matter also vouch for the correctness of document which has been filed by the CSIDC and there is no manipulation in it.
As per report of the cyber crime cell also there is no manipulation in the document which has been relied upon by the CSIDC.
The question of manipulation as to Hot Mix Plant is of no consequence as it was not a mandatory criteria for opening of financial bid.
The ownership or otherwise of the hot mix plant was not at all necessary and the plant was not required as mandatory one for the purpose of prequalification stage for opening of financial bid.
It was only in the list of approved plant and equipments to be used under the certification of the Engineerincharge.
It appears that the document P4 which had been filed by M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd. contained the evaluation sheet but it was not as per requirement of aforesaid various clauses necessary for prequalification stage and nonsubmission of the information as contended by M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd. could not have disqualified M s. Arcons Infrastructure and Constructions Pvt.
Ltd.
Thus, what was the necessary requirement as per criteria for opening of the financial evaluation had been rightly placed before the Technical Evaluation Committee on 3.3.2016.
We have perused the original Minutes and the technical evaluation document filed by CSIDC which were placed before Technical Evaluation Committee, and was signed by the Executive Engineer and had been considered by the Technical Evaluation Committee.
The minutes of the Technical Evaluation Committee had also been signed by the aforesaid three officers.
Apart from that in the minutes of Technical Evaluation Committee meeting dated 3.3.2016, details of qualifications have been mentioned and that accords with the document of evaluation sheet which has been relied upon by the CSIDC.35.
In our opinion, as the hot mix plant was not a mandatory requirement so as to open the financial bid, we decline to go into the submission raised on behalf of the appellants that M s. Amar Infrastructure Limited has not disclosed how and when and from whom and by which process it obtained the document P4 which is not signed by anybody as the fact remains that the document which is filed by the respondent also existed in the computer of the CSIDC.
However, it looms in insignificance owing to the conclusions to which we have reached with respect to the Hot Mix Plant.
May be that this document P4 was also prepared by somebody in the CSIDC but it was not initialed or signed by anybody.
It depicted the position of entire tender of L2 but what was mandatory requirement for prequalification stage and technical evaluation was correctly placed before the Technical Evaluation Committee in the form of document R4/3 and R5/3.
In view of the aforesaid, we are of the opinion that the report of the Cyber Crime Cell is of no consequence with respect to prequalification criteria and opening of financial bids, since it is not disputed that successful tenderer L1 fulfilled all conditions and had Hot Mix Plant also.36.
There was no manipulation in the mandatory requirements and may be that P4 was prepared but that was of no consequence as deficiency of Hot Mix Plant, even if placed before Committee, would not have tilted the balance in favour of the respondent M s. Amar Infrastructure Limited.
The Committee on that basis could not have disqualified the L2 tenderer.37.
Coming to the submission raised by the learned counsel for the respondent that M s. Anil Buildcon (I) Pvt.
Ltd. was disqualified for not possessing concrete paver as such L2 tenderer M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt
. Ltd. also ought to have been disqualified for deficiency of Hot Mix Plant, we are unable to accept the submission as concrete paver was mentioned in the list of mandatory plant and equipment for prequalification stage so as to open financial bid.
Thus, this submission is found to be baseless.
M s Anil Buildcon (I) Pvt.
Ltd. was rightly disqualified.38.
We also find that M s. Amar Infrastructure Ltd. itself was disqualified and it had not questioned the qualification of the successful bidder but that of L2 bidder  M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd. on ground that it was not qualified and its financial bid had been illegally opened.
It was purely a fight between the rival tenderers involving no element of public interest.
It was the respondent who was trying to cater to its business interest to ensure retendering by seeking disqualification of L2 tenderer M s. Arcons Infrastructure Pvt.
Ltd. to whom contract had not been given.
The Court has to be loath in such matter to make interference.39.
Resultantly, we find that there was no merit in the writ petition filed by the respondent in the High Court.
Thus, we have no hesitation in setting aside the impugned judgment, order and directions passed by the High Court.
The appeals are allowed.
Parties to bear their own costs as incurred.
